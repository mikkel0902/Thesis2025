All files are accessible in the Github folder. To ensure that readers can understand the source behind the data that forms the study, a guide is included:
1) Variables: code to collect inputs needed for data sample
2) Event study breach: code for the event study, and the csv file containing the data obtained from WRDS.
3) Event study after: code for the second event study, and the csv file containing the data obtained from WRDS.
4) Cyber language analysis: this folder contains data that scraped the entirety of 10-K filings for words relating to cyber security, and total words in 10-K filing
5) Sentiment analysis: data collection to conduct sentiment analysis on MD&A. There are multiple folders, where some are called manual. This is because some MD&A sections could not be scraped automatically due to difference in formats. The "manual" folders contain .txt files with each MD&A
6) Regression analysis: the final analysis that forms the analysis in the thesis
