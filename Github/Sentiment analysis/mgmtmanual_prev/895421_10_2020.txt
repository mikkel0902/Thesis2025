Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Introduction
Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of its business segments—Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management. Morgan Stanley, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Morgan Stanley,” “Firm,” “us,” “we” or “our” mean Morgan Stanley (the “Parent Company”) together with its consolidated subsidiaries. See the “Glossary of Common Terms and Acronyms” for the definition of certain terms and acronyms used throughout this Form 10-K.

2019 Compared with 2018
•
We reported net revenues of $41,419 million in 2019 compared with $40,107 million in 2018. For 2019, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $9,042 million, or $5.19 per diluted common share, compared with $8,748 million, or $4.73 per diluted common share, in 2018.
•
Results for 2019 and 2018 include intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $348 million and $203 million or $0.21 and $0.12 per diluted common share, respectively, primarily associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest as a result of new information pertaining to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations.
•
Excluding the intermittent net discrete tax items, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $8,694 million, or $4.98 per diluted common share in 2019, compared with $8,545 million, or $4.61 per diluted common share, in 2018 (see “Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information” herein).

2019 Compared with 2018
•
Compensation and benefits expenses of $18,837 million in 2019 increased 7% from $17,632 million in 2018. The 2019 results reflect increases in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced, carried interest, salaries, and severance-related costs. These increases were partially offset by decreases in discretionary incentive compensation and the roll-off of certain acquisition-related employee retention loans.
•
Non-compensation expenses of $11,281 million in 2019 were relatively unchanged from $11,238 million in 2018, with increased investment in technology offset by lower professional services expenses.

2019 Compared with 2018
•
Institutional Securities net revenues of $20,386 million in 2019 were relatively unchanged from 2018, reflecting a mixed market backdrop, with lower revenues from Equity sales and trading and Investment banking offset by higher Fixed income and Other sales and trading revenues.
•
Wealth Management net revenues of $17,737 million in 2019 increased 3% from 2018, primarily reflecting higher Transactional revenues due to gains related to investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans.
•
Investment Management net revenues of $3,763 million in 2019 increased 37% from 2018, primarily reflecting higher Investments revenues, principally driven by an underlying investment's initial public offering within an Asia private equity fund.

Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information
We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain “non-GAAP financial measures” in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, definitive proxy statement and otherwise. A “non-GAAP financial measure” excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing, our financial condition, operating results, prospective regulatory capital requirements or capital adequacy.
These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable

Adjusted amounts exclude net discrete tax provisions (benefits) that are intermittent and include those that are recurring. Provisions (benefits) related to conversion of employee share-based awards are expected to occur every year and, as such, are considered recurring discrete tax items. For further information on the net discrete tax provisions (benefits), see “Supplemental Financial Information—Income Tax Matters” herein.
2.
ROE and ROTCE represent earnings applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively. When excluding intermittent net discrete tax provisions (benefits), both the numerator and average denominator are adjusted.
3.
The calculations used in determining our “ROE and ROTCE Targets” referred to in the following section are the Adjusted ROE and Adjusted ROTCE amounts shown in this table.
4.
Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements—Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework” herein).
5.
The sums of the segments' Average common equity and Average tangible common equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent equity.
6.
The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses net income applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment.

Return on Equity and Tangible Common Equity Targets
We previously established an ROE Target of 10% to 13%, and an ROTCE Target of 11.5% to 14.5%. Excluding the impact of intermittent net discrete tax items, we generated an 11.2% ROE and a 12.9% ROTCE for 2019.
In January 2020, we established a new ROTCE Target of 13% to 15% to be achieved over the next two years.
Our ROTCE Target is a forward-looking statement that may be materially affected by many factors, including, among other things: macroeconomic and market conditions; legislative and regulatory developments; industry trading and investment banking volumes; equity market levels; interest rate environment; outsized legal expenses or penalties; the ability to maintain a reduced level of expenses; and capital levels. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for additional information.
For non-GAAP measures (ROTCE and ROE excluding intermittent net discrete tax items), see “Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information” herein. For information on the impact of intermittent net discrete tax items, see “Supplemental Financial Information—Income Tax Matters” herein.
Business Segments
Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures. See Note 21 to the financial statements for information on intersegment transactions.
Net Revenues
Investment Banking 
Investment banking revenues are derived from client engagements in which we act as an adviser, underwriter or distributor of capital.
Within the Institutional Securities business segment, these revenues are primarily composed of fees earned from underwriting equity and fixed income securities, syndicating loans and advisory services in relation to mergers, acquisitions and restructurings.
Within the Wealth Management business segment, these revenues are derived from the distribution of newly issued securities.
Trading
Trading revenues include the realized gains and losses from transactions in financial instruments, unrealized gains and losses
 
from ongoing changes in the fair value of our positions and gains and losses from financial instruments used to economically hedge compensation expense related to certain employee deferred compensation plans.
Within the Institutional Securities business segment, Trading revenues arise from transactions in cash instruments and derivatives in which we act as a market maker for our clients. In this role, we stand ready to buy, sell or otherwise transact with customers under a variety of market conditions and to provide firm or indicative prices in response to customer requests. Our liquidity obligations can be explicit in some cases, and in others, customers expect us to be willing to transact with them. In order to most effectively fulfill our market-making function, we engage in activities across all of our trading businesses that include, but are not limited to:
•
taking positions in anticipation of, and in response to, customer demand to buy or sell and—depending on the liquidity of the relevant market and the size of the position—to hold those positions for a period of time;
•
building, maintaining and rebalancing inventory through trades with other market participants;
•
managing and assuming basis risk (risk associated with imperfect hedging) between customized customer risks and the standardized products available in the market to hedge those risks;
•
trading in the market to remain current on pricing and trends; and
•
engaging in other activities to provide efficiency and liquidity for markets.
In many markets, the realized and unrealized gains and losses from purchase and sale transactions will include any spreads between bids and offers. Certain fees received on loans carried at fair value and dividends from equity securities are also recorded in Trading revenues since they relate to positions carried at fair value.
Within the Wealth Management business segment, Trading revenues primarily include revenues from customers’ purchases and sales of fixed income instruments in which we act as principal, and gains and losses related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans.
Investments
Investments revenues are composed of realized and unrealized gains and losses derived from investments, including those associated with employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans. Estimates of the fair value of the investments that produce these revenues may involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business,

market, economic and financial conditions, generally or in relation to specific transactions.
Within the Institutional Securities segment, gains and losses are primarily from business-related investments. Certain investments are subject to sale restrictions. Typically, there are no fee revenues from these investments.
Within the Investment Management business segment, Investments revenues, in addition to gains and losses from investments, include performance-based fees in the form of carried interest, a portion of which is subject to reversal. The business is entitled to receive carried interest when the return in certain funds exceeds specified performance targets. Additionally, there are certain sponsored Investment Management funds consolidated by us where revenues are primarily attributable to holders of noncontrolling interests.
Commissions and Fees 
Commissions and fees result from arrangements in which the client is charged a fee for executing transactions related to securities, services related to sales and trading activities, and sales of other products.
Within the Institutional Securities business segment, commissions and fees include fees earned from trading activities, such as executing and clearing client transactions on major stock and derivative exchanges, as well as from OTC derivatives.
Within the Wealth Management business segment, commissions and fees primarily arise from client transactions in equity securities, insurance products, mutual funds, futures and options.
Asset Management 
Asset management revenues include fees associated with the management and supervision of assets, and the distribution of funds and similar products.
Within the Wealth Management business segment, Asset management revenues are associated with advisory services and management of assets, account service and administration, as well as distribution of products. These revenues are generally based on the net asset value of the account in which a client is invested.
Within the Investment Management business segment, Asset management revenues are primarily composed of fees received from mutual fund daily average net assets or based on monthly or quarterly invested equity for other vehicles. Performance-based fees, not in the form of carried interest, are earned on certain products and separately managed accounts as a percentage of appreciation generally earned by those products and, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement of
 
performance criteria. These performance fees are generally recognized annually.
Net Interest
Interest income and Interest expense are functions of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including Trading assets and Trading liabilities, Investment securities (which include AFS and HTM securities), Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, Loans, Deposits and Borrowings.
Within the Institutional Securities business segment, Net interest is a function of market-making strategies, customer activity in the prime brokerage business, and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates. Net interest is impacted by market-making activities as securities held by the Firm earn interest, while securities that are loaned, borrowed, sold with agreements to repurchase and purchased with agreements to resell incur interest expense.
Within the Wealth Management business segment, Interest income is driven by Investment securities, Loans and margin loans. Interest expense is driven by Deposits and other funding.
Other
Other revenues for Institutional Securities include revenues and losses from equity method investments, lending commitments, fees earned in association with lending activities and the provision for loan losses.
Other revenues for Wealth Management are derived from realized gains and losses on AFS securities, the provision for loan losses, account handling fees, referral fees and other miscellaneous revenues.
Institutional Securities—Sales and Trading Revenues
Sales and trading net revenues are composed of Trading revenues, Commissions and fees, Asset management revenues and Net interest. These revenues, which can be impacted by a variety of interrelated market factors, including volumes, bid-offer spreads and inventory prices, as well as the impact of hedging activity, are viewed in the aggregate when assessing the performance and profitability of our sales and trading activities. We make transaction-related decisions based on, among other things, an assessment of the potential gain or loss associated with a transaction, including any associated commissions and fees, dividends, or net interest income, any costs associated with financing or hedging our positions and other related expenses.
Following is a description of the sales and trading activities within our equity and fixed income businesses, as well as how their results impact the income statement line items.

Equity—Financing. We provide financing, prime brokerage and fund administration services to our clients active in the equity markets through a variety of products, including margin lending, securities lending and swaps. Results from this business are largely driven by the difference between financing income earned and financing costs incurred, which are reflected in Net interest for securities and equity lending products, and in Trading revenues for derivative products. Fees for providing fund administration services are reflected in Asset management revenues.
Equity—Execution services. A significant portion of the results for this business is generated by commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on major stock and derivative exchanges, as well as from OTC transactions. We make markets for our clients in equity-related securities and derivative products, including those that provide liquidity and are utilized for hedging. Market making also generates gains and losses on positions held in inventory, which are reflected in Trading revenues.
Fixed income—Within fixed income, we make markets in various flow and structured products in order to facilitate client activity as part of the following products and services:
•
Global macro products. We make markets for our clients in interest rate, foreign exchange and emerging market products, including exchange-traded and OTC securities and derivative instruments. The results of this market-making activity are primarily driven by gains and losses from buying and selling positions to stand ready for and satisfy client demand and are recorded in Trading revenues.
•
Credit products. We make markets in credit-sensitive products, such as corporate bonds and mortgage securities and other securitized products, and related derivative instruments. The values of positions in this business are sensitive to changes in credit spreads and interest rates, which result in gains and losses reflected in Trading revenues. We undertake lending activities, which include commercial mortgage lending, asset-backed lending and financing extended to customers. Due to the amount and type of the interest-bearing securities and loans making up this business, a significant portion of the results is also reflected in Net interest revenues.
•
Commodities products and Other. We make markets in various commodity products related primarily to electricity, natural gas, oil and metals. Other activities primarily include results from the centralized management of our fixed income derivative counterparty exposures and managing derivative counterparty risk on behalf of clients. These activities are primarily recorded in Trading revenues.
Other sales and trading revenues include impacts from certain treasury functions, such as liquidity costs and gains and losses on economic hedges related to certain borrowings, certain activities associated with corporate lending, as well as gains and
 
losses from financial instruments used to economically hedge compensation expense related to certain employee deferred compensation plans.
Compensation Expense
Compensation and benefits expenses include base salaries and fixed allowances, formulaic programs, discretionary incentive compensation, amortization of deferred cash and equity awards, changes in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced, carried interest allocated to employees, severance costs, and other items such as health and welfare benefits.
The factors that drive compensation for our employees vary from period to period, from segment to segment and within a segment. For certain revenue-producing employees in the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, compensation is largely paid on the basis of formulaic payouts that link employee compensation to revenues. Compensation for other employees, including revenue-producing employees in the Institutional Securities business segment, include base salary and benefits, and may also include incentive compensation that is determined following the assessment of the Firm’s, business unit’s and individual’s performance.
Compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation plans is recognized over the relevant vesting period and is adjusted based on the notional earnings of the referenced investments until distribution. Although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the Firm, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the Firm's investments and the compensation expense recognized over the vesting period.
Income Taxes
The income tax provision for our business segments is generally determined based on the revenues, expenses and activities directly attributable to each business segment. Certain items have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues or other relevant measures.

2019 Compared with 2018
Investment banking revenues of $5,734 million in 2019 decreased 6% from 2018, reflecting lower results in our advisory business.
•
Advisory revenues decreased primarily as a result of lower volumes of completed M&A activity.
•
Equity underwriting revenues were relatively unchanged as lower revenues in initial public offerings were offset by higher revenues in secondary block share trades.
•
Fixed income underwriting revenues were essentially unchanged as lower non-investment grade loan issuance fees were offset by higher fees from bond and investment grade loan issuances.

2019 Compared with 2018

Equity
Equity sales and trading net revenues of $8,056 million in 2019 decreased 10% from 2018, reflecting lower results in both our financing and execution services businesses.
•
Financing decreased from 2018, primarily due to lower realized spreads and commissions, reflected in lower Trading revenues.

•
Execution services decreased from 2018, reflecting lower Trading revenues as a result of less favorable inventory management in derivatives products due to lower levels of volatility. In addition, Commissions and fees decreased driven by changes in market volumes and commission mix in cash equities products.

Fixed Income
Fixed income net revenues of $5,546 million in 2019 were 11% higher than 2018, primarily driven by higher results in credit products, partially offset by lower results in global macro products.
•
Global macro products Trading revenues decreased primarily due to inventory management losses in certain foreign exchange and rates products as a result of movements in foreign exchange volatility and a decline in interest rates.
•
Credit products Trading revenues increased, primarily due to improved inventory management in corporate credit and securitized products and higher client activity in securitized products.
•
Commodities products and Other Trading revenues increased as gains from counterparty risk management were offset by lower client activity in commodities.
Fixed income Net interest increased compared with 2018, primarily reflecting changes in funding mix, partially offset by lower net spreads in securitized products.

Other
•
Other sales and trading revenues of $93 million in 2019 increased from 2018, reflecting an increase in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced and changes in funding mix, partially offset by higher losses on hedges associated with corporate loans.

Investments, Other Revenues, Non-interest Expenses and Income Tax Items

2019 Compared with 2018

Investments
•
In 2019, net investment gains of $325 million were higher compared with 2018, primarily as a result of realized gains associated with an investment's initial public offering in 2019.
 
Other Revenues
•
Other revenues of $632 million in 2019 increased from 2018, primarily as a result of mark-to-market gains in 2019 compared with losses in 2018 on loans held for sale. This increase was partially offset by a higher provision for loan losses, which in 2018 included the recovery of a previously charged off loan, and lower results in our Japanese joint venture Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd. (“MUMSS”).

Non-interest Expenses
Non-interest expenses of $14,896 million in 2019 increased from 2018, reflecting a 7% increase in Compensation and benefits expenses and a 1% increase in Non-compensation expenses.
•
Compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2019, primarily due to an increase in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced, higher salaries and severance-related costs, partially offset by decreases in discretionary incentive compensation.
•
Non-compensation expenses increased in 2019, reflecting higher investments in technology, partially offset by lower professional services expenses.

Income Tax Items
Intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $317 million and $182 million were recognized in Provision for income taxes in 2019 and 2018, respectively. For further information, see “Supplemental Financial Information—Income Tax Matters” herein.

Net Revenues

Transactional Revenues
Transactional revenues of $2,969 million in 2019 increased 16%, primarily as a result of higher Trading revenues, partially offset by lower Commissions and fees.
•
Investment banking revenues increased in 2019, primarily due to higher revenues from closed-end fund issuances.
•
Trading revenues increased in 2019, primarily due to gains related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans, partially offset by lower fixed income revenues driven by product mix.
•
Commissions and fees decreased in 2019, primarily due to changes in the mix of client activity in equities, partially offset by increased client activity in alternative products.

Asset Management
Asset management revenues of $10,199 million in 2019 were relatively unchanged compared with 2018, reflecting the effect of higher fee-based client assets levels due to market appreciation in 2019 and positive net flows, partially offset by the effect of lower fee-based client assets levels at the beginning of the year due to significant market declines in the fourth quarter of 2018, and lower average fee rates predominantly driven by shifts in the mix of fee-based client assets.
See “Fee-Based Client Assets Rollforwards” herein.

Other
Other revenues of $345 million in 2019 increased 39%, primarily due to higher realized gains from the AFS securities portfolio.

Net interest of $4,222 million in 2019 was relatively unchanged compared with 2018, as higher costs due to changes in our funding mix and higher prepayment amortization expense related to mortgage-backed securities were offset by the impact of higher balances of and higher interest rates on Loans, and higher investment portfolio yields.
In addition, we centralized certain internal treasury activities as of January 1, 2019, which partially offset Interest income and Interest expense compared with the prior periods. The effect on Net interest income was not significant in 2019.

Non-interest Expenses
Non-interest expenses of $12,905 million in 2019 were relatively unchanged compared with 2018, as higher Compensation and benefits expenses were offset by lower Non-compensation expenses.
•
Compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2019, primarily due to increases in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced and salaries, partially offset by the roll-off of certain acquisition-related employee retention loans.
•
Non-compensation expenses decreased in 2019, primarily as a result of lower professional services expenses and lower deposit insurance expense.

2019 Compared with 2018

Net Revenues

Investments
Investments revenues of $1,213 million in 2019 compared with $254 million in 2018 reflect higher unrealized carried interest and investment gains primarily from an Asia private equity fund, principally driven by the initial public offering of an underlying investment, which is subject to certain sales restrictions.

Asset Management
Asset management revenues of $2,629 million in 2019 increased 7% compared with 2018, primarily as a result of higher average AUM and higher performance-based fees driven by real estate funds and the monetization of a client asset in 2019.
See “Assets Under Management or Supervision” herein.

Other
Other losses were $46 million in 2019 and $30 million in 2018, primarily reflecting impairments of two distinct equity method investments in third-party asset managers, one in each year.

Non-interest Expenses
Non-interest expenses of $2,778 million in 2019 increased 22% from 2018, primarily as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses.
•
Compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2019, primarily due to higher compensation associated with carried interest.
•
Non-compensation expenses increased in 2019, primarily as a result of higher fee sharing driven by higher average AUM.

1.
The adjusted effective income tax rate is a non-GAAP measure that excludes net discrete tax provisions (benefits) that are intermittent and includes those that are recurring. For further information on non-GAAP measures, see “Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information” herein.
2.
Provisions (benefits) related to conversion of employee share-based awards are expected to occur every year and, as such, are considered recurring discrete tax items.
3.
Includes all tax provisions (benefits) that have been determined to be discrete, other than Recurring items as defined above.
The effective tax rates for 2019 and 2018 include intermittent net discrete tax benefits primarily associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest as a result of new information pertaining to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations.
The effective tax rate reflects our current assumptions, estimates and interpretations related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 (“Tax Act”) and other factors. For a further discussion of the Tax Act, see Note 20 to the financial statements.
U.S. Bank Subsidiaries
Our U.S. bank subsidiaries, Morgan Stanley Bank N.A. (“MSBNA”) and Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association (“MSPBNA”) (collectively, “U.S. Bank Subsidiaries”) accept deposits, provide loans to a variety of customers, from large corporate and institutional clients to high net worth individuals, and invest in securities. Lending activity recorded in the U.S. Bank subsidiaries from the Institutional Securities business segment primarily includes loans and lending commitments to corporate clients. Lending activity recorded in the U.S. Bank subsidiaries from the Wealth Management business segment primarily includes securities-based lending, which allows clients to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities, and residential real estate loans.
We expect our lending activities to continue to grow through further market penetration of our client base. For a further discussion of our credit risks, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Credit Risk.” For a further discussion about loans and lending commitments, see Notes 8 and 13 to the financial statements.

Other Matters
Deferred Cash-Based Compensation
The Firm sponsors a number of employee deferred cash-based compensation programs. For eligible employees, a portion of their year-end discretionary incentive compensation is awarded in the form of deferred cash-based compensation. Such deferred compensation awards generally contain vesting, clawback, forfeiture and cancellation provisions. Additionally, there are certain other deferred cash-based programs that allow employees to defer the receipt of current compensation to a future date.
Employees are permitted to allocate the notional value of their deferred awards among a menu of investments, whereby the notional value of their awards will track the performance of the referenced investments. The menu of investments, which is selected by the Firm, includes fixed income, equity, commodity and money market funds.

Table of Contents
 
Management's Discussion and Analysis
mslogo.jpg

Compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation awards is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments that employees select. Compensation expense is recognized over the relevant vesting period for each separate vesting portion of deferred awards.
Correspondingly, the Firm invests directly, as a principal, in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge its obligations under these deferred cash-based compensation plans. Changes in the value of such investments made by the Firm are recorded in Trading and Investments revenues. Although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the Firm, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the Firm’s investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period. While this timing difference is generally not material to Income from continuing operations before income taxes in any individual period, it may impact Firm reported ratios (e.g., the Expense efficiency ratio) in certain periods.

Accounting Development Updates
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates that apply to us. Accounting updates not listed below were assessed and either determined to be not applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements.
The following accounting update was adopted on January 1, 2020:

•
Financial Instruments—Credit Losses. This accounting update impacts the impairment model for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost by requiring a CECL methodology to estimate expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial asset, recorded at inception or purchase. CECL replaces the loss model currently applicable to loans held for investment, HTM securities and other receivables carried at amortized cost, such as employee loans.
The update also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment for AFS securities and instead requires impairments on AFS securities to be recognized in earnings through an allowance when the fair value is less than amortized cost and a credit loss exists or the securities are expected to be sold before recovery of amortized cost.
For certain portfolios, we have determined that there are no expected credit losses; for example, based on collateral arrangements for lending and financing transactions, such as Securities borrowed, Securities purchased under agreements to resell and certain other portfolios. Also, we have a zero loss expectation for certain financial assets based on the credit quality of the borrower or issuer, such as U.S. government and agency securities.
At transition on January 1, 2020, the adoption of this accounting standard resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $131 million with a corresponding reduction in Retained earnings of $100 million, net of tax. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily attributable to employee loans, commercial real estate loans and securities, and residential real estate loans, partially offset by a decrease primarily in secured lending facilities within corporate loans. Prior period amounts will not be restated.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements), the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.
Fair Value
Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value
A significant number of our financial instruments are carried at fair value. We make estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the financial statements. These assets and liabilities include, but are not limited to:
•
Trading assets and Trading liabilities;
•
Investment Securities—AFS securities;
 
•
Certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell;
•
Certain Deposits, primarily certificates of deposit;
•
Certain Securities sold under agreements to repurchase;
•
Certain Other secured financings; and
•
Certain Borrowings.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches. A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels, wherein Level 1 represents quoted prices in active markets, Level 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, require the greatest use of judgment.
In periods of market disruption, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments, which could cause an instrument to be recategorized from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many instruments. For further information on the definition of fair value, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation techniques, and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements, see Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements.
Where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty, concentration risk and funding in order to arrive at fair value. For a further discussion of valuation adjustments that we apply, see Note 2 to the financial statements.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill
We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of July 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. Evaluating goodwill for impairment requires management to make significant judgments. Goodwill impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below our business segments. Goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit. As such, all the activities

December 2019 Form 10-K
42
 
Table of Contents
 
Management's Discussion and Analysis
mslogo.jpg

of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically developed, are available to support the value of the goodwill.
For both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to either (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative test would be performed.
When performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, limited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
The estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair value is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable companies. At each annual goodwill impairment testing date, each of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value.
Intangible Assets
Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows.
For both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset. Adverse market or economic events could result in impairment charges in future periods.
See Notes 2, 3 and 9 to the financial statements for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets.
Legal and Regulatory Contingencies
In the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution.
 
Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress.
We are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business and involving, among other matters, sales and trading activities, wealth and investment management services, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by us, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.
Accruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a case-by-case basis. Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and we can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, we accrue the estimated loss by a charge to income. In many proceedings, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss.
For certain legal proceedings and investigations, we can estimate possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued. For certain other legal proceedings and investigations, we cannot reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties.
Numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question.
Significant judgment is required in deciding when and if to make these accruals, and the actual cost of a legal claim or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals.
See Note 13 to the financial statements for additional information on legal contingencies.

Income Taxes
We are subject to the income and indirect tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also make estimates about when certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions.
Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each taxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years’ examinations, and unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits are established in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change.
Our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse.
Our deferred tax balances may also include deferred assets related to tax attribute carryforwards, such as net operating losses and tax credits that will be realized through reduction of future tax liabilities and, in some cases, are subject to expiration if not utilized within certain periods. We perform regular reviews to ascertain whether deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include management’s estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income and incorporate various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to tax attribute carryforwards before they expire.
Once the deferred tax asset balances have been determined, we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset balances to reflect the amount we estimate is more likely than not to be realized at a future date. Both current and deferred income taxes may reflect adjustments related to our unrecognized tax benefits.
Significant judgment is required in estimating the consolidated provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance, if any), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. Revisions in estimates and/or the actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any.
 
See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information on our significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes and Note 20 to the financial statements for additional information on our tax examinations.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Management Committee and the Board of Directors (“Board”), establishes and maintains our liquidity and capital policies. Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. The Treasury department, Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committee of the Board.
Balance Sheet
We monitor and evaluate the composition and size of our balance sheet on a regular basis. Our balance sheet management process includes quarterly planning, business segment thresholds, monitoring of business-specific usage versus key performance metrics and new business impact assessments.
We establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated and business segment levels. We monitor balance sheet utilization and review variances resulting from business activity and market fluctuations. On a regular basis, we review current performance versus established thresholds and assess the need to re-allocate the balance sheet based on business unit needs. We also monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size and capital usage.

Other assets primarily includes Goodwill and Intangible assets, premises, equipment and software, ROU assets related to leases, other investments and deferred tax assets.
A substantial portion of total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales and trading activities in the Institutional Securities business segment. Total assets increased to $895 billion at December 31, 2019 compared with $854 billion at December 31, 2018, driven by the Institutional Securities business segment. Within Institutional Securities, the primary increases were: Trading assets, primarily corporate equities in line with market conditions; Investment securities, primarily U.S. Treasuries; and continued Loan growth. These increases were partially offset by reduced Securities borrowed resulting from lower funding requirements. Wealth Management assets were lower primarily due to decreased Securities purchased under agreements to resell as a result of lower deposits in this segment, partially offset by continued Loan growth.
Liquidity Risk Management Framework
The primary goal of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework is to ensure that we have access to adequate funding across a wide range of market conditions and time horizons. The framework is designed to enable us to fulfill our financial obligations and support the execution of our business strategies.
The following principles guide our Liquidity Risk Management Framework:
•
Sufficient liquid assets should be maintained to cover maturing liabilities and other planned and contingent outflows;
•
Maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned, with limited reliance on short-term funding;
 
•
Source, counterparty, currency, region and term of funding should be diversified; and
•
Liquidity Stress Tests should anticipate, and account for, periods of limited access to funding.
The core components of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework that support our target liquidity profile are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity Stress Tests and the GLR.
Required Liquidity Framework
Our Required Liquidity Framework establishes the amount of liquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed environments to ensure that our financial condition and overall soundness are not adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet our financial obligations in a timely manner. The Required Liquidity Framework considers the most constraining liquidity requirement to satisfy all regulatory and internal limits at a consolidated and legal entity level.
Liquidity Stress Tests
We use Liquidity Stress Tests to model external and intercompany liquidity flows across multiple scenarios and a range of time horizons. These scenarios contain various combinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of different severity and duration. The methodology, implementation, production and analysis of our Liquidity Stress Tests are important components of the Required Liquidity Framework.
The assumptions used by us in our various Liquidity Stress Test scenarios include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
No government support;
•
No access to equity and unsecured debt markets;
•
Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress horizon;
•
Higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of secured funding;
•
Additional collateral that would be required by trading counterparties, certain exchanges and clearing organizations related to credit rating downgrades;
•
Additional collateral that would be required due to collateral substitutions, collateral disputes and uncalled collateral;
•
Discretionary unsecured debt buybacks;
•
Drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third parties; and

•
Client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short positions that fund long positions.
Liquidity Stress Tests are produced and results are reported at different levels, including major operating subsidiaries and major currencies, to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability across the Firm, including a limited number of asset sales in a stressed environment. The Liquidity Stress Tests assume that subsidiaries will use their own liquidity first to fund their obligations before drawing liquidity from the Parent Company and that the Parent Company will support its subsidiaries and will not have access to subsidiaries’ liquidity reserves. In addition to the assumptions underpinning the Liquidity Stress Tests, we take into consideration settlement risk related to intraday settlement and clearing of securities and financing activities.
At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in our Liquidity Stress Tests.
Global Liquidity Reserve
We maintain sufficient liquidity reserves to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests. The size of the GLR is actively managed by us considering the following components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a stressed environment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and collateral requirements.
In addition, our GLR includes a discretionary surplus based on risk tolerance and is subject to change depending on market and Firm-specific events. The GLR is held within the Parent Company and its major operating subsidiaries. The GLR consists of cash and unencumbered securities sourced from trading assets, investment securities and securities received as collateral.

GLR may fluctuate from period to period based on the overall size and composition of our balance sheet, the maturity profile of our unsecured debt and estimates of funding needs in a stressed environment, among other factors.
Regulatory Liquidity Framework
Liquidity Coverage Ratio
We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are subject to LCR requirements, including a requirement to calculate each entity’s LCR on each business day. The requirements are designed to ensure that banking organizations have sufficient HQLA to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days, thus promoting the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations.
The regulatory definition of HQLA is substantially the same as our GLR, with the primary difference being the treatment of certain cash balances and unencumbered securities.
As of December 31, 2019, we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are compliant with the minimum required LCR of 100%.

The decrease in the LCR in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 is primarily due to higher outflows related to secured funding and lower inflows related to secured lending.
Net Stable Funding Ratio
The NSFR requires banking organizations to maintain sufficiently stable sources of funding over a one-year horizon. In 2016, the U.S. banking agencies issued a proposal to implement the NSFR in the U.S.; however, a final rule has not yet been issued. If adopted, the requirements would apply to us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, and we expect to be in compliance by the effective date of any final rule.
Funding Management
We manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed.
We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources include our equity capital, borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies.
Secured Financing
The liquid nature of the marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales and trading activities in the Institutional Securities business segment provides us with flexibility in managing the composition and size of our balance sheet. Our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing. Secured financing investors principally focus on the quality of the eligible collateral posted. Accordingly, we actively manage our secured financings based on the quality of the assets being funded.
We have established longer tenor secured funding requirements for less liquid asset classes, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption. We define highly liquid assets
 
as government-issued or government-guaranteed securities with a high degree of fundability and less liquid assets as those that do not meet these criteria.
To further minimize the refinancing risk of secured financing for less liquid assets, we have established concentration limits to diversify our investor base and reduce the amount of monthly maturities for secured financing of less liquid assets. Furthermore, we obtain term secured funding liabilities in excess of less liquid inventory as an additional risk mitigant to replace maturing trades in the event that secured financing markets, or our ability to access them, become limited. As a component of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework, we hold a portion of our GLR against the potential disruption to our secured financing capabilities.
We generally maintain a pool of liquid and easily fundable securities, which takes into account HQLA classifications consistent with LCR definitions, and other regulatory requirements, and provides a valuable future source of liquidity.

Unsecured Financing
We view deposits and borrowings as stable sources of funding for unencumbered securities and non-security assets. Our unsecured financings include borrowings and certificates of deposit carried at fair value, which are primarily composed of: instruments whose payments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index, a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a commodity, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures; and instruments with various interest-rate-related features, including step-ups, step-downs and zero coupons. When appropriate, we typically use derivative products to conduct asset and liability management and to make adjustments to our interest rate and borrowings risk profile (see Notes 5 and 12 to the financial statements).

Deposits are primarily sourced from our Wealth Management clients and are considered to have stable, low-cost funding characteristics. Total deposits increased in 2019, primarily driven by increases in preferred Savings and Time deposits. These were partially offset by a reduction in Brokerage sweep deposits due to net outflows into investment products and higher client tax payments.

Original maturity in the table is generally based on contractual final maturity. For borrowings with put options, remaining maturity represents the earliest put date.

Borrowings of $193 billion as of December 31, 2019 were relatively unchanged compared with $190 billion at December 31, 2018.
 
We believe that accessing debt investors through multiple distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the unsecured markets. In addition, the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments. Borrowings with original maturities greater than one year are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types.
The availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. We also engage in, and may continue to engage in, repurchases of our borrowings in the ordinary course of business.
For further information on Borrowings, see Note 12 to the financial statements.

Credit Ratings
We rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our daily operations. The cost and availability of financing generally are impacted by our credit ratings, among other things. In addition, our credit ratings can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as certain OTC derivative transactions. When determining credit ratings, rating agencies consider both company-specific and industry-wide factors. These include regulatory or legislative changes, the macroeconomic environment and perceived levels of support, among other things. See also "Risk Factors— Liquidity Risk."

Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments
In connection with certain OTC derivatives and other agreements where we are a liquidity provider to certain financing vehicles associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, we may be required to provide additional collateral, immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties or pledge additional collateral to certain clearing organizations in the event of a future credit rating downgrade irrespective of whether we are in a net asset or net liability position. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional information on OTC derivatives that contain such contingent features.
While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact it would have on our business and results of operations in future periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors, including, among other things, the magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative to peers, the rating assigned by the relevant agency pre-downgrade, individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we might take. The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is included in our Liquidity Stress Tests.
Capital Management
We view capital as an important source of financial strength and actively manage our consolidated capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines. In the future, we may expand or contract our capital base to address the changing needs of our businesses.

Regulatory Requirements
Regulatory Capital Framework
We are an FHC under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”), and are subject to the regulation and oversight of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for us, including “well-capitalized” standards, and evaluates our compliance with such capital requirements. Regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”). The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. For us to remain an FHC, we must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the Federal Reserve, and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the OCC. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, see Note 15 to the financial statements.

 
Regulatory Capital Requirements
We are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital, and TLAC ratios. For additional information on TLAC, see “Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements” herein.
Risk-Based Regulatory Capital. Minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2 capital). Capital standards require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios.
In addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements, we are subject to the following buffers:
•
A greater than 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer;
•
The Common Equity Tier 1 G-SIB capital surcharge, currently at 3%; and
•
Up to a 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 CCyB, currently set by U.S. banking agencies at zero.
In 2018, the requirement for each of these buffers was 75% of the fully phased-in 2019 requirement noted above. For a further discussion of the G-SIB capital surcharge, see “G-SIB Capital Surcharge” herein.
Risk-Weighted Assets. RWA reflects both our on- and off-balance sheet risk, as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following:
•
Credit risk: The failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to us;
•
Market risk: Adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and
•
Operational risk: Inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events (e.g., fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets).
Our risk-based capital ratios for purposes of determining regulatory compliance are the lower of the capital ratios computed under (i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk RWA (“Standardized Approach”) or (ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWA (“Advanced Approach”). The credit risk RWA calculations between the two approaches differ in that the Standardized Approach requires calculation of RWA using prescribed risk weights, whereas the Advanced Approach utilizes models to calculate exposure amounts and risk weights. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our

December 2019 Form 10-K

Management's Discussion and Analysis
mslogo.jpg

ratios for determining regulatory compliance are based on the Standardized Approach rules.
Leverage-Based Regulatory Capital. Minimum leverage-based capital requirements include a Tier 1 leverage ratio and an SLR. We are required to maintain a Tier 1 SLR of 5%, inclusive of an enhanced SLR capital buffer of at least 2%.

1.
Required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented. For 2018, the required regulatory capital ratios for risk-based capital are under the transitional rules. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.
2.
Adjusted average assets represents the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio and is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by disallowed goodwill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in our own capital instruments, certain deferred tax assets and other capital deductions.
3.
Supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of Adjusted average assets used in the Tier 1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, potential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures.

Regulatory VaR—VaR for regulatory capital requirements
1.
The RWA for each category reflects both on- and off-balance sheet exposures, where appropriate.
2.
Amounts reflect assets not in a defined category, non-material portfolios of exposures and unsettled transactions, as applicable.
Credit risk RWA increased in 2019 under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches primarily due to increased exposures in lending commitments, Derivatives and Investment securities, as well as an increase in Other credit risk driven by the Firm’s adoption of the Leases accounting update on January 1, 2019. RWA under the Standardized Approach also increased due to higher exposures for Securities financing transactions, while under the Advanced Approach, in Derivatives, increased exposure also led to increased RWA related to CVA.
Market risk RWA decreased in 2019 under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, primarily due to a decrease in Stressed VaR driven by reduced equity and interest rate risk, and a decrease in the Incremental risk charge, mainly as a result of the improved alignment of hedges and reduced exposures in credit products.

The decrease in operational risk RWA under the Advanced Approach in 2019 reflects a continued reduction in the magnitude and frequency of internal losses utilized in the operational risk capital model related to litigation.

G-SIB Capital Surcharge
We and other U.S. G-SIBs are subject to a risk-based capital surcharge. A G-SIB must calculate its G-SIB capital surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. The first method considers the G-SIB’s size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, complexity and substitutability, which is generally consistent with the methodology developed by the Basel Committee (“Method 1”). The second method uses similar inputs but replaces substitutability with the use of short-term wholesale funding (“Method 2”) and generally results in higher surcharges than the first method. The G-SIB capital surcharge must be satisfied using Common Equity Tier 1 capital and functions as an extension of the capital conservation buffer. As of December 31, 2019, our fully phased-in G-SIB surcharge is 3%. In 2018, the requirement was based on a phase-in amount of 75% of the applicable surcharge (see “Risk-Based Regulatory Capital” herein).

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements
The Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long-term debt (“LTD”) and clean holding company requirements for top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs (“covered BHCs”), including the Parent Company. These requirements are designed to ensure that covered BHCs will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC where an SPOE resolution strategy is used (see “Business—Supervision and Regulation—Financial Holding Company—Resolution and Recovery Planning” and “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk”).
These TLAC and eligible LTD requirements include various restrictions, such as requiring eligible LTD to: be issued by the covered BHC and be unsecured; have a maturity of one year or more from the date of issuance; and not contain certain embedded features, such as a principal or redemption amount subject to reduction based on the performance of an asset, entity or index, or a similar feature. In addition, the requirements provide permanent grandfathering for debt instruments issued prior to December 31, 2016 that would be eligible LTD but for having impermissible acceleration clauses or being governed by foreign law.
A covered BHC is also required to maintain minimum external TLAC equal to the greater of (i) 18% of total RWA or (ii) 7.5% of its total leverage exposure (the denominator of its SLR). In addition, covered BHCs must meet a separate external LTD
 
requirement equal to the greater of (i) total RWA multiplied by the sum of 6% plus the higher of the Method 1 or Method 2 G-SIB capital surcharge applicable to the Parent Company, or (ii) 4.5% of its total leverage exposure.

Required ratios are inclusive of applicable buffers. The final rule imposes TLAC buffer requirements on top of both the risk-based and leverage exposure-based external TLAC minimum requirements. The risk-based TLAC buffer is equal to the sum of 2.5%, the covered BHC's Method 1 G-SIB surcharge and the CCyB, if any, as a percentage of total RWA. The leverage exposure-based TLAC buffer is equal to 2% of the covered BHC's total leverage exposure. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.
2.
External TLAC consists of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital (each excluding any noncontrolling minority interests), as well as eligible LTD.
3.
Consists of TLAC-eligible LTD reduced by 50% for amounts of unpaid principal due to be paid in more than one year but less than two years from December 31, 2019.
Furthermore, under the clean holding company requirements of the final rule, a covered BHC is prohibited from incurring any external debt with an original maturity of less than one year or certain other liabilities, regardless of whether the liabilities are fully secured or otherwise senior to eligible LTD, or entering into certain other prohibited transactions. Certain other external liabilities, including those with certain embedded features noted above, are subject to a cap equal to 5% of the covered BHC’s outstanding external TLAC amount. We are in compliance with all relevant TLAC requirements as of December 31, 2019.
The Federal Reserve has proposed modifications to the enhanced SLR that would also make corresponding changes to the calibration of the TLAC leverage-based requirements, as well as certain other technical changes to the TLAC rule. For a further discussion of the enhanced SLR, see “Regulatory Developments—Proposed Modifications to the Enhanced SLR and to the SLR Applicable to Our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries” herein.

Capital Plans and Stress Tests
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large BHCs, including us, which form part of the Federal Reserve’s annual CCAR framework.
We must submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate annual stress tests designed by us and the Federal Reserve, so that the Federal

Reserve may assess our systems and processes that incorporate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy. As banks with less than $250 billion of total assets, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are not subject to company-run stress-test regulatory requirements.
The capital plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance or redemption of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution (i.e., payments of dividends or stock repurchases) and any similar action that the Federal Reserve determines could impact our consolidated capital. The capital plan must include a discussion of how we will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, including any requirements that may be phased in over the planning horizon, and how we will serve as a source of strength to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under supervisory stress scenarios. In addition, the Federal Reserve has issued guidance setting out its heightened expectations for capital planning practices at certain large financial institutions, including us.
The capital plan rule requires that large BHCs receive no objection from the Federal Reserve before making a capital distribution. In addition, even with a capital plan that has not been objected to, the BHC must seek the non-objection of the Federal Reserve before making a capital distribution if, among other reasons, the BHC would not meet its regulatory capital requirements after making the proposed capital distribution. A BHC’s ability to make capital distributions (other than scheduled payments on Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments) is also limited if its net capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in its capital plan.
We submitted our 2019 Capital Plan (“Capital Plan”) and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve on April 5, 2019. On June 21, 2019, the Federal Reserve published summary results of the Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests of each large BHC, including us. On June 27, 2019, the Federal Reserve published summary results of CCAR and announced it did not object to our 2019 Capital Plan. Our 2019 Capital Plan includes the repurchase of up to $6.0 billion of outstanding common stock for the period beginning July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, and an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.35 per share from $0.30 per share, beginning with the common stock dividend announced on July 18, 2019. We disclosed a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests on June 21, 2019 on our Investor Relations webpage. In addition, we submitted the results of our mid-cycle company-run stress test to the Federal Reserve and on October 28, 2019 disclosed a summary of the results on our Investor Relations webpage.
For the 2020 capital planning and stress test cycle, we are required to submit our capital plan and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2020. The Federal Reserve is expected to publish summary results of the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests of each large BHC,
 
including us, by June 30, 2020. We are required to disclose a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests within 15 days of the date the Federal Reserve discloses the results of the supervisory stress tests.

Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework
Our required capital (“Required Capital”) estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated under the Required Capital framework, as well as each business segment’s relative contribution to our total Required Capital.
The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage use-of-capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. The amount of capital allocated to the business segments is generally set at the beginning of each year and remains fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset unless a significant business change occurs (e.g., acquisition or disposition). We define the difference between our total average common equity and the sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as Parent common equity. We generally hold Parent common equity for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth, acquisitions and other capital needs.
The Required Capital framework is expected to evolve over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment, for example, to incorporate changes in stress testing or enhancements to modeling techniques. We will continue to evaluate the framework with respect to the impact of future regulatory requirements, as appropriate.

Resolution and Recovery Planning
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure. We submitted our 2019 resolution plan on June 28, 2019.
Our preferred resolution strategy is an SPOE strategy. In line with our SPOE strategy, the Parent Company has transferred, and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis, certain assets to its wholly owned, direct subsidiary Morgan Stanley Holdings LLC (the “Funding IHC”). In addition, the Parent Company has entered into an amended and restated support agreement with its material entities (including the Funding IHC) and certain other subsidiaries. In the event of a resolution scenario, the Parent Company would be obligated to contribute all of its Contributable Assets to the material entities and/or the Funding IHC. The Funding IHC would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to the material entities.
The obligations of the Parent Company and the Funding IHC under the amended and restated support agreement are in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company and certain other assets), and the assets of the Funding IHC. As a result, claims of our material entities, including the Funding IHC, with respect to the secured assets, are effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the Parent Company.
In December 2019, we received joint feedback on our 2019 resolution plan from the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. The feedback confirmed that there are no deficiencies in our 2019 resolution plan and that we had successfully addressed a prior shortcoming identified by the agencies in the review of our 2017 resolution plan. The agencies noted one shortcoming in our 2019 resolution plan related to certain mechanisms intended to facilitate our SPOE strategy which must be addressed prior to our next resolution plan submission in 2021.
For more information about resolution and recovery planning requirements and our activities in these areas, including the implications of such activities in a resolution scenario, see “Business—Supervision and Regulation—Financial Holding Company—Resolution and Recovery Planning” and “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk.”
 
 
Regulatory Developments

Proposed Rule to Amend the Covered Fund Provisions of the Volcker Rule
The Federal financial regulatory agencies responsible for the Volcker Rule’s implementing regulations have proposed a rule that would revise the prohibition on certain investments by banking entities with defined covered funds. The proposed rule would add certain new exclusions from the definition of covered fund, while streamlining others. It would also simplify certain restrictions on inter-affiliate relationships with covered funds.

Final Rule on Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk

The U.S. banking agencies have issued a final rule to incorporate the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (“SA-CCR”), a new derivatives counterparty exposure methodology, into the regulatory capital framework and related regulatory standards. SA-CCR replaces the current exposure method, on a mandatory basis, in our and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries’ Standardized Approach RWA, Supplementary Leverage Ratio exposure calculations, and in all central counterparty default fund contribution calculations in the regulatory capital framework. SA-CCR is available as an alternative in our and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries’ Advanced Approach RWA for trade exposures, in single counterparty credit limits applicable to us, and in bank lending limits applicable to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. The final rule requires us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to implement SA-CCR by January 1, 2022, with early adoption permitted.

Proposed Revisions to the Regulatory Capital Treatment for Investments in Certain Unsecured Debt Instruments Issued by G-SIBs
The Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have issued a proposed rule that would, among other things, modify the regulatory capital framework for Advanced Approach banking organizations, including us. Such firms would be required to make certain deductions from regulatory capital for their investments in certain unsecured debt instruments (including eligible LTD in the TLAC framework) issued by the Parent Company and other G-SIBs.

Proposed Stress Buffer Requirements
The Federal Reserve issued a proposal in 2018 to integrate its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with existing applicable regulatory capital requirements. The proposal, which would apply to certain BHCs, including us, would introduce a stress capital buffer and a stress leverage buffer (collectively, “Stress Buffer Requirements”) and related changes to the capital planning and stress testing processes. Under the proposal, Stress Buffer Requirements would apply only with respect to Standardized Approach risk-based capital

requirements and Tier 1 leverage regulatory capital requirements.
Under Standardized Approach risk-based capital requirements, the stress capital buffer would replace the existing Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer, which is 2.5%. The Standardized Approach stress capital buffer would equal the greater of (i) the maximum decline in our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario over the supervisory stress test measurement period plus the sum of the ratios of the dollar amount of our planned common stock dividends to our projected RWA for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the supervisory stress test projection period or (ii) 2.5%. Regulatory capital requirements under the Standardized Approach would include the stress capital buffer, as summarized above, as well as our Common Equity Tier 1 G-SIB capital surcharge and any applicable Common Equity Tier 1 CCyB.
Like the stress capital buffer, the stress leverage buffer would be calculated based on the results of our annual supervisory stress tests. The stress leverage buffer would equal the maximum decline in our Tier 1 leverage ratio under the severely adverse scenario, plus the sum of the ratios of the dollar amount of our planned common stock dividends to our projected leverage ratio denominator for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the supervisory stress test projection period. No floor would be established for the stress leverage buffer, which would apply in addition to the current minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.
The proposal would make related changes to capital planning and stress testing processes for BHCs subject to the Stress Buffer Requirements. In particular, for purposes of determining the size of Stress Buffer Requirements, the proposal would include only projected capital actions to planned common stock dividends in the fourth through seventh quarters of the stress test projection period and would assume that BHCs maintain a constant level of assets and RWA throughout the supervisory stress test projection period.
The proposal does not change regulatory capital requirements under the Advanced Approach or the SLR, although the Federal Reserve and the OCC have separately proposed to modify the enhanced SLR requirements, as summarized below. If the proposal is adopted in its current form, limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers would be determined by the most stringent limitation, if any, as determined under Standardized Approach risk-based capital requirements or the Tier 1 leverage ratio, inclusive of Stress Buffer Requirements, or the Advanced Approach or SLR or TLAC requirements, inclusive of applicable buffers.
The Federal Reserve has not yet taken action to finalize or implement Stress Buffer Requirements.
 
Proposed Modifications to the Enhanced SLR and to the SLR Applicable to Our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries
The Federal Reserve has proposed modifications to the enhanced SLR that would replace the current 2% enhanced SLR buffer applicable to U.S. G-SIBs, including us, with a leverage buffer equal to 50% of our G-SIB capital surcharge.
Under the proposal, our enhanced SLR buffer would become 1.5%, for a total enhanced SLR requirement of 4.5%, assuming that our current G-SIB capital surcharge remains the same when the proposal becomes effective.
The Federal Reserve and the OCC have also proposed to modify the well-capitalized SLR standard applicable to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. The requirement would change from the current 6% to 3% plus 50% of our current G-SIB capital surcharge, for a total well-capitalized SLR requirement of 4.5% for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, assuming that our G-SIB capital surcharge remains the same when the proposal becomes effective.
Other Matters

U.K. Withdrawal from the E.U.
On January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew from the E.U. under the terms of a withdrawal agreement between the U.K. and the E.U. The withdrawal agreement provides for a transition period to the end of December 2020, during which time the U.K. will continue to apply E.U. law as if it were a member state, and U.K. firms’ rights to provide financial services in E.U. member states will continue. Access to the E.U. market after the transition period remains subject to negotiation.
We have prepared the structure of our European operations for a range of potential outcomes, including for the possibility that U.K. financial firms’ access to E.U. markets after the transition period is limited, and we expect to be able to continue to serve our clients and customers under each of these potential outcomes.
For more information on the U.K.’s withdrawal from the E.U., our related preparations and the potential impact on our operations, see “Risk Factors—International Risk.” For further information regarding our exposure to the U.K., see also “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Country and Other Risks.”

Planned Replacement of London Interbank Offered Rate and Replacement or Reform of Other Interest Rates
Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned committees and working groups of market participants and official sector representatives to replace LIBOR and replace or reform other interest rate benchmarks (collectively, the “IBORs”).
Accordingly, we have established and are undertaking a Firmwide IBOR transition plan to promote the transition to alternative reference rates, which takes into account the considerable uncertainty regarding the availability of LIBOR beyond 2021. Our transition plan includes a number of key steps, including continued engagement with central bank and industry working groups and regulators (including participation and leadership on key committees), active client engagement, internal operational readiness, and risk management, among other things.  Our transition plan is overseen by a global steering committee, with senior management oversight. As part of our Firmwide initiative, we are identifying, assessing and monitoring risks associated with the expected discontinuation or unavailability of one or more of the IBORs.
We are a party to a significant number of IBOR-linked contracts, many of which extend beyond 2021, comprising derivatives, securitizations and floating rate notes, loans and mortgages. Our review of these contracts includes assessing the impact of applicable fallbacks and any amendments that may be warranted or appropriate. We are also taking steps to update operational processes (including to support alternative reference rates), models, and associated infrastructure, as well as planning for certain client outreach to amend fallbacks or seek voluntary conversions of outstanding IBOR products where practicable.
In addition, as part of the transition to alternative reference rates, we are making markets in products linked to such rates, including SOFR, the alternative rate to U.S. dollar LIBOR selected by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and also began issuing debt linked to SOFR.
For a further discussion of the expected replacement of the IBORs and/or reform of interest rate benchmarks, and the related risks and our transition plan, see “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk.”
