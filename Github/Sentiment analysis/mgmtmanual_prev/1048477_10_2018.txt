Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the disclosures under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ significantly from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report or implied by past results and trends. Forward-looking statements are statements that attempt to forecast or anticipate future developments in our business, financial condition or results of operations. See the section titled “Forward-Looking Statements” that appears at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (unless another date is indicated), and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements in light of future developments. Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are presented in U.S. dollars (USD).

Overview

We are a global biotechnology company that develops and commercializes innovative therapies for people with serious and life-threatening rare diseases and medical conditions. We select product candidates for diseases and conditions that represent a significant unmet medical need, have well-understood biology and provide an opportunity to be first-to-market or offer a significant benefit over existing products.

Our therapy portfolio consists of six commercial products and multiple clinical and pre-clinical product candidates. Our commercial products are Aldurazyme (laronidase) for Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I), Brineura (cerliponase alfa) for the treatment of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), Firdapse (amifampridine phosphate) for Lambert Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), Kuvan (sapropterin dihydrochloride) for phenylketonuria (PKU), Naglazyme (galsulfase) for Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI) and Vimizim (elosulfase alpha) for Mucopolysaccharidosis IV Type A (MPS IV A).

Business Developments

We continued to grow our commercial business and advance our product candidate pipeline during 2017. We believe that the combination of our internal research programs, acquisitions and partnerships will allow us to continue to develop and commercialize innovative therapies for people with serious and life-threatening rare diseases and medical conditions. Below is a summary of key business developments in 2017:

Product Approvals

 

•

Brineura was approved to treat children with CLN2 disease by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2017 and by the European Commission (EC) in June 2017. We began marketing Brineura in the U.S. and EU following approval in each of these markets.

Continued Emphasis on Research and Development

 

•

The FDA completed its review of the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for valoctocogene roxaparvovec (formerly referred to as BMN 270), an investigational gene therapy treatment for severe hemophilia A, concluded that we could proceed with its clinical development, and granted valoctocogene roxaparvovec Breakthrough Therapy Designation in October 2017. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted its Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation to valoctocogene roxaparvovec. We initiated the first of two global Phase 3 program in the fourth quarter of 2017. In early 2018, we plan to enroll the first patient in the second global Phase 3 program and will begin another Phase 1/2 Study with the 6e13kg/vg dose.

 

•

We selected our next product development candidate, BMN 290, a selective chromatin modulation therapy intended for treatment of Friedreich's ataxia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder that results in disabling neurologic and cardiac progressive decline. We expect to submit IND application in the second half of 2018.

 

•

The FDA accepted for Priority Review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for pegvaliase, a PEGylated phenylanine-metabolizing enzyme product, to reduce blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adult patients with PKU who have uncontrolled blood Phe levels on existing management. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date has been extended by three months to

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – (Continued)

 

 

May 28, 2018, which was changed to May 25, 2018 due to the Memorial Day holiday. We intend to submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the EMA in the first quarter of 2018.

 

•

We continued our ongoing trials for vosoritide for the treatment of children with achondroplasia, including a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of vosoritide in approximately 110 children with achondroplasia 52 weeks and a long-term open-label Phase 2 study of approximately 23 children. In 2018, we expect to initiate an infant/toddler study and continue the natural history program to augment existing studies.

 

•

We announced positive, preliminary results from a multicenter, international Phase 1/2 clinical trial for BMN 250, which began enrolling patients in April 2016. The study demonstrated that BMN 250 reduced heparan sulfate levels to normal range in cerebral spinal fluid of MPS IIIB patients and indicated that ICV-administered BMN 250 is well-tolerated by MPS IIIB patients. A complementary observational study was also initiated to study the progression of MPS IIIB over time.

Other 2017 Developments

 

•

We executed a license agreement and a settlement agreement (the Sarepta Agreements) with Sarepta Therapeutics (Sarepta) that provide Sarepta with global exclusive rights to our Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patent estate for EXONDYS 51 and all future exon-skipping products. The Sarepta Agreements resolved the ongoing worldwide patent proceedings related to the use of EXONDYS 51 and all future exon-skipping products for the treatment of DMD. See Note 21 to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

 

•

We commissioned our commercial gene therapy manufacturing facility, located in Novato, California, and began current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) production of valoctocogene roxaparvovec to support clinical development activities and anticipated commercial demand.

 

•

We entered into a settlement agreement with Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc. and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Ltd. (collectively, DRL) that resolves the patent litigation with DRL in the U.S. related to Kuvan 100 mg oral powder. Please see “Legal Proceedings” included in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information.

 

•

We entered into a settlement agreement with Par Pharmaceutical (Par) that resolves patent litigation in the U.S. with Par related to our Kuvan (sapropterin dihydrochloride) 100 mg oral tablets and oral powder in 100 mg and 500 mg packet formulations. Please see “Legal Proceedings” included in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information.

 

•

We issued $495.0 million in aggregate principal of 0.599% senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2024 (the 2024 Notes), which resulted in net proceeds of $481.7 million.

Outlook 2018

In 2018, we will continue to focus on our key operating objectives which include continued progression of our product pipeline and continued uptake of our commercial products. From a research and development (R&D) perspective, we expect to continue to invest in our various ongoing clinical studies, which support both our commercial products and pipeline of new product candidates. We expect to move forward on a number of late-stage clinical studies for new product candidates and plan to file marketing applications for various therapeutic areas.

From a commercial perspective, we expect to continue to build-out our commercial organization to support the commercialization of Brineura and Vimizim and the international expansion of Kuvan.

We continue to monitor conditions in the macroeconomic environment that could affect our ability to achieve our goals, such as changes in the reimbursement and payer landscape, a worsening of economic conditions in certain key markets, particularly in Europe, patent expirations of competitive products and the launch of generic competitors, government pricing pressures internationally and the potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We will adjust our business processes, as appropriate, to attempt to mitigate these risks to our business.

We expect that our product pipeline investments and expanding commercial infrastructure will enable us to execute on our 2018 operating objectives.

See “Results of Operations” below for a discussion of the detailed components and analysis of the amounts noted above.

Total Revenues include net product revenues and royalty and other revenues. Net Product Revenues include revenues generated from our approved products. In the U.S., our commercial products are generally sold to specialty pharmacies or end-users, such as hospitals, which act as retailers. Outside the U.S., our commercial products are sold to our authorized distributors or directly to government purchasers or hospitals, which act as the end-users. Royalty and Other Revenues include royalties on net sales of products to licensees or sublicensees, collaborative agreement revenues and rental income associated with the tenants in our San Rafael, California facility.

Our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2017, compared to $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2016. We have historically financed our operations primarily through our cash flows from operating activities and the issuance of common stock and convertible debt. We will be highly dependent on our net product revenues to supplement our current liquidity and fund our operations for the foreseeable future. We may in the future elect to supplement this with further debt or equity offerings or commercial borrowing. Further, depending on market conditions, our financial position and performance and other factors, we may in the future choose to use a portion of our cash, cash equivalents or investments to repurchase our convertible debt or other securities. See “Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for a further discussion of our liquidity and capital resources.

Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments

In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP in the U.S. and pursuant to the rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our net income/loss and affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:

 

•

Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances;

 

•

Inventory;

 

•

Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets;

 

•

Valuation of Contingent Acquisition Consideration Payable; and  

 

•

Income Taxes.

Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.

Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances

Net Product Revenues— We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collection from the customer is reasonably assured. We record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, and other related charges. These are generally referred to as gross to net deductions and are recorded in the same period the related sales occur. Rebates, distributor fees and cash discounts represent the majority of our gross to net deduction and require complete and significant judgment by management. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information.

Revenue Related Allowances – Our revenue related allowances include rebates, distributor fees and cash discounts. Rebates include amounts paid to Medicaid, other government programs, certain managed care providers, as well as foreign government rebates. Rebates, distributor fees and cash discounts are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which may vary by product and payer.  

Our allowance for government and other rebates is estimated based on products sold, customer mix, and program requirements. We evaluate our customer mix to estimate which sales will be subject to rebates and consider changes to government program guidelines that would impact the actual rebates and/or our estimates of which sales qualify for such rebates. We update our estimates and assumptions each quarter based on actual historical experience and record any necessary adjustments to our reserves. We record fees paid to distributors and cash discounts as a reduction of revenue based on contractual terms and product sold.

We believe the methodologies that we use to estimate allowances are reasonable and appropriate given the facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates.

Inventory  

When future commercialization for a product candidate is probable and management expects to realize economic benefit in the future, we capitalize pre-launch inventory costs prior to regulatory approval. For inventories that are capitalized in preparation of product launch, management considers a number of factors, including the product candidate’s current status in the regulatory approval process, results from the related pivotal clinical trial, results from meetings with relevant regulatory agencies prior to the filing of regulatory applications, historical experience, as well as potential impediments to the approval process such as product safety or efficacy, commercialization and market trends.

60

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – (Continued)

 

In applying the lower of cost or net realizable value to pre-launch inventory, we estimate a range of likely commercial prices based on our comparable commercial products and consider the product candidate’s stability data for all of the pre-approval production to date to determine whether there is adequate expected shelf life for the capitalized pre-launch production costs.

Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets

We have recorded goodwill and acquired intangible assets primarily related to in-process research and development (IPR&D) projects through acquisitions accounted for as business combinations. When identifiable intangible assets, including IPR&D, are acquired, we determine the fair value of these assets as of the acquisition date. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations if quoted market prices are not available, and the models require significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:

 

•

estimating future cash flows from product sales;

 

•

estimating the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidate;

 

•

developing appropriate probability of success rates for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development;

 

•

projecting timing of regulatory approval; and

 

•

risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting and is not amortized, but subject to impairment testing. We review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying about may not be recoverable. We perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived assets to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit or other indefinite live assets is less than its carrying value. If it is determined that the fair value is more likely than not less than its carrying value, we will perform the two step impairment test. In the first step of the impairment review, we compare the carrying value of our single reporting unit or applicable asset to its fair value, which management estimates using a discounted cash flow analysis. If the carrying value of our single reporting unit or asset exceeds its fair value, we perform the second step, and determine the impairment loss, if any, as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset over its fair value.  

Valuation of Contingent Acquisition Consideration Payable

Significant estimates and judgements are required in determining the acquisition fair value of any contingent obligations incurred in connection with an acquisition. We estimate the fair value of contingent acquisition consideration payments utilizing a probability-based income approach inclusive of an estimated discount rate. Each period we reassess the fair value of the contingent acquisition consideration payable associated with certain acquisitions and record increases in the fair value as contingent consideration expense and record decreases in the fair value as a reduction of contingent consideration expense. Changes in the fair value of the contingent acquisition consideration payable can result from changes to one or multiple inputs including the estimated probability with respect to regulatory approval, changes in the assumed timing of when milestones are likely to be achieved and changes in assumed discount periods and rates. Accordingly, subsequent changes in the underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes to our estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of contingent acquisition consideration payable.

We believe the fair value used to record contingent acquisition consideration payable incurred in connection with a business combinations is based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation date.

Income Taxes

 

We calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect net deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are measured using enacted tax

61

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – (Continued)

 

rates. The net deferred tax assets primarily represent the tax benefit of tax credits and timing differences between book and tax recognition of certain revenue and expense items, net of a valuation allowance. When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance for the amount that may not be realized. We establish liabilities or reduce assets for certain tax position when we believe certain tax position are not more likely than not to be sustained if challenged. Each quarter, we evaluate these uncertain tax position and adjust the related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances.

 

We utilize financial projections to support our net deferred tax assets, which contain significant assumptions and estimates of future operations. If such assumptions were to differ significantly, it may have a material impact on our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. We assess our ability to realize our deferred tax benefits at the end of each period, If we determine it is more likely than not that we will not realize the deferred tax benefits, valuation allowance may need to be established against all or a portion of our deferred tax assets. Changes in our valuation allowance will result in a change to tax expense.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions including Ireland. Due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. We cannot predict the form or timing of potential legislative changes that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Management is not aware of any potential changes that would have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, except for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act), which was enacted in December 2017. We have estimated the impact of the 2017 Tax Act by incorporating assumptions made based upon our current interpretation and analysis to date of the law. The actual impact of the 2017 Tax Act may differ from our estimates due to, among other things, further refinement of our calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the new legislation.

The decrease in Net Loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributed to the following:

 

•

an increase in Total Revenues driven by new patients initiating therapy and the $31.5 million net upfront license payment from Sarepta pursuant to the Sarepta Agreements;

•

the $125.0 million gain on the sale of the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (the PRV) that we received in connection with the approval from the FDA of Brineura for the treatment of CLN2; and

 

•

the absence of the $599.1 million intangible asset impairment charge recorded in 2016 when the Kyndrisa and reveglucosidase alfa programs were terminated; partially offset by

 

•

the increase in the provision for income taxes and a $5.8 million IPR&D asset impairment charge due to the termination of related development programs.  

See below for additional information related to the Net Loss fluctuations presented above, including details of our operating expense fluctuations and the aforementioned impairment charge.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – (Continued)

 

Our Brineura, Firdapse, Kuvan, Naglazyme and Vimizim customers include a limited number of specialty pharmacies and end-users, such as hospitals and foreign government agencies. We also sell Brineura, Kuvan, Naglazyme and Vimizim to our authorized distributors and to certain larger pharmaceutical wholesalers globally, which act as intermediaries between us and end-users and generally do not stock significant quantities of our products. However, in certain countries, such as in Latin America, governments place large periodic orders for Naglazyme and Vimizim. The timing of these large government orders can be inconsistent and can create significant quarter to quarter variation in our revenues. Genzyme Corporation (Genzyme) is our sole customer for Aldurazyme and is responsible for marketing and selling Aldurazyme to third parties.

The following is additional discussion of our revenues by product:

 

•

Aldurazyme: The decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 and the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily attributable to the decreases in shipments to Genzyme, offset in part by the increase in Aldurazyme revenue reported by Genzyme. Aldurazyme revenues reported by Genzyme totaled $233.8 million, $223.3 million and $217.8 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Although Genzyme sells Aldurazyme worldwide, the net product revenues earned by us on Genzyme’s net sales are denominated in USD. We will adopt Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended, (commonly referred to as ASC Topic 606) on January 1, 2018. After adopting ASC Topic 606, we will recognize Aldurazyme revenues when the product is shipped to Genzyme and all required quality control certificates are complete, because our performance obligations are fulfilled at that point in time. We will record Aldurazyme net product revenues based on the estimated tiered payment that will be in effect when the product is sold through by Genzyme. We believe any differences between the estimated revenue from Genzyme and actual payments will be insignificant. See Note 4 to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the impact of ASC Topic 606 on the first quarter of 2018.

 

•

Brineura: The FDA and EC granted marketing approval for Brineura in April 2017 and June 2017, respectively. We began marking the product following approval in each of these markets with the first commercial shipments in the U.S. and EU occurring in June 2017 and July 2017, respectively.

 

•

Kuvan: The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in patients on Kuvan therapy in the U.S. and the completion of the transition of the ex-North American territories acquired in 2016. The increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to the addition of international Kuvan product sales through the acquisition of certain rights and other assets with respect to Kuvan and pegvaliase from Merck Serono and its affiliates (the Merck PKU Business) in January 2016 and new patients initiating therapy in the U.S. Prior to our acquisition of the Merck PKU Business, we earned royalties of 4% on Merck Serono’s net sales of Kuvan.

Two companies previously filed paragraph IV certifications and submitted abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) to produce sapropterin dihydrochloride tablets and powder. We entered into settlement agreements regarding Kuvan with both companies. Please see “Government Regulation – Hatch-Waxman Act” below and “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Please see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks posed by generic versions of Kuvan.  

 

•

Naglazyme: The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to new patients initiating therapy, the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the timing of central government orders from Latin America and Europe. The decrease in Naglazyme net product revenues for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to the timing of central government orders from Latin America and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by new patients initiating therapy in Europe and the Middle East.

 

•

Vimizim: The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 and in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to new patients initiating therapy.

We face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro. We use foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure.

The net impact of foreign currency exchange rates on product sales denominated in currencies other than USD during 2017 was positive by $5.5 million, compared to a negative impact of $3.6 million during 2016 and a negative impact of $37.3 million during 2015. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on currency exchange rate risk related to our revenues.

Royalty and Other Revenues

Royalty and Other Revenues were $43.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $6.5 million and $5.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to recognition of the $31.5 million net upfront license revenue from Sarepta and $3.8 million in royalty revenue earned on Sarepta net sales during 2017. We expect to continue earn royalties from Sarepta’s net sales under the terms of the Sarepta Agreements in future quarters.

Cost of Sales and Product Gross Margin

Cost of Sales includes raw materials, personnel and facility and other costs associated primarily with manufacturing Aldurazyme, Brineura, Naglazyme and Vimizim at our production facilities. Cost of Sales also includes third-party manufacturing costs for the production of the active ingredient in Kuvan and Firdapse and third-party production costs related to final formulation and packaging services for all products and cost of royalties payable to third parties for all products

Our product gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 remained flat compared to 2016, which decreased from 2015 primarily due to increased Naglazyme and Vimizim manufacturing costs. We expect product gross margin to remain near 80 percent over the next twelve months.

Research and Development

R&D Expense includes costs associated with the research and development of product candidates and post-marketing research commitments related to our approved products. R&D Expense primarily includes preclinical and clinical studies, personnel and raw materials costs associated with manufacturing product candidates, quality control and assurance, research and development, facilities and regulatory costs

We manage our R&D expense by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other similar considerations. We continually review our product pipeline and the development status of product candidates and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the research and development portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business.

R&D expense decreased to $610.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $661.9 million and $634.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. R&D expense consisted of the following (in millions):

The decrease in R&D expense primarily comprised the following:

 

•

a decrease in R&D expense for other and non-allocated programs primarily related to R&D spending in 2016 on the Kyndrisa, other exon-skipping, and reveglucosidase alfa development programs, all of which were terminated in 2016; and

 

•

a decrease in R&D expense related to Brineura, which was approved for marketing in the U.S. and EU in June 2017 and July 2017, respectively. During the second quarter of 2016, we evaluated the facts and circumstances supporting recoverability of pre-launch manufacturing costs related to Brineura and concluded that recoverability was probable, resulting in the decrease in R&D costs as pre-launch manufacturing costs began to be capitalized during 2016. Prior to the second quarter of 2016, Brineura pre-launch manufacturing costs incurred were expensed to R&D expense as significant uncertainty existed over the recoverability of the costs at the time; partially offset by

 

•

an increase in clinical trial activities related to BMN 250, pegvaliase and valoctocogene roxaparvovec product candidates; and

 

•

an increase in pre-clinical activity for our early stage programs.  

During 2018, we expect our R&D spending to increase over 2017 levels due to our BMN 250, BMN 290, pegvaliase, valoctocogene roxaparvovec, and vosoritide programs progressing in their development. We also expect increased spending on pre-clinical activities for our early development stage programs. Additionally, we expect to continue incurring R&D expense for the foreseeable future due to long-term clinical activities related to post-approval regulatory commitments for our approved products. We continuously evaluate the recoverability of costs associated with pre-launch or pre-qualification manufacturing activities, and if it is determined that recoverability is highly likely and therefore future revenues are expected, the costs subsequently incurred related to pre-launch or pre-qualification manufacturing activities for purposes of commercial sales will likely be capitalized. When regulatory approval and the likelihood of future revenues for a product candidate are less certain, the related manufacturing costs are expensed as R&D expenses.

2016 compared to 2015

The increase in R&D expense primarily comprised the following:

 

•

an increase in R&D expense related to Brineura, pegvaliase, and vosoritide due to increased clinical trial activities related to these product candidates as they advanced to later stages of development;

 

•

an increase in R&D expense related to BMN 250 and valoctocogene roxaparvovec due to increased pre-clinical and clinical activities related to these product candidates; and

 

•

an increase in R&D expense related to vosoritide and valoctocogene roxaparvovec due to payments totaling $12.0 million related to achievement of certain development milestones; partially offset by

 

•

a decrease in R&D expense for other and non-allocated programs primarily related to talazoparib due to the completion of the sale of the assets to Medivation, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2015.  

Selling, General and Administrative

Sales and Marketing (S&M) expense primarily consisted of employee-related expenses for our sales group, brand marketing, patient support groups and pre-commercialization expenses related to our product candidates. General and administrative (G&A) expense primarily consisted of corporate support and other administrative expenses, including employee-related expenses.

SG&A expense increased to $554.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $476.6 million and $402.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. SG&A expenses consisted of the following (in millions):

The increase in S&M expense primarily comprised the following:

 

•

an increase in Kuvan and Vimizim S&M expense due to continued worldwide expansion of commercial activities; and

 

•

an increase in Brineura S&M expense primarily due to marketing expense related to the commercial launch of Brineura in 2017; partially offset by

 

•

a decrease in other and not allocated S&M expense primarily due to the decrease in S&M expenses related to Kyndrisa and other terminated programs.

The increase in G&A expense was primarily due to increased personnel-related costs mainly due to increased headcount.

We expect SG&A expense to increase in future periods as a result of the continued commercial launch of Brineura, pre-commercialization efforts related to product candidates, the continued international expansion of Kuvan and Vimizim, and the increase in administrative support required for our expanding operations.

2016 compared to 2015

The increase in S&M expense primarily comprised the following:

 

•

an increase in Kuvan S&M expense due to expansion of worldwide commercial activities as a result of acquiring the worldwide rights to Kuvan, except for Japan, from Merck Serono on January 1, 2016;

 

•

an increase in Naglazyme and Vimizim S&M expense due to continued expansion of our worldwide commercial activities; and

 

•

an increase in Brineura S&M expense due to an increase in pre-commercialization marketing expense for Brineura.

G&A expense increased in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to increased headcount, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.

Intangible Asset Amortization and Contingent Consideration

Changes in the fair value of contingent acquisition consideration payable result from updates to the estimated probability of achievement or assumed timing of milestones and adjustments to the discount periods and rates. Intangible asset amortization and contingent consideration expense consisted of the following (in millions):

The changes in the fair value of the contingent acquisition consideration payable were primarily attributable to changes in the estimated probability of achieving development milestones based on the current status of the related development programs as well as the passage of time. The majority of the changes in fair value of contingent acquisition consideration payable for each period presented was attributed to the following:

 

•

the continued progress of the PKU developmental program for pegvaliase; and

 

•

the progress of the talazoparib program currently being developed by Pfizer, Inc.; partially offset by

 

•

the reversal of the fair value of the Firdapse FDA approval milestone due to the reduction of the estimated probability of achieving the Firdapse FDA approval milestone prior to its expiration date; and

 

•

the termination of the Kyndrisa and reveglucosidase alfa development programs in 2016 resulted in the reversal of the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration payable to the former Prosensa Holding N.V. and Zystor Therapeutics, Inc. shareholders, respectively.  

The increase in amortization of intangible assets during 2017 was primarily attributable to the impairment of IPR&D assets we acquired from Zacharon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as the related development programs were terminated. It is our policy to report impairment charges that are not material as a component of Intangible Asset Amortization and Contingent Consideration on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

2016 compared to 2015

The majority of the changes in fair value of contingent acquisition consideration payable for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributed to the discontinuance of the Kyndrisa and reveglucosidase alfa development programs, which resulted in the reversal of the fair value of the

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – (Continued)

 

remaining contingent consideration payable to the former Prosensa and ZyStor Therapeutics, Inc. shareholders, respectively, because the related sales milestones were no longer expected to be attained.

The increase in amortization of intangible assets during 2016 was primarily attributable to the amortization of the Kuvan intangible assets acquired from Merck Serono in January 2016.

Impairment of Intangible Asset

No material impairment charges were recorded in 2017. In 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $599.1 million related to the Kyndrisa and other exon and reveglucosidase alfa IPR&D assets based on the termination of the internal development of the respective programs. In 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of $198.7 million related to the Kyndrisa IPR&D assets based on the then current status of our U.S. development efforts and the related discounted cash flows that no longer supported the full carrying-value of the Kyndrisa IPR&D assets. See Note 7 to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our Intangible Assets.

Gain on Sale of Intangible Asset

In December 2017, we sold the PRV that we received in connection with the FDA approval of Brineura for the treatment of CLN2. In exchange for the PRV, we received lump sum payment of $125.0 million from Novartis Pharma AG. The proceeds from the sale of PRV were recognized as a gain on the sale of intangible asset. In 2015, we recognized a net gain of $369.5 million for the sale of talazoparib to Medivation, Inc.

Interest Income

We invest our cash, short-term and long-term investments in U.S. government securities and other high credit quality debt securities in order to limit default and market risk. Interest income was $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.5 million and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in interest income during 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher investment balances, which increased due to the investment of the net proceeds of $481.7 million from our August 2017 issuance of the 2024 Notes and higher average interest rate on investments. Due to higher investment balances offset in part by planned spend, during 2018 we expect an increase in interest income from present levels.

Interest Expense

We incur interest expense on our convertible debt. Interest expense consisted of the following (in millions):

The increased interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the August 2017 issuance of the 2024 Notes. The increased interest expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was attributable to an increase in the accretion of the discount on our 0.75% senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2018 (the 2018 Notes) and our 1.50% senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2020 (the 2020 Notes and, together with the 2018 Notes and the 2024 Notes, the Notes) which were issued in October 2013, using the effective interest rate method. We expect interest expense to increase over the next 12 months due to the coupon interest and amortization of issuance costs related to the 2024 Notes. See Note 13 to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt.

Other Expense

During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded write-offs of $12.8 million for investments and advances related to a supplier of one of our multi-sourced materials due to a deterioration in its financial condition.

Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes

On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. The new law has resulted in significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. These changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21% and the elimination or reduction of certain domestic deductions and credits, including a 50% reduction in the orphan drug credit benefit. The 2017 Tax Act changed U.S. international taxation from a worldwide basis to a modified territorial system that includes base erosion prevention measures on foreign earnings. This will result in our foreign subsidiaries being subject to U.S. taxation in the future. These changes are effective in 2018.

We recognized an income tax provision of $81.2 million, an income tax benefit of $200.8 million and an income tax provision of $17.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Changes to tax laws and tax rates are required to be accounted for in the period of the enactment, therefore our 2017 tax provision included the impact of the 2017 Tax Act. Provision for (benefit from) income taxes for 2017, 2016 and 2015 consisted of state, federal and foreign current tax expense which was offset by tax benefits related to stock option exercises and deferred tax benefits from federal orphan drug credits, federal R&D credits and California R&D credits. The provision for (benefit from) income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were further impacted by the following items:

 

•

2017 included a provisional expense of $42.3 million related to the 2017 Tax Act primarily consisting of $33.1 million for the re-measurement of the net deferred tax assets at the lower enacted corporate tax rate and $9.2 million related to the new limitations on tax deductible compensation. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when these temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. Additionally, we established a $41.4 million valuation allowance on state tax credits as management assessed the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on our financial projections and concluded that it is more likely than not that these state tax credits will not be utilized in the foreseeable future because these credits do not expire and we project that we will be generating more credits than we will utilize on an annual basis. The 2017 Tax Act also includes a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation toll tax on accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that did not impact us due to a net deficit in these foreign subsidiaries;

 

•

2016 included a deferred tax benefit of $143.5 million associated with the GAAP impairment of the Kyndrisa IPR&D; and

 

•

2015 included a deferred tax benefit of $49.7 million associated with the GAAP impairment of the Kyndrisa IPR&D, which was partially offset by a $29.7 million increase in the valuation allowance related to future contingent consideration on the sale of talazoparib that is reasonably uncertain of receipt.

The 2017 provisional charge is an estimate and the measurement of deferred tax assets is subject to further analysis and potential correlative adjustments as developing interpretations and guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard setting bodies provide additional clarifications of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act. Updated guidance and regulations could result in changes to this estimate during 2018 when the analysis is complete. We have not yet elected an accounting method regarding whether to record deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected amounts of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) inclusions or whether to treat such amounts as a period cost.  

The consolidated GAAP net loss includes all of our foreign subsidiaries. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” we calculate our provision for (benefit from) income taxes on an entity-by-entity and jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis as adjusted for differences between book-basis income and tax-basis income, which results in certain foreign entities being profitable and incurring foreign current income tax expense. Certain foreign entities incur significant amounts of R&D expense that results in significant losses that more than offset the income reported by the profitable foreign entities on a consolidated basis. The majority of these material R&D losses are in foreign jurisdictions that do not have net operating loss carryforward provisions that result in deferred tax assets, which results in an effective tax rate of 0% on approximately $53.5 million of foreign net losses during 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Dutch operations had GAAP income of $20.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, other foreign operations generated GAAP income of approximately $16.3 million with an effective tax rate of approximately 22%.

Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2017, we had $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments. We expect to fund our operations with our net product revenues from our commercial products, cash, cash equivalents and investments, supplemented as may become necessary by proceeds from equity or debt financings and loans, or collaborative agreements with corporate partners. We may require additional financing to fund the repayment of our convertible debt, future milestone payments and our future operations,

70

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – (Continued)

 

including the commercialization of our products and product candidates currently under development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, and potential licenses and acquisitions. We will need to raise additional funds from equity or debt securities, loans or collaborative agreements if we are unable to satisfy our liquidity requirements. The timing and mix of our funding options could change depending on many factors, including how much we elect to spend on our development programs, potential licenses and acquisitions of complementary technologies, products and companies or if we elect to settle all or a portion of our convertible debt in cash.

In managing our liquidity needs in the U.S., we do not rely on unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds and we have not provided for U.S. federal or state income taxes on these undistributed foreign earnings. We do not record U.S. tax expense on the undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries as these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. As of December 31, 2017, the cumulative amount of these earnings was approximately $10.7 million. 

As of December 31, 2017, $187.9 million of our $1.8 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments was held in foreign subsidiaries, a significant portion of which is required to fund the liquidity needs of these foreign subsidiaries. See Note 15 to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.

We are mindful that conditions in the current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals. We sell our products in countries that face economic volatility and weakness. Although we have historically collected receivables from customers in such countries, sustained weakness or further deterioration of the local economies and currencies may cause customers in those countries to be unable to pay for our products. We will continue to monitor these conditions and will attempt to adjust our business processes, as appropriate, to mitigate macroeconomic risks to our business.

Cash Used in Operating Activities

Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $8.8 million, compared to cash used in operating activities of $227.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash used in operating activities primarily consisted of net loss of $117.0 million, adjusted for non-cash items such as $140.3 million for stock-based compensation expenses, $87.9 million for depreciation and amortization expense, $44.5 million for a change in deferred income taxes and $32.3 million of non-cash interest expense, partially offset by a $125.0 million gain on the sale of an intangible asset. Changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net

71

cash outflow of $94.0 million that consisted primarily of increased cash outflow for increased inventory spending for all commercial products to meet anticipated future sales demand.

Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $227.8 million, compared to cash used in operating activities of $219.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash used in operating activities primarily consisted of net loss of $630.2 million, adjusted for non-cash items such as $599.1 million of asset impairment charges, $134.6 million for stock-based compensation expenses, $96.9 million for depreciation and amortization expense, and $29.9 million of non-cash interest expense, partially offset by $228.1 million change in deferred income taxes and $57.2 million related to the decrease in the fair value of contingent acquisition consideration payable. Changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net cash outflow of $160.3 million that consisted primarily of increased cash outflow for R&D expenses and increased inventory spending to meet anticipated future sales demand.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $305.5 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $484.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to the $125.0 million in proceeds from the sale of the PRV and an increase of $102.7 million in net purchases of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by a $50.8 million increase in the purchases of property, plant and equipment. We expect to continue to make significant capital investments in our manufacturing facilities and our corporate headquarters to accommodate anticipated headcount growth.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $484.0 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to the absence of 2015 payments of $538.4 million to acquire Prosensa and $371.8 million deposit for the PKU rights from Merck Serono, a $79.3 million decrease in the purchases of property, plant and equipment, and a decrease of $116.3 million in net purchases of available-for-sale securities.

Cash Provided by Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $507.1 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $727.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year was primarily attributable a $712.9 million decrease in net proceeds from public offerings of common stock, partially offset by $481.7 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Notes issued in August 2017.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $727.1 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $925.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year was primarily attributable a $175.3 million decrease in net proceeds from public offerings of common stock.

Other Information

Our $1.2 billion (undiscounted) of total convertible debt as of December 31, 2017 will impact our liquidity due to the semi-annual cash interest payments. Our indebtedness consists primarily of the Notes, which, if not converted, will be required to be repaid in cash at maturity in 2018, 2020 and 2024, respectively. Our senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2017 matured on April 23, 2017, with conversion of all principal amounts except for a final cash settlement of $26,000. See Note 13 to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.

In the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2018 Notes or 2020 Notes is triggered, holders of such Notes will be entitled to convert the 2018 Notes or 2020 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. In addition, the 2018 Notes will be freely convertible on or after July 15, 2018 and the 2020 Notes will be freely convertible on or after July 15, 2020. We intend to use a majority of the net proceeds we received from the issuance of the 2024 Notes to repay, repurchase or settle in cash some or all of the 2018 Notes. We may also elect to settle conversions of the 2020 Notes in cash, which could further affect our liquidity. While we could seek to obtain additional third-party financing to pay for any amounts due in cash upon such events, we cannot be sure that such third-party financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The $375.0 million principal amount of the 2018 Notes mature in October 2018 and therefore we have reclassified the net outstanding principal of the 2018 Notes as a current liability. Even if holders of the 2020 Notes do not elect to convert their 2020 Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of such Notes as a current liability rather than long-term liability (for example, when there are 12 months or less remaining until maturity), which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.

In August 2017, we completed an offering of $495.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes, which resulted in net proceeds of $481.7 million, after deducting commissions and offering expenses.

In August 2016, we sold 7.5 million shares of our common stock at a price of $96.00 per share in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement previously filed with the SEC. We received net proceeds of approximately $712.9 million from this public offering after accounting for the underwriting discount and offering costs.  

In November 2016 we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) providing for up to $100.0 million in revolving loans (the Revolving Credit Facility). We expect to use the proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility to finance ongoing working capital needs (including timing differences resulting from the strategic management of short-term investments) and for other general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2017, we had not drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility. Although quarterly interest payments will be due on any outstanding balance due, we anticipate any balance due to be short-term in nature. See Note 13 to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.

Funding Commitments

We cannot estimate with certainty the cost to complete any of our product development programs. Additionally, except as disclosed under “Overview” above, we cannot precisely estimate the time to complete any of our product development programs or when we expect to receive net cash inflows from any of our product development programs. Please see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of the reasons we are unable to estimate such information, and in particular the following risk factors:

•If we fail to obtain regulatory approval to commercially market and sell our product candidates, or if approval of our product candidates is delayed, we will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of these product candidates, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished, and the capital necessary to fund our operations will increase;

•If we are unable to successfully develop and maintain manufacturing processes for our products to produce sufficient quantities at acceptable costs, we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenue, have reduced margins or be forced to terminate a program;

•If we fail to compete successfully with respect to product sales, we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses related to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product and our revenue could be adversely affected.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – (Continued)

 

•If we do not achieve our projected development goals in the timeframes we announce and expect, the commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed and the credibility of our management

may be adversely affected and, as a result, our stock price may decline.

Our investment in our product development programs and continued development of our existing commercial products has a major impact on our operating performance. Our R&D expenses in the period since inception of our key programs were as follows (in millions):

We may elect to increase our spending above our current long-term plans and consequently we may be unable to achieve our long-term goals. This may increase our capital requirements, including: costs associated with the commercialization of our products; additional clinical trials; investments in the manufacturing of our commercial products; pre-clinical studies and clinical trials for our other product candidates; potential licenses and other acquisitions of complementary technologies, products and companies; and general corporate purposes.

Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:

 

•

product sales and profitability of our products;

 

•

manufacturing, supply or distribution of our product candidates and commercial products;

 

•

progress of our product candidates through the regulatory process and our ability to successfully commercialize any such products that receive regulatory approval;

 

•

results of clinical trials, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;

 

•

generic competition to Kuvan relating to our settlements with DRL and Par or potential generic competition from future competitors;

 

•

government regulatory action affecting our product candidates, our products or our competitors’ product candidates and products in both the U.S. and non-U.S. countries; and

 

•

developments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

We are also subject to contingent payments related to certain development and regulatory activities and commercial sales and licensing milestones totaling approximately $604.6 million as of December 31, 2017, which are due upon achievement of certain development and commercial milestones, and if they occur before certain dates in the future. Of this amount, $222.0 million (USD equivalent of €185 million translated at 1.20 USD per Euro as of December 31, 2017) relates to the Merck PKU Business acquisition and $53.4 million relates to programs that are no longer being developed.

As of December 31, 2017, we have recorded $189.0 million of contingent acquisition consideration payable on its Consolidated Balance Sheets in Short-term and Long-term Contingent Acquisition Consideration Payable, of which $53.6 million is expected to be paid by us in the next twelve months.

Any outstanding amounts due under the Revolving Credit Facility will be due in full in November 2018 with related interest due on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2017, there was no outstanding balance.
