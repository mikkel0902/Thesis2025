BUSINESS UPDATE
MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS
We continue to monitor the impacts of ongoing macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events. During 2023, material inflation continued to moderate. Slowing global growth relieved pressure on logistics freight and service capacity and provided supply chain redundancy. We continue to leverage short-term and long-term mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of supply chain disruptions, including digital solutions to assist in identifying and managing shortages.
Our mitigation strategies include pricing actions, longer term planning for constrained materials, new supplier development, material supply tracking tools, and direct engagement with key suppliers to meet customer demand. Our relationships with primary and secondary suppliers allow us to reliably source key components and raw materials. In areas where we cannot procure key components or raw materials, we consider altering existing products and developing new products to satisfy customer needs. Alterations to existing products and the development of new products undergo product quality controls and engineering qualification prior to releasing to our customers. In addition, we assist certain suppliers facing manufacturing challenges by committing our own resources to their sites and facilities. We believe these mitigation strategies enable us to reduce supply risk, accelerate new product innovation, and expand our penetration in the markets we serve. Additionally, due to the strenuous quality controls and product qualification we perform on a new or altered product, we do not expect these mitigation strategies to impact product quality or reliability.
Global conflicts continue to create volatility in global financial and energy markets and contribute to supply chain shortages adding to the inflationary pressures in the global economy. We actively collaborate with our suppliers to minimize impacts of supply shortages on our manufacturing capabilities.
To date, our strategies have successfully mitigated our exposure to these conditions. However, if we are not successful in sustaining or executing these strategies, these macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows.
See the section titled Review of Business Segments for additional information on the impacts of inflationary cost pressures and labor shortages to our businesses.
See the section titled Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with the potential adverse effects of inflationary cost pressures, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages to our businesses.
