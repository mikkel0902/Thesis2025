Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
(Dollar and share amounts in millions except percentages and per share amounts, except where noted otherwise)
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with Item 1A: Risk Factors, Item 6: Selected Financial Data, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.
OVERVIEW
Nordstrom is a leading fashion retailer offering an extensive selection of high-quality brand-name and private label apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories for women, men, young adults and children. We serve customers through two businesses — Full-Price and Off-Price. With customers increasingly engaging with Nordstrom in multiple ways, we focus on providing a seamless experience across stores and online. Our operations currently consist of our Nordstrom U.S. and Canada full-line stores, U.S. and Canada Nordstrom Rack stores, Jeffrey boutiques, Last Chance clearance stores, Trunk Club clubhouses and Nordstrom Local. Additionally, customers are served online through Nordstrom.com, Nordstromrack.com, HauteLook and TrunkClub.com.
Our unique business model is a key point of difference in serving customers in multiple ways — through stores, online, Full-Price and Off-Price — with meaningful synergies across Nordstrom. We are focused on leveraging our digital and physical assets to provide customers with a best-in-class experience.
In 2018, net earnings were $564, or $3.32 per diluted share, which included a $0.05 favorable income tax benefit related to prior periods and an estimated non-recurring credit-related charge of $0.28 (see Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). Our net sales grew 2.3%, or approximately 3.8% excluding approximately $220 related to the 53rd week in 2017. We maintained a strong financial position, generating annual operating cash flow of more than $1 billion for the 10th consecutive year and returning nearly $1 billion to shareholders in 2018.
In 2018, we achieved the following milestones in executing our customer strategy through our three strategic pillars: providing a compelling product offering, delivering exceptional services and experiences and leveraging the strength of the Nordstrom brand:
•
We continue to see positive customer trends. We had over 35 million customers, an increase of 6% from last year. One-third of our customers shopped across our multiple channels, resulting in incremental customer spend.
•
Our early investments to build a robust digital business gives us a competitive advantage. Digital sales increased 16% and made up 30% of net sales. Additionally, Nordstrom.com has achieved scale, with the profitability of Full-Price digital sales at parity with store sales.
•
Generational investments continued to scale, contributing approximately $2 billion in sales and improvement in profitability. Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook became our fastest business to reach $1 billion in sales. Trunk Club delivered sales growth of 35%. We opened our Men’s Store in New York City and furthered our expansion into Canada with the introduction of six Nordstrom Rack stores.
In 2019, we have two key priorities to drive sales and market share gains. The first key priority is our local market strategy, which launched in 2018 and drove outsized market share gains in Los Angeles. We are focused on scaling in this top market by giving customers greater access to merchandise selection and faster delivery. In addition, we are implementing aspects of our local market strategy in other markets. We will further leverage inventory through our supply chain investments. This includes an Omni-channel Hub in the Los Angeles area to accelerate inventory efficiencies, as well as a one-million square foot Omni-channel center in Riverside, California that will enable faster delivery to the West Coast, which represents 40% of our customer base, at a lower cost to us. While we’re launching this local market strategy in Los Angeles first, we anticipate expanding it to our top markets in the future. We expect to expand our presence in New York City with the planned opening of our Nordstrom NYC women’s store in October. We expect that our NYC flagship, coupled with our digital presence, will contribute a meaningful sales lift in that market.
Our second key priority to drive sales and market share gains is our loyalty program. In 2018, our loyalty customers grew 16% to 11 million and contributed 56% of our sales. In October 2018, we launched our enhanced program, The Nordy Club. Cardmembers now earn three points for every dollar spent, up from two points. In addition, we added experiential elements, such as exclusive access to services and experiences. Going forward, we plan to pursue additional opportunities to further personalize the customer experience and drive increased spend.
We remain focused on driving higher shareholder returns through three key deliverables: growing market share, improving profitability and shareholder returns and continuing our disciplined capital allocation approach. We are well-positioned to execute against our long-term plans and deliver a differentiated customer experience.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
In our ongoing effort to enhance the customer experience, we are focused on providing customers with a seamless experience across our channels. We invested early in our omni-channel capabilities, integrating our operations, merchandising and technology across our stores and online, in both our Full-Price and Off-Price businesses. While our customers may engage with us through multiple channels, we know they value the overall Nordstrom brand experience and view us simply as Nordstrom, which is ultimately how we view our business. We have one reportable segment in 2018, Retail, and analyze our results on a total Company basis.
Similar to other retailers, Nordstrom follows the retail 4-5-4 reporting calendar, which included an extra week in the fourth quarter of 2017 (the “53rd week”). References to 2018 and all years except 2017 within this document are based on a 52-week fiscal year, while 2017 is based on a 53-week fiscal year. However, the 53rd week is not included in the comparable sales calculations.
We may not calculate certain metrics used to evaluate our business in a consistent manner among industry peers. Provided below are definitions of metrics we present within our analysis:
•
Comparable Sales – sales from stores that have been open at least one full year at the beginning of the year. In 2019, we expect net sales growth to approximate comparable sales. As a result, we will only report net sales growth
•
Comparable sales include digital sales and actual returns. Our estimate for sales return allowance is not included in the comparable sales calculations.
•
Due to the 53rd week in 2017, our 2018 comparable sales are reported on a like-for-like basis with no impact from calendar shifts or the new Revenue Standard (see Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8).
•
Digital Sales – online sales and digitally assisted store sales which include Buy Online, Pick Up in Store (“BOPUS”), Ship to Store, Reserve Online, Try in Store (Store Reserve) and Style Board, a digital selling tool
•
Gross Profit – net sales less cost of sales and related buying and occupancy costs
•
Inventory Turnover Rate – trailing 4-quarter cost of sales and related buying and occupancy costs divided by the trailing 4-quarter average inventory
Net Sales
During the first quarter of 2018, we adopted the new Revenue Standard using the modified retrospective adoption method (see Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8). Results beginning in the first quarter of 2018 are presented under the new Revenue Standard, while prior period amounts are not adjusted. Also beginning in 2018, we aligned our sales presentation with how we view the results of our operations internally and how our customers shop with us, by our Full-Price and Off-Price businesses. In 2018, we allocated our sales return allowance and loyalty related adjustments to Full-Price and Off-Price. For 2017 and 2016, Other primarily included unallocated sales return, in-transit and loyalty related adjustments necessary to reconcile sales by business to total net sales.
•
Full-Price – Nordstrom U.S. full-line stores, Nordstrom.com, Canada, Trunk Club, Jeffrey and Nordstrom Local
•
Off-Price – Nordstrom U.S. Rack stores, Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook and Last Chance clearance stores

Net Sales (2018 vs. 2017)
In 2018, total Company net sales increased 2.3%, compared with 2017. This included a decrease of approximately 150 basis points due to the 53rd week, which contributed approximately $220 in additional net sales in 2017. Digital sales increased 16% compared with 2017. During the year, we opened our Nordstrom Men’s Store NYC, six Nordstrom Rack stores in Canada and six in the U.S., one Jeffrey boutique and two Nordstrom Locals. We closed two full-line stores and one Trunk Club clubhouse.
Full-Price net sales decreased 1.5%, compared with 2017. This included a decrease of approximately 300 basis points primarily due to loyalty related adjustments and the 53rd week. Full-Price sales reflected an increase in the average selling price per item sold, partially offset by a decrease in the number of items sold. Kids’ was the top-performing merchandise category.
Off-Price net sales increased 4.5%, compared with 2017. This included a decrease of approximately 250 basis points primarily due to the 53rd week and loyalty related adjustments. Off-Price sales reflected an increase in the number of items sold, partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price per item sold. The top-performing merchandise category was Shoes.
Net Sales (2017 vs. 2016)
In 2017, total Company net sales increased 4.4%, compared with 2016. Digital sales increased 16% compared with 2016. During the year, we opened two full-line stores, including one in Canada, and 17 Nordstrom Rack stores. The 53rd week contributed approximately $220 in additional net sales.
Full-Price net sales increased 1.9% compared with 2016. Full-Price sales reflected an increase in the average selling price per item sold and an increase in the number of items sold. Kids’ was the top-performing merchandise category.
Off-Price net sales increased 9.9% compared with 2016. Off-Price sales reflected an increase in the number of items sold, partially offset by a decrease in average selling price per item sold. Beauty was the top-performing merchandise category.
Credit Card Revenues, Net
Credit Card Revenues, net include our portion of the ongoing credit card revenue, net of credit losses, pursuant to our program agreement with TD whereby TD is the exclusive issuer of our consumer credit cards and we perform account servicing functions. In 2017 and 2016, we also recorded asset amortization and deferred revenue recognition associated with the assets and liabilities recorded as part of the initial transaction to sell our U.S. Visa and private label credit card portfolio to TD.
Upon adoption of the new Revenue Standard in 2018, the remaining unamortized balances of the investment in contract asset and deferred revenue associated with the sale of the credit card receivables were eliminated as part of a cumulative-effect adjustment, reducing the opening balance of accumulated deficit for 2018. As a result, the asset amortization and deferred revenue recognition are no longer recorded in credit card revenues, net (see Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8).
Credit Card Revenues, Net (2018 vs. 2017)
Credit Card Revenues, net increased $39 in 2018 reflecting our strategic partnership with TD to responsibly grow our receivables and associated revenues as well as efforts to drive new account growth. The 53rd week contributed $10 in additional revenue in 2017.
Credit Card Revenues, Net (2017 vs. 2016)
Credit Card Revenues, net increased $82 in 2017 due to the growth of our program and associated revenues as well as a reduction in amortization expense related to the sale of the credit card portfolio. The 53rd week contributed $10 in additional revenue in 2017.

Gross Profit (2018 vs. 2017)
Our gross profit rate decreased 26 basis points in 2018 when compared with 2017, largely due to higher Full-Price markdowns in the fourth quarter of 2018. Overall, continued focus on inventory execution led to improvements in inventory turnover rate in 2018.
Gross Profit (2017 vs. 2016)
Our gross profit rate decreased 23 basis points in 2017 when compared with 2016, primarily due to higher planned occupancy expenses related to new store growth for Nordstrom Rack and Canada. Continued focus on inventory execution led to improvements in inventory turnover rate in 2017.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (2018 vs. 2017)
Our SG&A rate increased 65 basis points and increased $206 in 2018 compared with 2017. The basis point increase was primarily due to the Estimated Non-recurring Charge of $72 in 2018 (see Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8). The dollar increase was primarily due to planned increases in supply chain and marketing costs and the Estimated Non-recurring Charge.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (2017 vs. 2016)
Our SG&A rate increased 104 basis points and increased $347 in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to planned technology and performance related expenses.
Goodwill Impairment
We recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $197 in 2016 related to Trunk Club (see Note 9: Fair Value Measurements in Item 8).

In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law. Among numerous other provisions, the Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. federal corporate income tax by reducing the statutory rate from 35% to 21%. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we made a reasonable estimate of the Tax Act’s impact and provisionally recorded this estimate in our 2017 results. As of February 2, 2019, we completed our accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act, resulting in no material changes to previously recorded provisional amounts.
The following table illustrates the components of our effective tax rate:

1 The statutory rate in 2018 and 2017 is reduced due to the Tax Act.
Income Tax Expense (2018 vs. 2017)
The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to the lower statutory tax rate enacted under the Tax Act, the benefit of certain current year foreign losses and the release of a foreign valuation allowance (see Note 14: Income Taxes in Item 8).
Income Tax Expense (2017 vs. 2016)
The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $197 related to Trunk Club in the third quarter of 2016 (see Note 9: Fair Value Measurements in Item 8). Excluding the impact of the Trunk Club goodwill impairment, our effective tax rate for 2017 would have increased approximately 700 basis points compared with 2016 primarily as a result of the Tax Act. Net earnings in 2017 included $42 related to the Tax Act, which includes a provisional, one-time tax charge of $51 related to the revaluation of net deferred tax assets, partially offset by cash savings from a lower federal tax rate.

$2.59

 

$2.02

Earnings Per Share (2018 vs. 2017)
The increase in diluted EPS of $0.73 was primarily due to a lower tax rate, partially offset by the Estimated Non-recurring Charge of $0.28 (see Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8).
Earnings Per Share (2017 vs. 2016)
For 2017, diluted EPS of $2.59 included impacts associated with the Tax Act consisting of a $0.25 per share reduction related to our income tax provision and a $0.06 per share decrease for a one-time investment in our employees. The impact of the Trunk Club goodwill impairment charge of $197 in 2016 was approximately $1.12 per share. Excluding the impact of these items, diluted EPS decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 due to planned increases in supply chain and technology costs associated with our growth initiatives, partially offset by an increase in net sales.
Fiscal Year 2019 Outlook
We are committed to achieving long-term financial targets, which support three strategic objectives in driving shareholder returns: continuing market share gains, improving profitability and returns, and maintaining disciplined capital allocation. Our expectations for fiscal 2019 are as follows:
Net sales growth
1 percent to 2 percent
Credit card revenues, net
Mid to high single-digit growth
EBIT
$915 to $970 million
EBIT margin
5.9 percent to 6.1 percent
Earnings per diluted share (excluding the impact of any potential future share repurchase)
$3.65 to $3.90
Our guidance also incorporates the following assumptions:
•
We measure our performance through market share, customers and net sales metrics. As comparable sales growth is expected to approximate net sales growth in 2019, we will only report net sales growth.
•
The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 26%.
•
Estimated outstanding shares are expected to be approximately 162, which excludes the impact of any potential future share repurchases.

Adjusted ROIC (Non-GAAP financial measure)
We believe that Adjusted ROIC is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the capital we have invested in our business to generate returns. Adjusted ROIC adjusts our operating leases as if they met the criteria for capital leases or we had purchased the properties. This provides additional supplemental information that reflects the investment in our off-balance sheet operating leases, controls for differences in capital structure between us and our competitors and provides investors and credit agencies with another way to comparably evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our capital investments over time. In addition, we incorporate Adjusted ROIC into our executive incentive measures and it is an important indicator of shareholders’ return over the long term.
We define Adjusted ROIC as our adjusted net operating profit after tax divided by our average invested capital using the trailing 12-month average. Adjusted ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, return on assets, net earnings, total assets or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies’ methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. Estimated depreciation on capitalized operating leases and average estimated asset base of capitalized operating leases are not calculated in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution of our results as reported under GAAP. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted ROIC is return on assets. The following is a reconciliation of the components of Adjusted ROIC and return on assets:

1 Capitalized operating leases is our best estimate of the asset base we would record for our leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease or we had purchased the property. The asset base is calculated based upon the trailing 12-month average of the monthly asset base. The asset base for each month is calculated as the trailing 12 months of rent expense multiplied by eight. The multiple of eight times rent expense is a commonly used method of estimating the asset base we would record for our capitalized operating leases. We do not expect the adoption of the new Lease Standard to have a material impact on our Adjusted ROIC (see Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8).
2 Balances associated with our deferred rent liability have been classified as long-term liabilities as of January 28, 2017.
3 Results for the 12 fiscal months ended February 2, 2019 include lower income tax expense primarily associated with the Tax Act and a $72 unfavorable impact related to the Estimated Non-recurring Charge (see Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8). Results for the 12 fiscal months ended February 3, 2018 include a $42 unfavorable impact related to the Tax Act. Results for the 12 fiscal months ended January 28, 2017 include a $197 unfavorable impact of the Trunk Club non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2016.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We strive to maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to allow us to cover our seasonal cash needs and to maintain appropriate levels of short-term borrowings. We believe that our operating cash flows, available credit facility and potential future borrowings are sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months and beyond.
Over the long term, we manage our cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, maintain our financial position, manage refinancing risk and allow flexibility for strategic initiatives. We regularly assess our debt and leverage levels, capital expenditure requirements, debt service payments, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and other future investments. We believe that as of February 2, 2019, our existing cash and cash equivalents on-hand of $957, available credit facility of $800 and potential future operating cash flows and borrowings will be sufficient to fund these scheduled future payments and potential long-term initiatives.

Operating Activities
The majority of our operating cash inflows are derived from sales. We also receive cash payments for property incentives from developers. Our operating cash outflows generally consist of payments to our merchandise vendors (net of vendor allowances), payments to our employees for wages, salaries and other employee benefits and payments to our landlords for rent. Operating cash outflows also include payments for income taxes and interest payments on our short-term and long-term borrowings.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $104 between 2018 and 2017 primarily due to the timing of payroll and increased incentive compensation payouts, which included $16 for our one-time investment in employees in response to the Tax Act, paid in 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $258 between 2017 and 2016 primarily due to the timing of tax refunds and payments.
Investing Activities
Our investing cash inflows are generally from proceeds from sales of property and equipment. Our investing cash outflows include payments for capital expenditures, including stores, supply chain improvements and technology costs. In addition, other investing includes payments for investments in other companies, as well as proceeds from distributions or sales of these investments.
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $31 between 2018 and 2017 and $107 between 2017 and 2016 primarily due to decreases in capital expenditures, partially offset by the acquisitions of two retail technology companies in 2018, which were classified in other investing activities, net (see Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8).

Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 27
Table of Contents



Capital expenditures, net decreased $66 in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to fewer new Nordstrom Rack store openings and U.S. full-line relocations, partially offset by increased supply chain investments. Capital expenditures, net decreased $114 in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to fewer Canada full-line store openings.
Our capital expenditures, net were $3,726, or 5% of net sales, over the last five years. We estimate our spending as a percent of sales in 2019 to increase to 6%, as we shifted approximately $100 in projects from 2018, and will consist primarily of investments in our Supply Chain Network and Nordstrom NYC. As we near the end of our generational investments cycle, we expect capital expenditure levels to moderate in 2020.
Financing Activities
The majority of our financing activities include common stock repurchases, long-term debt proceeds or payments and dividend payments.
Net cash used in financing activities increased $325 between 2018 and 2017 primarily due to increased share repurchase activity, partially offset by increased proceeds from stock option exercises, driven by a higher stock price. Net cash used in financing activities increased $87 between 2017 and 2016 primarily due to a decrease in cash book overdrafts as a result of payment timing differences.
Share Repurchases
In February 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to $500 of our outstanding common stock, through August 31, 2018. There was $319 of unused capacity upon this program’s expiration. In August 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to $1,500 of our outstanding common stock, with no expiration date.
Under the February 2017 program until it expired and then under the August 2018 program, we repurchased 14.3 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $702 during 2018. We had $893 remaining in share repurchase capacity as of February 2, 2019. The actual timing, price, manner and amounts of future share repurchases, if any, will be subject to market and economic conditions and applicable SEC rules.
Borrowing Activity
During 2017, we issued $350 aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured notes due March 2027 and $300 aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior unsecured notes due January 2044. We recorded debt issuance costs incurred as a result of the issuance in other financing activities, net in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. With the proceeds of these new notes, we retired our $650 senior unsecured notes that were due January 2018 (see Note 8: Debt and Credit Facilities in Item 8).
Additionally, in 2018, we fully repaid $47 outstanding on our wholly owned subsidiary Puerto Rico’s unsecured borrowing facility (see Note 8: Debt and Credit Facilities in Item 8).
Dividends
In 2018, we paid dividends of $250, or $1.48 per share, compared with $247, or $1.48 per share, in 2017 and $256, or $1.48 per share, in 2016. In determining the dividends to pay, we analyze our dividend payout ratio and dividend yield, while taking into consideration our current and projected operating performance and liquidity. Our dividend payout ratio target range is 30% to 40% of the prior year’s net earnings.
In February 2019, subsequent to year end, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, which will be paid on March 26, 2019 to holders of record as of March 11, 2019.

Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP financial measure)
Free Cash Flow is one of our key liquidity measures, and when used in conjunction with GAAP measures, provides investors with a meaningful analysis of our ability to generate cash from our business.
Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we no longer adjust free cash flow for cash dividends paid. We believe this presentation is more reflective of our operating performance and more consistent with the way we manage our business, how our peers calculate free cash flows and prevailing industry practice. Prior period Free Cash Flow financial measures have been recast to conform with current period presentation.
Free Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating cash flows or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies’ methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow is net cash provided by operating activities. The following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow:

Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP financial measure)
Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) is our key financial metric to reflect our view of cash flow from net earnings. Adjusted EBITDA excludes significant items which are non-operating in nature in order to evaluate our core operating performance against prior periods. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net earnings.

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for net earnings, overall change in cash or liquidity of the business as a whole. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies’ methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies.

Credit Capacity and Commitments
As of February 2, 2019, we had total short-term borrowing capacity of $800. In September 2018, we renewed our existing $800 senior unsecured revolving credit facility (“revolver”), extending the expiration from April 2020 to September 2023. Our revolver contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and terms, which are substantially similar to our 2015 revolver. Under the terms of our revolver, we pay a variable rate of interest and a commitment fee based on our debt rating. The revolver is available for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. Provided that we obtain written consent from our lenders, we have the option to increase the revolving commitment by up to $200, to a total of $1,000, and two options to extend the revolving commitment by one year.
Our $800 commercial paper program allows us to use the proceeds to fund operating cash requirements. Under the terms of the commercial paper agreement, we pay a rate of interest based on, among other factors, the maturity of the issuance and market conditions. The issuance of commercial paper has the effect, while it is outstanding, of reducing available liquidity under the revolver by an amount equal to the principal amount of commercial paper.
As of February 2, 2019, we had no issuances outstanding under our commercial paper program and no borrowings outstanding under our revolver.
Our wholly owned subsidiary in Puerto Rico maintained a $52 unsecured borrowing facility to support our expansion into that market. Borrowings on this facility incurred interest at an annual rate based upon LIBOR plus 1.275% and also incurred a fee based on any unused commitment. In 2018, we fully repaid $47 outstanding on this facility, which was included in the current portion of long-term debt. This facility expired in the fourth quarter of 2018.
We maintain trade and standby letters of credit to facilitate our international payments. As of February 2, 2019, we have $8 available and none outstanding under the trade letter of credit and $15 available and $2 outstanding under the standby letter of credit.
Plans for our Nordstrom NYC store, which we currently expect to open in October 2019, ultimately include owning a condominium interest in a mixed-use tower and leasing certain nearby properties. As of February 2, 2019, we had approximately $302 of fee interest in land, which is expected to convert to the condominium interest once the store is constructed. We have committed to make future installment payments based on the developer meeting pre-established construction and development milestones. In the event that this project is not completed, the opening may be delayed and we may be subject to future losses or capital commitments in order to complete construction or to monetize our investment.
Impact of Credit Ratings
Under the terms of our revolver, any borrowings we may enter into will accrue interest for Euro-Dollar Rate Loans at a floating base rate tied to LIBOR, for Canadian Dealer Offer Rate Loans at a floating rate tied to CDOR, and for Base Rate Loans at the highest of: (i) the Euro-Dollar rate plus 100 basis points, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points and (iii) the prime rate.
The rate depends upon the type of borrowing incurred, plus in each case an applicable margin. This applicable margin varies depending upon the credit ratings assigned to our long-term unsecured debt. At the time of this report, our long-term unsecured debt ratings, outlook and resulting applicable margin were as follows:

Should the ratings assigned to our long-term unsecured debt improve, the applicable margin associated with any such borrowings may decrease, resulting in a lower borrowing cost under this facility. Should the ratings assigned to our long-term unsecured debt worsen, the applicable margin associated with our borrowings may increase, resulting in a higher borrowing cost under this facility.
Debt Covenants
The revolver requires that we maintain an adjusted debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (“EBITDAR”) leverage ratio of no more than four times. As of February 2, 2019, we were in compliance with this covenant.

Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR (Non-GAAP financial measure)
Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is one of our key financial metrics, and we believe that our debt levels are best analyzed using this measure. Our goal is to manage debt levels to maintain an investment-grade credit rating and operate with an efficient capital structure. In evaluating our debt levels, this measure provides a reflection of our credit worthiness that could impact our credit rating and borrowing costs. We also have a debt covenant that requires an adjusted debt to EBITDAR leverage ratio of no more than four times.
Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, debt to net earnings, net earnings, debt or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies’ methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. Estimated capitalized operating lease liability is not calculated in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution of our results as reported under GAAP. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is debt to net earnings. The following is a reconciliation of the components of Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR and debt to net earnings:

2 Based upon the estimated lease liability as of the end of the period, calculated as the trailing 12 months of rent expense multiplied by eight. The multiple of eight times rent expense is a commonly used method of estimating the debt we would record for our leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease or we had purchased the property. We do not expect the adoption of the new Lease Standard to have a material impact on our Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR (see Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8).
3 Results for the 12 fiscal months ended February 2, 2019 include lower income tax expense primarily associated with the Tax Act and a $72 unfavorable impact related to the Estimated Non-recurring Charge (see Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8). Results for the 12 fiscal months ended February 3, 2018 include a $42 unfavorable impact related to the Tax Act.

Included in the required debt repayments disclosed above are estimated total interest payments of $1,822 as of February 2, 2019, payable over the remaining life of the debt.
The operating lease obligations in the table above do not include payments for operating expenses that are required by most of our lease agreements. Such expenses, which include common area charges, real estate taxes and other executory costs, totaled $138 in 2018, $121 in 2017 and $112 in 2016. In addition, some of our leases require additional rental payments based on a percentage of our sales, referred to as “percentage rent.” Percentage rent, which is also excluded from the obligations in the table above, was $9 in 2018, $11 in 2017 and $12 in 2016.
Purchase obligations primarily consist of inventory purchase orders and capital expenditure commitments. Capital expenditure commitments include Nordstrom NYC.
Other long-term liabilities consist of workers’ compensation and other liability insurance reserves and postretirement benefits. The payment amounts presented above were estimated based on historical payment trends. Other long-term liabilities not requiring cash payments, such as deferred property incentives and deferred revenue, were excluded from the table above. Also excluded from the table above are unrecognized tax benefits of $33, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash payments, if any, for these liabilities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Pursuant to the program agreement with TD, we offer and administer a loyalty program and perform other account servicing functions (see Note 3: Credit Card Receivable Transaction in Item 8). Credit card receivables serviced under this contract are $3,651 as of February 2, 2019.
Other than items noted in the paragraph above, in addition to operating leases entered into in the normal course of business and the development of our Nordstrom Men’s Store NYC and Nordstrom NYC, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements during 2018.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The following discussion highlights the estimates we believe are critical and should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit & Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit & Finance Committee has reviewed our disclosures that follow.
Revenue Recognition
During the first quarter of 2018, we adopted the new Revenue Standard using the modified retrospective adoption method (see Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8). Results beginning in the first quarter of 2018 are presented under the new Revenue Standard, while prior period amounts are not adjusted.
We recognize sales revenue net of estimated returns and excluding sales taxes. Revenue from sales to customers shipped from our Supply Chain Network facilities, stores and directly from our vendors (“shipped revenues”), which includes shipping revenue when applicable, is recognized at shipping point, the point in time where control has transferred to the customer. Costs to ship orders to customers are expensed as a fulfillment activity at shipping point, commissions from sales at our Full-Price stores are expensed at the point of sale and both are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Prior to 2018, shipped revenues were recognized upon estimated receipt by the customer and we recorded an estimated in-transit allowance for orders shipped prior to a period’s end, but not yet received by the customer.

Table of Contents



We reduce sales and cost of sales by an estimate of customer merchandise returns, which is calculated based on historical return patterns, and record a sales return allowance and an estimated returns asset. Our sales return allowance is classified in other current liabilities and our estimated returns asset, calculated based on the cost of merchandise sold, is classified in prepaid expenses and other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Due to the seasonality of our business, these balances typically increase with higher sales occurring in the last month of a period, such as the Anniversary Sale typically at the end of the second quarter, and decrease in the following period. Prior to 2018, the estimated cost of merchandise returned was netted with our sales return allowance in other current liabilities.
Although we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates of sales returns, actual returns could differ from recorded amounts. In the past three years, there were no significant changes in customer return behavior and we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of our sales return allowance. A 10% change in the sales return allowance net of the estimated returns asset would have had a $15 impact on our net earnings for the year ended February 2, 2019.
As our customers earn points and Notes in The Nordy Club, a portion of underlying sales revenue is deferred based on an estimated stand-alone selling price of points, Notes and other loyalty benefits, such as alterations. We recognize the revenue and related cost of sale when the Notes are ultimately redeemed and reduce our contract liability. We include the deferred revenue in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We record breakage revenue of unused points and unredeemed Notes based on expected customer redemption. We estimate, based on historical usage, that 6% of Notes will be unredeemed and recognized as revenue. Other benefits of the loyalty program, including shopping and fashion events, are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as these are not a material right of the program.
Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market value using the retail inventory method. Under the retail method, the valuation of inventories is determined by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory. The value of our inventory on the balance sheet is then reduced by a charge to cost of sales for retail inventory markdowns taken on the selling price. To determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down, we consider current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise and fashion trends. Inherent in the retail inventory method are certain management judgments that may affect the ending inventory valuation as well as gross profit.
We take physical inventory counts and adjust our records accordingly. Following each physical inventory cycle, we adjust shrink to actual results and an estimate is recorded for shrink from the count date to year end. We evaluate and determine our estimated shrinkage rate, which is based on a percentage of sales, using the most recent physical inventory and historical results.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long-lived assets, including buildings, equipment and amortizable intangible assets, may be impaired, we perform an evaluation of recoverability by comparing the carrying values of the net assets to their related projected undiscounted future cash flows, in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses.
Land, property and equipment are grouped at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment. Cash flows for our retail store assets are identified at the individual store level, while our intangible assets associated with HauteLook and Trunk Club are identified at their respective reporting unit levels.
Our estimates are subject to uncertainties and may be impacted by various external factors such as economic conditions and market competition. While we believe the inputs and assumptions utilized in our analyses of future cash flows are reasonable, events or circumstances may change, which could cause us to revise these estimates.
Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Using this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is determined that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.
We regularly evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal, state and foreign filings by considering all relevant facts, circumstances and information available. If we believe it is more likely than not that our position will be sustained, we recognize a benefit at the largest amount that we believe is cumulatively greater than 50% likely to be realized. Our unrecognized tax benefit was $30 as of February 2, 2019, and $31 as of February 3, 2018. Interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense.

Income taxes require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Also, as audits are completed or statutes of limitations lapse, it may be necessary to record adjustments to our taxes payable, deferred taxes, tax reserves or income tax expense. Such adjustments did not materially impact our effective income tax rate in 2018, 2017 or 2016.
In December 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we made a reasonable estimate of the Tax Act’s impact and provisionally recorded this estimate in our 2017 results. As of February 2, 2019, we have completed our accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act, resulting in no material changes to previously recorded provisional amounts (see Note 14: Income Taxes in Item 8).
