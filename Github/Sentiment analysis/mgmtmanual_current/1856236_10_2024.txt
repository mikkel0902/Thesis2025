Overview 

We are the largest and fastest-growing franchisor and operator of out-of-home (“OOH”) waxing services in the United States by number of centers and system-wide sales. We delivered over 23 million waxing services in 2023 and over 22 million waxing services in 2022 generating $955 million and $899 million of system-wide sales, respectively, across our highly-franchised network. We have a leading portfolio of centers operating in 1,044 locations across 45 states as of January 6, 2024. Of these locations, 1,038 are franchised centers operated by franchisees and six are corporate-owned centers. 

The European Wax Center brand is trusted, efficacious and accessible. Our culture is obsessed with our guest experience and we deliver a superior guest experience relative to smaller chains and independent salons. We offer guests high-quality, hygienic waxing services administered by our licensed, EWC-trained estheticians (our “wax specialists”), at our accessible and welcoming locations (our “centers”). Our technology-enabled guest interface simplifies and streamlines the guest experience with automated appointment scheduling and remote check-in capabilities, ensuring guest visits are convenient, hassle-free, and consistent across our network of centers. Our well-known, pre-paid Wax Pass program makes payment easy and convenient, fostering loyalty and return visits. Guests view us as a non-discretionary part of their personal-care and beauty regimens, providing us with a highly predictable and growing recurring revenue model.

Our asset-light franchise platform delivers capital-efficient growth, significant cash flow generation and resilience through economic cycles. Our centers are 99% owned and operated by our franchisees who benefit from superior unit-level economics, with mature centers generating annual cash-on-cash returns in excess of 50%. 

In partnership with our franchisees, we fiercely protect our points of differentiation that attract new guests, build meaningful relationships and promote lasting retention. We are so confident in our ability to delight that we have always offered all of our guests their first wax free.

Hair removal solutions are consistently in demand, given the recurring nature of hair growth. The OOH waxing market is the fastest-growing hair removal solution in the United States, defined by an estimated total addressable market of over $18 billion with annualized growth that is more than double other hair removal alternatives. European Wax Center has become the category-defining brand within this rapidly growing market and became so by professionalizing a highly fragmented sector where service consistency, hygiene, and customer trust were not historically offered. We are approximately six times larger than the next largest waxing-focused competitor by center count and approximately 11 times larger by system-wide sales. Our unmatched scale enables us to drive broader brand awareness, ensures our licensed wax specialists are universally trained at the highest standards and drive consistent financial performance across each center.

Under the stewardship of our CEO, David Willis, and the other management team members, we have prioritized building a culture of performance, success, and inclusivity. Additionally, we have intensified our focus on enhancing the guest experience and have invested significantly in our corporate infrastructure and marketing capabilities to continue our track record of sustainable growth. The foundation for our next chapter of growth is firmly in place.

Growth Strategy and Outlook

We plan to grow our business primarily by opening new franchised centers as well as increasing our system-wide sales in existing centers while leveraging our corporate infrastructure to expand our profit margins and generate robust free cash flow.  

45

 

We believe our franchisees’ track record of successfully opening new centers and consistently generating attractive unit-level economics validates our strategy to expand our footprint and grow our capacity to serve more guests. Our center count grew 11% and 11% during fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2022, respectively, and has grown each year since 2010. Our thoughtful approach to growth ensures each center is appropriately staffed with the high-quality team and licensed, highly-trained wax specialists that our brand has been known for since our initial opening. We believe that none of our existing markets are fully penetrated, and that we have a significant whitespace opportunity of more than 3,000 locations for our standard center format across the United States. Our centers have a long track record of sustained growth delivering consistent positive same-store sales growth with resilient performance through economic cycles. 

Our straightforward, asset-light franchise platform and our proven track record of increasing profitability is expected to continue to drive EBITDA margin accretion and free cash flow generation as we expand our national footprint. We have invested in building our scalable support infrastructure, and we currently have the capabilities and systems in place to drive revenue growth and profitability across our existing and planned franchise centers.

Key Business Metrics

We track the following key business metrics to evaluate our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Accordingly, we believe that these key business metrics provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team. These key business metrics are presented for supplemental information purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled metrics or measures presented by other companies. 

Number of Centers. Number of centers reflects the number of franchised and corporate-owned centers open at the end of the reporting period. We review the number of new center openings, the number of closed centers and the number of relocations of centers to assess net new center growth, and drivers of trends in system-wide sales, royalty and franchise fee revenue and corporate-owned center sales.

System-Wide Sales. System-wide sales represent sales from same day services, retail sales and cash collected from wax passes for all centers in our network, including both franchisee-owned and corporate-owned centers. While we do not record franchised center sales as revenue, our royalty revenue is calculated based on a percentage of franchised center sales, which are 6.0% of sales, net of retail product sales, as defined in the franchise agreement. This measure allows us to better assess changes in our royalty revenue, our overall center performance, the health of our brand and the strength of our market position relative to competitors. Our system-wide sales growth is driven by net new center openings as well as increases in same-store sales.

Same-Store Sales. Same-store sales reflect the change in year-over-year sales from services performed and retail sales for the same-store base. We define the same-store base to include those centers open for at least 52 full weeks. If a center is closed for greater than six consecutive days, the center is deemed a closed center and is excluded from the calculation of same-store sales until it has been reopened for a continuous 52 full weeks. This measure highlights the performance of existing centers, while excluding the impact of new center openings and closures. We review same-store sales for corporate-owned centers as well as franchisee-owned centers. Same-store sales growth is driven by increases in the number of transactions and average transaction size.

New Center Openings. The number of new center openings reflects centers opened during a particular reporting period for both franchisee-owned and corporate-owned centers, less centers closed during the same period. Opening new centers is an integral part of our growth strategy, and we expect the majority of our future new centers to be franchisee-owned. Before we obtain the certificate of occupancy or report any revenue from new corporate-owned centers, we incur pre-opening costs, such as rent expense, labor expense and other operating expenses. Some of our centers open with an initial start-up period of higher-than-normal marketing and operating expenses, particularly as a percentage of monthly revenue.

Average Unit Volume (“AUV”). AUV consists of the average annual system-wide sales of all centers that have been open for a trailing 52-week period or longer. This measure is calculated by dividing system-wide sales during the applicable period for all centers being measured by the number of centers being measured. AUV allows management to assess our franchisee-owned and corporate-owned center economics. Our AUV growth is primarily driven by increases in services and retail product sales as centers fill their books of reservations, which we refer to as maturation of centers.

46

 

Wax Pass Utilization. We define Wax Pass utilization as the adoption of our Wax Pass program by guests, measured as a percentage of total transactions conducted using a Wax Pass. Wax Pass utilization allows management to better assess the recurring nature of our business model because it is an indication of the magnitude of transactions by guests who have made a longer-term commitment to our brand by purchasing a Wax Pass.

Significant Factors Impacting Our Financial Results 

We believe there are several important factors that have impacted, and that we expect will continue to impact, our business and results of operations. These factors include:

New Center Openings. We expect that new centers will be a key driver of growth in our future revenue and operating profit results. Opening new centers is an important part of our growth strategy, and we expect the majority of our future new centers will be franchisee-owned. Our results of operations have been and will continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new center openings each period. As centers mature, center revenue and profitability increase significantly. The performance of new centers may vary depending on various factors such as the effective management and cooperation of our franchisee partners, whether the franchise is part of a multi-unit development agreement, the center opening date, the time of year of a particular opening, the number of licensed wax specialists recruited, and the location of the new center, including whether it is located in a new or existing market. Our planned center expansion will place increased demands on our operational, managerial, administrative, financial, and other resources. 

System-Wide Sales Growth. System-wide sales growth is a key driver of our business. Various factors affect system-wide sales, including:

•
consumer preferences and overall economic trends;
•
the recurring, non-discretionary nature of personal-care services and purchases;
•
our ability to identify and respond effectively to guest preferences and trends;
•
our ability to provide a variety of service offerings that generate new and repeat visits to our centers;
•
the guest experience we provide in our centers;
•
the availability of experienced wax specialists;
•
our ability to source and deliver products accurately and timely;
•
changes in service or product pricing, including promotional activities;
•
the number of services or items purchased per center visit;
•
center closures in response to state or local regulations or health concerns
Overall Economic Trends. Macroeconomic factors that may affect guest spending patterns, and thereby our results of operations, include employment rates, the rate of inflation, business conditions, changes in the housing market, the availability of credit, interest rates, tax rates and fuel and energy costs. However, we believe that our guests see our services as largely non-discretionary in nature. 

47

 

Therefore, we believe that overall economic trends and related changes in consumer behavior have less of an impact on our business than they may have for other industries subject to fluctuations in discretionary consumer spending.

Guest Preferences and Demands. Our ability to maintain our appeal to existing guests and attract new guests depends on our ability to develop and offer a compelling assortment of services responsive to guest preferences and trends. We also believe that OOH waxing is a recurring need that brings guests back for services on a highly recurring basis which is reflected in the predictability of our financial performance over time. Our guests’ routine personal-care need for OOH waxing is further demonstrated by the top 20% of guests who visit us, on average, approximately every five weeks.

Our Ability to Source and Distribute Products Effectively. Our revenue and operating income are affected by our ability to purchase our products and supplies in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. While we believe our vendors have adequate capacity to meet our current and anticipated demand, our level of revenue could be adversely affected in the event we face constraints in our supply chain, including the inability of our vendors to produce sufficient quantities of some products or supplies in a manner that matches market demand from our guests, leading to lost revenue. We depend on two key suppliers to source our Comfort Wax and one key supplier to source our branded retail products and we are thus exposed to concentration of supplier risk. 

Our Ability to Recruit and Retain Qualified Licensed Wax Specialists for our Franchised Centers. Our franchisee's ability to operate their centers is largely dependent upon their ability to attract and retain qualified, licensed wax specialists. Our unmatched scale enables us to ensure that we universally train our wax specialists at the highest standards, ensuring that our guests experience consistent level of quality, regardless of the specific center they visit. The combination of consistent service delivery, across our trained base of wax specialists, along with the payment ease and convenience of our well-known, pre-paid Wax Pass program fosters loyalty and return visits across our guest base. Over time, our ability to build and maintain a strong pipeline of licensed wax specialists is important to preserving our current brand position.

Seasonality. Our results are subject to seasonality fluctuations in that services are typically in higher demand in periods leading up to holidays and the summer season. The resulting demand trend has historically yielded higher system-wide sales in the second and fourth quarter of our fiscal year. In addition, our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, because of several factors, including the timing of center openings, price increases and promotions, and general economic conditions. 

Components of Results of Operations 

Revenue 

Product Sales:   Product sales consist of revenue earned from sales of Comfort Wax, other products consumed in administering our wax services and retail merchandise to franchisees, as well as retail merchandise sold in corporate-owned centers. Revenue on product sales is recognized upon transfer of control. Our product sales revenue comprised 56.7% and 56.8% of our total revenue for the years ended January 6, 2024 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Royalty Fees:   Royalty fees are earned based on a percentage of the franchisees’ gross sales, net of retail product sales, as defined in the applicable franchise agreement, and recognized in the period the franchisees’ sales occur. The royalty fee is 6.0% of the franchisees’ gross sales for such period and is paid weekly. Our royalty fees revenue comprised 24.1% and 24.0% of our total revenue for the years ended January 6, 2024 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Marketing Fees:   Marketing fees are earned based on 3.0% of the franchisees’ gross sales, net of retail product sales, as defined in the applicable franchise agreement, and recognized in the period the franchisees’ sales occur. Additionally, the Company charges a fixed monthly fee to franchisees for search engine optimization and search engine marketing services, which is due on a monthly basis and recognized in the period when services are provided. Our marketing fees revenue comprised 13.6% and 13.5% of our total revenue for the years ended January 6, 2024 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

Other Revenue:   Other revenue primarily consists of service revenues from our corporate-owned centers and franchise fees, as well as technology fees, annual brand conference revenues and training, which together represent 5.6% and 5.7% of our total revenue for the years ended January 6, 2024 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Service revenues from our corporate-owned centers are recognized at the time services are provided. Amounts collected in advance of the period in which service is rendered are recorded as deferred revenue. Franchise fees are paid upon commencement of the franchise agreement and are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis commencing at contract inception through the end of the franchise license term. Franchise agreements generally have terms of 10 years beginning on the date the center is opened and the initial franchise fees are amortized over a period approximating the term of the agreement. Deferred franchise fees expected to be recognized in periods greater than 12 months from the reporting date are classified as long-term on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Technology fees, annual brand conference revenues and training are recognized as the related services are delivered and are not material to the overall business. 

Costs and Expenses 

Cost of Revenue:   Cost of revenue primarily consists of the direct costs associated with wholesale product and retail merchandise sold, including distribution and outbound freight costs and inventory obsolescence charges, as well as the cost of materials and labor for services rendered in our corporate-owned centers. 

48

 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:   Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages, benefits and other compensation-related costs, rent, software, and other administrative expenses incurred to support our existing franchise and corporate-owned centers, as well as expenses attributable to growth and development activities. Also included in selling, general and administrative expenses are accounting, legal, marketing operations, and other professional fees. 

Advertising Expenses:   Advertising expenses consist of advertising, public relations, and administrative expenses incurred to increase sales and further enhance the public reputation of the European Wax Center brand. 

Depreciation and Amortization:   Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of property and equipment and capitalized leasehold improvements, as well as amortization of intangible assets, including franchisee relationships and reacquired area representative rights. Area representative rights represent an agreement with area representatives to sell franchise licenses and provide support to franchisees in a geographic region. From time to time, the Company enters into agreements to reacquire certain area representative rights.

Interest Expense, net:   Interest expense consists of interest on our long-term debt, including amounts outstanding under our revolving financing facility, amortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs, gains and losses on debt extinguishment as well as interest income from short-term, highly-liquid investments. 

Other (Income) Expense: Other (income) expense consists of non-cash gains and losses related to the remeasurement of our tax receivable agreement liability and contractual cash interest paid on our tax receivable agreement liability.  

Income Tax Expense: We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income of EWC Ventures and are taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. Income tax expense includes both current and deferred income tax expense. 

Noncontrolling Interests: We are the sole managing member of EWC Ventures. Because we manage and operate the business and control the strategic decisions and day-to-day operations of EWC Ventures and also have a substantial financial interest in EWC Ventures, we consolidate the financial results of EWC Ventures, and a portion of our net income (loss) is allocated to the noncontrolling interests to reflect the entitlement of the members of EWC Ventures after our initial public offering (the “EWC Ventures Post-IPO Members”) to a portion of EWC Ventures’ net income (loss).

Comparison of the Years Ended January 6, 2024 and December 31, 2022 

Revenue 

Total revenue increased $13.7 million, or 6.6%, to $221.0 million during the year ended January 6, 2024, compared to $207.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in total revenue was primarily due to 100 net new center openings that became operational during the period from January 1, 2023 to January 6, 2024 as well as an additional offering of medical products to our centers for use in administering wax services. 

Product Sales 

Product sales increased $7.5 million, or 6.4%, to $125.3 million during the year ended January 6, 2024, compared to $117.7 million for the year December 31, 2022. The increase in product sales was primarily due to new center openings that became operational during the period from January 1, 2023 to January 6, 2024. In addition, product sales increased due to an additional offering of medical products to our centers for use in administering wax services that began in April 2022. 

Royalty Fees 

Royalty fees increased $3.6 million, or 7.3%, to $53.4 million during the year ended January 6, 2024, compared to $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in royalty fees during the year ended January 6, 2024 was primarily due to the increase in same-store sales in the year ended January 6, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, royalty fees increased due to new center openings that became operational in the period from January 1, 2023 to January 6, 2024.

Marketing Fees 

Marketing fees increased $2.0 million, or 7.0%, to $30.0 million during the year ended January 6, 2024, compared to $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in marketing fees during the year ended January 6, 2024 was primarily due to the increase in same-store sales in the year ended January 6, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, marketing fees increased due to new center openings that became operational in the period from January 1, 2023 to January 6, 2024.

Other Revenue 

Other revenue increased $0.6 million or 4.9%, to $12.4 million during the year ended January 6, 2024, compared to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in other revenue during the year ended January 6, 2024 was primarily due to an 

50

 

increase in technology fees driven by new center openings that became operational during the period from January 1, 2023 to January 6, 2024 and an increase in corporate center revenues.

Costs and Expenses 

Cost of Revenue 

Cost of revenue increased $3.4 million or 5.8%, to $62.6 million during the year ended January 6, 2024, compared to $59.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to higher product sales in the current year period driven by new center openings that became operational during the period from January 1, 2023 to January 6, 2024. In addition, cost of revenue increased due to an additional offering of medical products to our centers for use in administering wax services that began in April 2022. 

Selling, General and Administrative 

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $0.5 million, or 0.9%, to $59.5 million during the year ended January 6, 2024, compared to $58.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in payroll and benefits, corporate marketing and expenses related to the pilot of laser hair removal, which was mostly offset by a decrease in professional and technology fee expenses. The increase in payroll and benefits expense was largely due to additional expense resulting from the modification of certain equity awards during the period. The decrease in professional fees was largely attributable to costs related to our securitization and secondary public offering transactions, which were completed during the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as certain costs related to being a newly public company. Technology expense declined as certain projects from fiscal year 2022 were completed in fiscal year 2023.

Advertising 

Advertising expenses increased $5.2 million, or 18.2%, to $33.9 million during the year ended January 6, 2024, compared to $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in advertising expense was attributable to the increase in marketing fee revenues as well as new marketing initiatives designed to drive more center traffic through acquisition of new guests and retention of existing guests. 

Depreciation and Amortization 

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended January 6, 2024 was largely consistent with the year ended December 31, 2022,  decreasing $0.1 million, or 0.3%, to $20.2 million during the year ended January 6, 2024, compared to $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Interest expense, net

Interest expense, net increased $3.1 million, or 13.0%, to $26.7 million during the year ended January 6, 2024, compared to $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average principal balances and interest rates on outstanding debt during the year ended January 6, 2024. This increase was partially offset by a $2.0 million loss on debt extinguishment recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 resulting from the repayment of our previous term loan in connection with the securitization transaction completed during that period as well as an increase in interest income from the Company’s short-term investments during the year ended January 6, 2024. 

Other (Income) Expense

We recognized income of $0.4 million during the year ended January 6, 2024 primarily related to the remeasurement of our TRA liability. During the year ended December 31, 2022 we recognized $56.2 million in expense related to the remeasurement of our TRA liability which primarily driven by the release of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the prior fiscal year. 

Income Tax Expense (Benefit)

We recognized an income tax expense of $6.2 million during the year ended January 6, 2024, compared to $53.2 million in income tax benefit for the year ended  December 31, 2022, an increase of $59.4 million or 111.7%. The income tax expense recognized in fiscal year 2023 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes, noncontrolling interests, and the tax effects of the tax receivable agreement. The income tax benefit recognized in fiscal year 2022 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax assets. Other drivers of the 2022 effective tax rate include non-taxable income attributable to noncontrolling interests, the tax receivable agreement and the tax effects of stock compensation.

We estimate that in future annual periods, our blended statutory tax rate, prior to valuation allowance consideration, will be approximately 21% of EWC Ventures income or loss before income taxes. This estimated blended statutory tax rate is based on the current capital structure, excludes discrete or other rate impacting adjustments which may impact the company’s income tax provision in the future and is based on our blended federal and state statutory tax rates reduced to exclude our non-taxable noncontrolling interests percentage. We expect this estimated blended statutory tax rate to increase as EWC Ventures Units and the corresponding 

51

 

shares of Class B common stock are exchanged for shares of Class A common stock because our nontaxable noncontrolling interests earnings will decrease.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In addition to our GAAP financial results, we believe the non-GAAP financial measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful in evaluating our performance. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental information purposes only and may be different from similarly titled metrics or measures presented by other companies. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP and a further discussion of how we use non-GAAP financial measures is provided below.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that EBITDA, which eliminates the impact of certain expenses that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance, provides useful information to investors to assess the performance of our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain additional non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing performance of our core operations. These items include non-cash equity-based compensation expense, non-cash gains and losses on remeasurement of our tax receivable agreement liability, contractual cash interest on our tax receivable agreement liability, transaction costs and other one-time expenses. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance in addition to EBITDA because it eliminates the impact of other items that we believe reduce the comparability of our underlying core business performance from period to period and is therefore useful to our investors in comparing the core performance of our business from period to period. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We measure liquidity in terms of our ability to fund the cash requirements of our business operations, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and debt service with cash flows from operations and other sources of funding. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash provided from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, proceeds from our Class A-2 Notes and Variable Funding Notes and proceeds from the issuance of equity to our members. We had cash and cash equivalents of $52.7 million as of January 6, 2024. 

52

 

Future payments under the TRA with respect to the purchase of EWC Ventures Units which occurred as part of the IPO and through January 6, 2024 are currently expected to be $206.6 million. Such amounts will be paid when such deferred tax assets are realized as a reduction to income taxes due or payable. That is, payments under the TRA are only expected to be made in periods following the filing of a tax return in which we are able to utilize certain tax benefits to reduce our cash taxes paid to a taxing authority. The impact of any changes in the projected obligations under the TRA as a result of changes in the geographic mix of the Company’s earnings, changes in tax legislation and tax rates or other factors that may impact the Company’s tax savings will be reflected in other expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the change occurs.  

We believe that our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations and growth strategy for at least the next twelve months. Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, capital expenditures to grow our network of centers, debt servicing costs, and general corporate needs. We have in the past, and may in the future, refinance our existing indebtedness with new debt arrangements and utilize a portion of borrowings to return capital to our stockholders. 

We expect capital expenditures for the year ending January 4, 2025 (“fiscal year 2024”) to be approximately $1.5 million to $2.0 million. The majority of these capital expenditures will be to support investments in technology, including enhancements to data infrastructure and our e-commerce platform, as well as general investments in our corporate-owned centers. We anticipate our cash on hand and future cash flows from operations will provide the funds needed to meet our anticipated capital expenditure needs in fiscal year 2024.

We also have contractual obligations, including non-cancellable operating leases for office space and various retail locations, with terms expiring through 2032. Future maturities of our operating lease liabilities as of January 6, 2024 is presented within the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements (Note 10—Leases), included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. 

Additionally, we have various contractual commitments with third parties whereby we expect to pay $20.9 million in fiscal year 2024, through cash on hand and operating cash flows.

Our assessment of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and our future capital requirements could vary because of many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to acquire new centers and expand into new markets, and the expansion of sales and marketing activities. We may, in the future, enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.

Securitized Financing Facility

On April 6, 2022, the Master Issuer completed a securitization transaction pursuant to which it issued $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of  Class A-2 Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Class A-2 Notes were used to repay the 2026 Term Loan, fund certain reserve amounts under the securitized financing facility, pay the transaction costs associated with the securitized financing facility, and fund a one-time special dividend to stockholders. 

In connection with the issuance of the Class A-2 Notes, the Master Issuer also entered into (i) a revolving financing facility that allows for the issuance of up to $40.0 million in Variable Funding Notes, and certain letters of credit and (2) an advance funding facility with BofA, whereby BofA and any other advance funding provider thereunder will, in certain specified circumstances, make certain debt service advances and collateral protection advances. The Variable Funding Notes were undrawn at closing and as of January 6, 2024. The Class A-2 Notes and the Variable Funding Notes are referred to collectively as the “Notes.”

The Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of the Class A-2 Notes under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the transfers of the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. The Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Base Indenture, dated April 6, 2022 (the “Indenture”), including events tied to failure to maintain a stated debt service coverage ratio, the sum of system-wide sales being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events (including in certain cases a change of control of EWC Ventures, LLC), an event of default and the failure to repay or refinance the Notes on the applicable anticipated repayment date. The Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective and certain judgments.

For additional information regarding our long-term debt activity, see Note to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 8—Long-term debt) contained elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. 

Tax Receivable Agreement 

Generally, we are required under the TRA, which is described more fully in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure—We are required to pay the EWC Ventures' pre-IPO members for certain tax benefits we may claim, and the amounts we may pay could be significant” included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K to make payments to the EWC Ventures pre-IPO members that are generally equal to 85% of the applicable cash tax savings, if any, that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize, calculated using certain assumptions) as a result of (i) increases in our allocable share of certain existing tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the Company and adjustments to the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the Company, in each case as a result of (a) the purchases of EWC Ventures Units (along with the corresponding shares of our Class B common stock) from certain of the EWC Ventures Post-IPO Members using a portion of the net proceeds from the initial and secondary public offerings or in any future offering or (b) Share Exchanges and Cash Exchanges by the EWC Ventures pre-IPO members (or their transferees or other assignees) in connection with or after the initial public offering, (ii) our utilization of certain tax attributes of the Blocker Companies (including the Blocker Companies' allocable share of certain existing tax basis of EWC Ventures' assets) and (iii) certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA. 

Subject to the discussion in the following paragraph below, payments under the TRA will occur only after we have filed our U.S. federal and state income tax returns and realized the cash tax savings from the favorable tax attributes. Future payments under the TRA in respect of future purchases of EWC Ventures Units, Share Exchanges and Cash Exchanges would be in addition to these amounts. Payments under the TRA are computed by reference to realized tax benefits from attributes subject to the TRA and are expected to be funded by tax distributions made to us by our subsidiaries similar to how cash taxes would be funded to the extent these attributes did not exist. To the extent we are unable to make payments under the TRA for any reason (including because the Company’s securitized financing facility restricts the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us), under the terms of the TRA such payments will be deferred and accrue interest until paid. If we are unable to make payments due to insufficient funds, such payments may be deferred indefinitely while accruing interest until paid, which could negatively impact our results of operations and could also affect our liquidity in future periods in which such deferred payments are made. 

Under the TRA, as a result of certain types of transactions and other factors, including a transaction resulting in a change of control, we may also be required to make payments to the EWC Ventures pre-IPO members in amounts equal to the present value of future payments we are obligated to make under the TRA. If the payments under the TRA are accelerated, we may be required to raise additional debt or equity to fund such payments. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the TRA for any reason (including because the Company’s securitized financing facility restricts the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us), under the terms of the TRA Agreement such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. If we are unable to make payments due to insufficient funds to make such payments, such payments may be deferred indefinitely while accruing interest until paid, which could negatively impact our results of operations and could also affect our liquidity in future periods in which such deferred payments are made.

Operating Activities 

During the year ended January 6, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $55.6 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $44.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $11.3 million. This improvement was largely attributable to a decrease in working capital in fiscal year 2023 compared to a working capital increase in 2022 as well as our improved operating results in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. The decrease in working capital in 2023 was primarily attributable to a decrease of $2.3 million in inventory. The increase in cash flows from operations was partially offset by an increase in cash interest paid due to higher average principal balances and interest rates on outstanding debt in 2023 compared to 2022.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.

The critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our financial statements are described below.

Revenue Recognition: Revenue from contracts with customers consists primarily of product sales, royalties, marketing fees and other fees resulting from our franchise agreements.

Product sales primarily include the sale of wax, wholesale products consumed in the application of wax services and retail merchandise to franchisees, as well as retail merchandise sold in corporate-owned centers. Revenue on product sales is recognized when control transfers. Generally, customers take control when the risk of loss, title and insurable risks have transferred to the customer.

Royalty fees are earned based on a percentage of franchisees’ gross sales, net of retail product sales, as defined in the applicable franchise agreement. Our franchise agreement royalties represent sales-based royalties that are related entirely to our performance obligation under the applicable franchise agreement and are recognized as franchise sales occur.

55

 

Marketing fees are primarily earned based on a percentage of franchisees’ gross sales, net of retail product sales and a fixed fee for search engine optimization and marketing services.

Franchise fees consist primarily of revenues earned from the delivery of services to franchisees over the franchise license term. The Company’s primary performance obligations under the franchise license center are granting the use of the European Wax Center trademarks, system, training, preopening assistance and operating assistance in exchange for franchise fees. The rights to use the Company’s intellectual property and all other services the Company provides under the applicable franchise agreement are highly interrelated, not distinct within the contract, and therefore accounted for under ASC 606 as a single performance obligation, which is satisfied by granting certain rights to use our intellectual property over the term of each franchise agreement.

Initial franchise fees paid by the franchisee are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis commencing at contract inception through the end of the franchise license term. Franchise agreements generally have terms of ten years. These agreements also convey one extension term up to ten years, depending on contract terms and if certain conditions are met. Amounts collected in advance for franchise fees are recorded as deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Inventory Valuation: Our inventories are substantially comprised of wax, wholesale products consumed in the application of wax services and European Wax Center branded products including in-grown hair serums, exfoliates, body washes, lotions, and creams. Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the FIFO method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We record adjustments to our inventory reserves if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand, age of inventory, and analysis of historical experience. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, future results may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates. We do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory reserves.

Goodwill: Goodwill is recognized for the excess of the fair value of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination and is not subject to amortization. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Factors that could trigger an impairment test include, but are not limited to, underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends. 

Goodwill has historically been tested for impairment on October 1 of each fiscal year, which in past years has been at the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter. In fiscal year 2023 we changed the date of our annual impairment test to the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter, which for fiscal year 2023 was also October 1. The fiscal calendar we follow results in shifting quarter-and year-end dates each fiscal year and in certain years October 1 will fall into our third fiscal quarter. This change was made in order to maintain consistent timing of our annual impairment test each year and is therefore considered to be preferable. We do not consider this to be a material change in the application of an accounting principle as the new and old testing dates are in very close proximity varying only by a small number of days each fiscal year. 

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at a reporting unit level. We have determined that we have one reporting unit which is the same as our sole operating segment. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, or if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative impairment test. This test identifies both the existence of and the amount of goodwill impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in amount equal to that excess, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. It is possible that changes in circumstances or changes in management’s judgments, assumptions and estimates could result in an impairment charge of a portion or all of its goodwill. 

When performing a quantitative impairment test we make various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of our reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow models and valuations based on earnings multiples for guideline public companies and transactions in our reporting unit’s industry peer group, when externally quoted market prices are not readily available. Discounted cash flow models are highly reliant on various assumptions, including projected business results, long-term growth factors and discount rate. Management judgment is involved in estimating these variables, and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events. We perform sensitivity analyses by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of the long-term growth rate and discount rate estimates.

We performed our annual goodwill impairment test using the quantitative approach as of October 1, 2023 and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. The impairment test concluded that the reporting unit had a fair value in excess of its respective carrying amount. We believe our use of significant assumptions within our valuation models are reasonable estimates of likely future events.  In addition, we also considered our market capitalization relative to our net assets as of the testing date. Subsequent to this annual impairment test, no additional indications of an impairment were identified.

Significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies include estimates of future projected business results (principally revenue and EBITDA), long-term growth rates, and the discount rate. We performed sensitivity analyses by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of long-term growth rate and discount rate estimates. Significant assumptions utilized in the impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of 2023 included a weighted-average cost of capital of 12.3%, and a terminal growth rate of 4.0%. Based on the sensitivity analysis performed on these two key assumptions in the discounted cash flow model, a 100 basis point decrease in the long-term growth factor assumption or a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would not have resulted in a fair value below the reporting unit’s carrying value. 

No goodwill impairment charges were recognized for goodwill for fiscal years 2023, 2022 or 2021. For additional information related to our goodwill, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 6—Goodwill and Intangible Assets, net) contained elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Intangible Assets: Intangible assets primarily consist of franchisee relationships, trade names and reacquired area representative rights. Franchisee relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. Reacquired rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining expected term of the agreement with the area representative. The initial term of the area representative agreements is ten years with an additional ten-year renewal at the option of the area representative. Trade names were deemed to have an indefinite life. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Factors that could trigger an impairment test include, but are not limited to, underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets have historically been tested for impairment on October 1 of each fiscal year, which in past years has been at the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter. In fiscal year 2023, we changed the date of our annual impairment test to the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter, which for fiscal year 2023 was also October 1. The fiscal calendar we follow results in shifting quarter and year-end dates each fiscal year and in certain years October 1 will fall into our third fiscal quarter. This change was made in order to maintain consistent timing of our annual impairment test each year and is therefore considered to be preferable. We do not consider this to be a material change in the application of an accounting principle as the new and old testing dates are in very close proximity varying only by a small number of days each fiscal year. 

Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including our trade names, are tested for impairment at the unit of account. We may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, or if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative impairment test. If the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference. If an intangible asset that is not being amortized is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, that asset is tested for impairment. After recognition of the impairment, if any, the asset is amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization.

When a quantitative analysis is performed, we test these assets using a “relief-from-royalty” valuation method to determine the fair value. Significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, future projected business results, growth rates, the discount rate for a market participant, and royalty rates. 

We performed our annual impairment test for our trade name intangible asset using the quantitative approach as of October 1, 2023 and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. The impairment test concluded that the trade name had a fair value in excess of its respective carrying amount. We believe our use of significant assumptions within our valuation models are reasonable estimates of likely future events. Subsequent to this annual impairment test, no additional indications of an impairment were identified. 

Significant assumptions inherent in the relief-from-royalty method include estimates of future projected business results (principally revenue), long-term growth rates, royalty rates and the discount rate. We performed sensitivity analyses by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of long-term growth rate, royalty rate and discount rate estimates. Significant assumptions utilized in the impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of 2023 included a discount rate of 12.8%, a royalty rate of 5.0% and a terminal growth rate of 4.0%. Based on the sensitivity analysis performed on these three key assumptions in the relief-from-royalty model, a 100 basis point decrease in the long-term growth factor and royalty rate assumptions, or a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would not have resulted in a fair value below the trade name's carrying value.

No impairment charges were recognized for our intangible assets for fiscal years 2023, 2022 or 2021. For additional information related to our intangible assets, see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 6—Goodwill and Intangible Assets, net) contained elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Income taxes: We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”), using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are provided on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of its assets and liabilities. Such net tax effects of temporary differences are reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as deferred tax assets and liabilities and are measured by applying the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when the Company believes that it is more-likely- than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In accordance with ASC 740 we assess whether it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. The realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in the applicable carryback or carryforward periods. We consider the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative losses as well as the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, historical and forecasted taxable income (exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards) in our assessment. In evaluating such projections, the Company considers its history of profitability and cumulative earnings/losses, the competitive environment, and general economic conditions. In addition, the Company considers the time frame over which it would take to utilize the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration. To the extent the Company determines that, based on the weight of available evidence, all or a portion of its valuation allowance is no longer necessary, the Company will recognize the change in the period such determination occurs. It is possible that such change to the Company’s valuation allowance could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and/or financial position.

Changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect our actual tax results, and future business results may affect the amount of our deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of our deferred tax assets over time. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, particularly with respect to changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in previous analyses. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and/or financial position.

ASC 740 prescribes a two-step approach for the recognition and measurement of tax benefits associated with the positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. The Company has reviewed and will continue to review the conclusions reached regarding uncertain tax positions, which may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on ongoing analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. To the extent that the Company’s assessment of the conclusions reached regarding uncertain tax positions changes as a result of the evaluation of new information, such change in estimate will be recorded in the period in which such determination is made. The Company reports income tax-related interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions, if applicable, as a component of income tax expense.

Tax Receivable Agreement: We entered into the TRA with the EWC Ventures Pre-IPO Members that provides for the payment by the Company to the EWC Ventures Pre-IPO Members of 85% of the benefits, if any, that the Company realizes, or is deemed to realize (calculated using certain assumptions), as a result of (i) increases in our allocable share of certain existing tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the Company and adjustments to the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the Company, in each case as a result of (a) the purchases of EWC Ventures Units (along with the corresponding shares of our Class B common stock) from certain of the EWC Ventures Post-IPO Members using a portion of the net proceeds from the initial and secondary public offerings or in any future offering or (b) Share Exchanges and Cash Exchanges by the EWC Ventures Pre-IPO Members (or their transferees or other assignees) in connection with or after the initial public offering, (ii) our utilization of certain tax attributes of the Blocker Companies (including the Blocker Companies’ allocable share of certain existing tax basis of EWC Ventures’ assets) and (iii) certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA. We record liabilities for amounts payable under the TRA in the period in which the payment is deemed to be probable.

As of January 6, 2024, the Company recorded a liability of  $206.6 million for expected future payments under the TRA with respect to the purchase of EWC Ventures Units which occurred as part of the initial public offering and through January 6, 2024.

Payments made under the TRA represent payments that otherwise would have been made to taxing authorities in the absence of attributes obtained by us as a result of exchanges by the EWC Ventures Pre-IPO Members. Such amounts will be paid only when a cash tax savings is realized as a result of attributes subject to the TRA. That is, payments under the TRA are only expected to be made in periods following the filing of a tax return in which we are able to utilize certain tax benefits to reduce our cash taxes paid to a taxing authority. Amounts payable under the TRA are contingent upon, among other things, the generation of future taxable income. The projection of future taxable income involves significant judgment. In projecting future taxable income, we consider our historical results and incorporate certain assumptions including the growth rate of the Company and the amount, character, and timing of the taxable income in the future. Actual taxable income may differ from our estimates, which could significantly impact the liability under the TRA. The impact of any changes in the projected obligations under the TRA as a result of changes in the geographic mix of the Company’s earnings, changes in tax legislation and tax rates or other factors that may impact the Company’s tax savings will be reflected in income before taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the change occurs.

JOBS Act 

The Company is an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”) and may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with those standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This may make it difficult to compare our financial results with the financial results of another public company that is either not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company that has chosen not to take advantage of the extended transition period exemptions because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
