Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Overview We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutic compounds to treat diseases with high unmet needs through the inhibition of the complement system, which is an integral component of the immune system. We believe that this approach has the potential to effectively control diseases with high unmet need and that are driven by excessive complement activation. We currently have two marketed drugs that target C3, the central protein in the complement cascade: SYFOVRE (pegcetacoplan injection), approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in February 2023 for the treatment of geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration, or GA; and EMPAVELI (pegcetacoplan), approved by the FDA in May 2021 for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH. We believe SYFOVRE has the potential to be the standard of care for patients with GA, a disease that affects an estimated 1.5 million people in the United States. While we have exclusive, worldwide commercialization rights for intravitreal pegcetacoplan, we intend to focus our commercialization efforts in the U.S. and explore international expansion in select markets, including Australia, where we received marketing approval in January 2025. For the year ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, we generated $611.9 million and $275.2 million in U.S. net product revenue from sales of SYFOVRE. We are also developing a next-generation therapy by combining SYFOVRE treatment with APL-3007, which is a small interfering RNA, or siRNA, aimed at comprehensively blocking complement activity in the retina and the choroid. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 multi-dose trial in patients with GA in the second quarter of 2025. We believe that EMPAVELI has the potential to be a best-in-class treatment for a range of indications with high unmet needs. We have exclusive U.S. commercialization rights for EMPAVELI, and our collaboration partner, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (Publ), or Sobi, has exclusive ex-U.S. commercialization rights for systemic pegcetacoplan outside of the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we generated $98.1 million and $91.0 million, respectively, in U.S. net product revenue from sales of EMPAVELI for PNH and received $18.4 million and $10.0 million, respectively, in royalties from our collaboration partner, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (Publ), or Sobi, which has exclusive ex-U.S. commercialization rights for systemic pegcetacoplan outside of the United States. We have commercialization rights for systemic pegcetacoplan in the United States. The next indications we are pursuing with EMPAVELI are C3 glomerulopathy, or C3G, and primary immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, or IC-MPGN, which together affect an estimated 5,000 people in the United States. We submitted a supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, to the FDA in early 2025, following the positive results from the Phase 3 VALIANT trial investigating systemic pegcetacoplan in adolescent and adult patients with naive and post-transplant recurrence C3G and IC-MPGN that we reported in August 2024. Importantly, the VALIANT study demonstrated positive effects on the three key markers of disease at six months: a 68% reduction in proteinuria in C3G and IC-MPGN patients compared to placebo (p < 0.0001), the primary endpoint. Results were consistent across all subgroups, including disease type, age, and transplant status. Additionally, pegcetacoplan-treated patients achieved stabilization of kidney function (nominal p=0.03), as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate, and a substantial proportion of patients achieved a reduction in C3c staining intensity (nominal p<0.0001). Data also demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability results, consistent with pegcetacoplan established profile. Additionally, in February 2025, Sobi received validation for its indication extension application for C3G and IC-MPGN from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. We plan to initiate two new Phase 3 clinical trials with EMPAVELI in the second half of 2025 for the treatment of primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS, and delayed graft function, or DGF. Both FSGS and DGF are both rare, severe nephrology conditions with no approved therapies and in which complement overactivation plays a significant role. Sobi is also leading the development of systemic pegcetacoplan for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, or HSCT-TMA, in hematology under the collaboration. Finally, we are developing new product candidates to further advance our pipeline. Through our collaboration with Beam Therapeutics, Inc., or Beam, we have commenced pre-clinical studies for a treatment targeting the neonatal Fc receptor, orFcRn, which has the potential to be a first-in-class gene editing treatment for future target indications with one-time dosing. We are also developing other programs with our proprietary in-house capabilities. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through approximately $2.6 billion in net proceeds from public and private offerings of our common stock and convertible securities, $401.5 million in payments and royalties from Sobi pursuant to our 94 Table of Contents collaboration agreement, $532.5 million under various credit arrangements, including with Sixth Street Lending Partners, or Sixth Street, and SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group, or SFJ, and $98.8 million relating to the unwinding of certain capped call transactions in March 2024, as well as from the proceeds of our operations. To date, we have exchanged $425.4 million and converted $0.7 million of aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Notes for shares of our common stock. Our non-dilutive financing activities, which include the Sixth Street Financing Agreement (as defined below), the repayment of our remaining obligations to SFJ and the partial unwinding of our capped call transactions, increased the amount of cash available to us through 2025 by approximately $270.0 million, with the potential for us to access additional short-term liquidity through a second draw of $100.0 million under the Credit Facility (as defined below). We have incurred significant annual net operating losses in each year since our inception and expect to continue to incur net operating losses for at least this year. Our net losses were $197.9 million, $528.6 million, and $652.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $3.0 billion. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant commercialization expenses related to sales, marketing, medical affairs, manufacturing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure associated with the commercialization of EMPAVELI for the treatment of PNH and other indications and the commercialization of SYFOVRE for the treatment of GA. In addition, we expect to continue to incur these expenses if and as we continue to develop and conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials of pegcetacoplan and our other product candidates; initiate and continue research and preclinical and clinical development efforts for any future product candidates; seek to identify and develop additional product candidates for complement-dependent diseases; seek regulatory and marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any; establish sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure to commercialize any additional products for which we may obtain marketing approval; require the manufacture of larger quantities of product candidates for clinical development and, potentially, commercialization; maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; hire and retain additional personnel, such as clinical, quality control, regulatory and scientific personnel; add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and add equipment and physical infrastructure to support our research and development programs and commercialization. Financing Agreement and Credit Facility On May 13, 2024, we entered into a financing agreement, or the Sixth Street Financing Agreement, with certain of our material subsidiaries as guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto, or the Lenders, and Sixth Street Lending Partners, as the administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders. The Sixth Street Financing Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan facility of up to $475.0 million, or the Credit Facility, consisting of an initial draw of $375.0 million at closing and a potential additional $100.0 million draw at our option upon satisfaction of a $50.0 million minimum cash requirement and a requirement that our trailing three-month sales of SYFOVRE is at least $180.0 million prior to the $100.0 million draw. We can exercise the option for the additional $100.0 million draw through September 30, 2025, assuming such requirements are met. The Credit Facility matures on May 13, 2030 (the Maturity Date ) and bears interest at (i) in the case of SOFR Loans, an annual rate equal to 3-month Term SOFR (subject to 1.00% floor), plus 5.75%, and (ii) in the case of Base Rate Loans, an annual rate equal to the base rate as defined in the agreement (subject to 2.00% floor), plus 4.75%. Certain additional commitment and undrawn amount fees are also payable in connection with the Credit Facility. The net proceeds from the initial draw of the Credit Facility were approximately $358.2 million, net of $16.8 million of issuance costs. We used the majority of the proceeds of the $375.0 million draw at closing to buy out our remaining obligations to SFJ, in the amount of approximately $326.5 million. The Credit Facility does not provide for scheduled amortization payments during the term. All principal will be due on the Maturity Date. We have the right to prepay loans under the Credit Facility at any time. We are required to repay loans under the Credit Facility with proceeds from certain asset sales, condemnation events and extraordinary receipts, subject, in some cases, to reinvestment rights. Repayments are subject to a prepayment premium. Repayments may be made after the first year of the loan and are subject to a prepayment premium up to 3% depending on timing. All obligations under the Sixth Street Financing Agreement are secured on a first-priority basis, subject to certain exceptions, by security interests in substantially all of our assets and assets of our material subsidiaries, including our intellectual property, and are guaranteed by our material subsidiaries, including foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The Sixth Street Financing Agreement contains customary covenants, including, without limitation, a financial covenant to maintain liquidity of at least $50.0 million if our market capitalization is below $3.0 billion, and negative covenants that, subject to 95 Table of Contents certain exceptions, restrict indebtedness, liens, investments (including acquisitions), fundamental changes, asset sales and licensing transactions, dividends, modifications to material agreements, payment of subordinated indebtedness, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. Among other permissions, we are permitted, on terms and conditions set forth on the Sixth Street Financing Agreement, to enter into a separate asset-based financing arrangement with a third party in an amount of up to $100.0 million, which amount is increased to $200.0 million upon certain sales or market capitalization thresholds, and to have outstanding convertible unsecured notes in an amount equal to the greater of $400.0 million and 10% of our market capitalization, but not to exceed $600.0 million. We are subject to restrictions on sales and licensing transactions with respect to our core intellectual property, defined to include SYFOVRE, EMPAVELI, and other pegcetacoplan product assets, subject to certain exceptions, including certain transactions related to areas outside the United States and Europe. The Sixth Street Financing Agreement also contains certain events of default after which loans under the Credit Facility may be due and payable immediately, including payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings, cross-defaults to certain other agreements, judgments against us and our subsidiaries, and change of control. SFJ Agreement In 2019, we entered into a development funding agreement (as amended, the SFJ agreement ) with SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group ( SFJ ), under which SFJ agreed to provide funding to us to support the development of pegcetacoplan for the treatment of patients with PNH. Under the SFJ agreement, SFJ paid us an aggregate of $140.0 million between June 2019 and January 2020. Following regulatory approval for the use of systemic pegcetacoplan as a treatment for PNH by the FDA in May 2021 and by the EMA in December 2021, we became obligated to pay SFJ an aggregate of $460.0 million in payments between 2021 and 2027. We paid SFJ an aggregate of $94.0 million through March 31, 2024. On May 13, 2024, we used proceeds from the Sixth Street Financing Agreement to buy out our remaining obligations owed to SFJ, in the amount of approximately $326.5 million. The buyout of the SFJ development liability eliminated the remaining $366.0 million in payments to SFJ, including a total of approximately $200.0 million payable in 2024 and 2025. Convertible Notes On September 16, 2019, we completed a private offering of convertible notes, or the 2019 Convertible Notes, with an aggregate principal amount of $220.0 million issued pursuant to an indenture, or the Indenture, with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2019 Convertible Notes were approximately $212.9 million after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and commissions of $6.6 million and offering expenses of $0.5 million. We used $28.4 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2019 Convertible Notes to pay the cost of the capped call transactions in September 2019 described below. On May 12, 20 20, we issued convertible notes, or the 2020 Convertible Notes, with an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2020 Convertible Notes were approximately $322.9 million after deducting the purchasers discounts and commission of $5.7 million and offering expenses of $0.3 million. We used $43.1 million of the net proceeds from the sale to pay the cost of the additional capped call transactions in May 2020 described below. The 2019 Conve rtible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes are referred to together as the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of 3.5% per year payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2020. The Convertible Notes will mature on September 15, 2026, unless converted earlier, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 25.3405 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $39.4625 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. In addition, following certain events that occur prior to the maturity date or if we deliver a notice of redemption, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such corporate event or a notice of redemption, as the case may be, in certain circumstances as provided in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, or the Indenture. Prior to March 15, 2026, the Convertible Notes are convertible only under the following circumstances: during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; 96 Table of Contents during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes for each such trading day was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; if we call any or all of the Convertible Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or upon the occurrence of corporate events specified in the Indenture. The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes was not triggered as of December 31, 2024. On or after March 15, 2026 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, holders may convert the Convertible Notes at any time regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. As of September 20, 2023, we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the Convertible Notes, at our option, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide a notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption. The redemption price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. If we call any Convertible Notes for redemption, it will constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to such Convertible Notes, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of such Notes, if converted in connection with the redemption, will be increased in certain circumstances. We have not called for redemption any of the Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2024. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the Indenture, prior to maturity, subject to certain conditions, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In January 2021, July 2021 and July 2022, we entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements to modify the conversion terms with certain holders of our Convertible Notes. Under the terms of these exchange agreements, in January 2021, July 2021 and July 2022, the holders exchanged approximately $126.1 million of 2019 Convertible Notes, $201.1 million of 2019 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes, and $98.1 million of 2020 Convertible Notes, respectively, in aggregate principal amount held by them for an aggregate of 3,906,869 shares, 5,992,217 shares and 3,027,018 shares, respectively, of common stock we issued. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 470-20, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options, or ASC 470-20, we accounted for the exchange as an induced conversion based on the short period of time the conversion offer was open and the substantive conversion feature offer. We accounted for the conversion of the debt as an inducement by expensing the fair value of the shares that were issued in excess of the original terms of the Convertible Notes. The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes was triggered as of December 31, 2023, and as a result the Convertible Notes were convertible at the option of the holders until March 31, 2024. No Convertible Notes were converted during this period. The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes was not triggered as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024 we held in treasury Convertible Notes in principal amount of $425.4 million which notes had not been cancelled. Capped Call Transactions In September 2019 and May 2020, concurrently with the pricing of the 2019 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes, respectively, we entered into capped call transactions with two counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, in the event that the market price per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, is greater than the strike price of the capped call transactions, which is initially $39.4625, the conversion price of the Convertible Notes, and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of such Convertible Notes. If, however, the market price per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds $63.14, the cap price of the 97 Table of Contents capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions. Collaboration Agreement with Sobi On October 27, 2020, we entered into the Sobi collaboration agreement, concerning the development and commercialization of pegcetacoplan and specified other structurally and functionally similar compstatin analogues or derivatives for use systemically or for local non-ophthalmological administration, collectively referred to as the licensed products. We granted Sobi an exclusive (subject to certain rights retained by us), sublicensable license of certain patent rights and know-how to develop and commercialize licensed products in all countries outside of the United States. We retained the right to commercialize licensed products in the United States, and, subject to specified limitations, to develop licensed products worldwide for commercialization in the United States. Under the Sobi collaboration agreement, Sobi made an upfront payment of $250.0 million in November 2020, and agreed to pay up to an aggregate of $915.0 million upon the achievement of specified one-time regulatory and commercial milestone events, including a $50.0 million milestone payable following the first regulatory and reimbursement approval of systemic pegcetacoplan in any major European country, and to reimburse us for up to $80.0 million in development costs. Since contract inception, we have recognized $65.0 million in contra-research and development expenses and waived the remaining $15.0 million in connection with the decision to discontinue the CAD program. The European Commission approved systemic Aspaveli (pegcetacoplan) for the treatment of adults with PNH in December 2021. In March 2022, we earned a $50.0 million payment from Sobi related to the first regulatory and reimbursement milestone in Europe, which we received in April 2022. We are also entitled to receive tiered, double-digit royalties (ranging from high teens to high twenties) on sales of licensed products outside of the United States, subject to customary deductions and third-party payment obligations, until the latest to occur of: (i) expiration of the last-to-expire of specified licensed patent rights; (ii) expiration of regulatory exclusivity; and (iii) ten (10) years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product, in each case on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis. We remain responsible for our license fee obligations (including royalty obligations) to the University of Pennsylvania. Financial Operations Overview Revenue Our revenues consist of product sales of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE, and revenues derived from our collaboration arrangement with Sobi. Revenue is recognized when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer. An asset is transferred when, or as, the customer obtains control of that asset. For performance obligations that are satisfied over time, we recognize revenue using an input or output measure of progress that best depicts the satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation. Product Revenues Product revenue is derived from our sales of our commercial products, EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE, in the United States . Licensing and Collaboration Revenue Licensing and other revenue is derived from our collaboration agreement with Sobi concerning the development and commercialization of pegcetacoplan and specified other compstatin analogues or derivatives for use systemically or for local non-ophthalmic administration. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists primarily of costs associated with the manufacturing of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE, royalties owed to our licensor for such sales, and certain period costs. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include: employee-related expenses including salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation expense related to individuals performing research and development activities; 98 Table of Contents expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, that conduct clinical trials and research and development activities on our behalf, and contract manufacturing organizations that manufacture quantities of drug supplies for both our preclinical studies and clinical trials; the cost of consultants, including share-based compensation expense; and various other expenses incident to the management of our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. We have not provided program costs since inception because historically we have not tracked or recorded our research and development expenses by program. The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. Accordingly, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of these product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from pegcetacoplan or any other potential product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing therapeutics, including the uncertainties of: establishing an appropriate safety profile in preclinical studies; successful enrollment in, and completion of clinical trials; receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; launching commercial sales of the products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and an acceptable safety profile of the products following approval. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect research and development costs to increase for the foreseeable future as our product candidate development programs progress. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses including salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation, consulting and professional fees, marketing and advertising costs, medical affairs and regulatory costs associated with our commercial products, facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters, and fees for accounting and consulting services. Marketing and advertising costs include marketing literature, promotional activities, conferences and seminars, branding and sponsorships. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities, potential commercialization of our product candidates and costs of operating as a public company. Critical Accounting Estimates This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the 99 Table of Contents basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. Product Revenues We recognize revenue from product sales at the net sales price which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and reflects each of these as a reduction to the revenue. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from estimates, we may need to adjust its estimates, which would affect net revenue in the period of adjustment. The following are the variable considerations with critical accounting estimates: Returns : Consistent with industry practice, we offer SPs and SDs limited product return rights for shipment errors or expiring or defective products; provided that the return is within a specified period around the product expiration date as set forth in the applicable individual distribution agreement. We do not allow product returns for product that has been dispensed to a patient. As we receive inventory reports from SPs and SDs and have visibility into the inventory distribution channel, we are able to make a reasonable estimate of future potential product returns based on this on-hand channel inventory data and sell-through data obtained from SPs and SDs. In arriving at our estimate for product returns, we also consider historical product returns (to the extent available) and the underlying product demand. GPO Rebates : Commercial rebates are based on (i) our estimates of end-user purchases through a GPO, (ii) the corresponding contractual rebate percentage tier we expect each GPO to achieve, and (iii) our estimates of the impact of any prospective rebate program changes made by us. Credit Card Fees: SDs will sell downstream to customers who may pay for product via credit card. The Company will reimburse its SDs for the credit card fees incurred as a result of SDs accepting credit cards as a form of payment from the downstream customers. Credit card fees are recorded as an offset to revenue based on the average aggregate credit card rate as a percentage of SD sales at the time revenue from the sale is recognized. Inventory Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs include third-party contract manufacturing, third-party packaging services, labor, overhead, and freight. We perform an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period, and write down any excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. Such impairment charges, should they occur, are recorded within cost of sales. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by management. Provisions for potentially obsolete or slow-moving inventory, are made based on the Company analysis of product dating, inventory levels, historical obsolescence and future sales forecasts. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional write-downs of inventory may be required which would be recorded as a cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Accrued Research and Development Expenses As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing quotations and contracts, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by CROs and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced. 100 Table of Contents We base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with CROs and CMOs. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our CROs and CMOs will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time-period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting expense amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred. Results of Operations Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, together with the dollar increase or decrease and percentage change in those items: Year Ended December 31, Change Change (in thousands) 2024 2023 $ % Revenue: Product Revenue, net $ 709,954 $ 366,281 $ 343,673 94 % Licensing and other revenue 71,413 30,310 41,103 136 % Total revenue: 781,367 396,591 384,776 97 % Operating expenses: Cost of sales 117,723 58,510 59,213 101 % Research and development 327,570 354,387 (26,817 ) (8 %) Selling, general and administrative 501,053 500,815 238 0 % Total operating expenses 946,346 913,712 32,634 4 % Net operating loss (164,979 ) (517,121 ) 352,142 (68 %) Loss on extinguishment of development liability (1,949 ) (1,949 ) (100 %) Interest income 12,773 20,933 (8,160 ) (39 %) Interest expense (40,391 ) (29,581 ) (10,810 ) 37 % Other expense, net (2,170 ) (727 ) (1,443 ) 198 % Net loss before taxes (196,716 ) (526,496 ) 329,780 (63 %) Income tax expense 1,162 2,132 (970 ) (45 %) Net loss $ (197,878 ) $ (528,628 ) $ 330,750 (63 %) Product Revenue, Net Our product revenue, net is derived from sales of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE sales in the United States. We recognized $710.0 million and $366.3 million of net product revenue as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net product revenue of $710.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, consists of $98.1 million in net product revenue from sales of EMPAVELI and $611.9 million in net product revenue from sales of SYFOVRE. The net product revenue of $366.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, consists of $91.0 million in net product revenue from sales of EMPAVELI and $275.2 million in net product revenue from sales of SYFOVRE. Licensing and Other Revenue Licensing and other revenue was $71.4 million and $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Licensing and other revenue of $71.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 consisted of $53.0 million in revenue from product supplied to Sobi, and $18.4 million in royalty revenue from Sobi. Licensing and other revenue of $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted of $10.0 million in revenue from product supplied to Sobi, $15.3 million in royalty revenue from Sobi and $5.0 million from collaboration with Sobi. Cost of Sales Cost of sales was $117.7 million and $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cost of sales was primarily driven by a $6.1 million increase due to higher volume from commercial sales and product provided under our patient assistance programs, a $27.4 million increase due to higher volume of product supplied to Sobi, a $6.0 million increase in royalty expense, a $11.7 million increase in expenses incurred related to excess, obsolete or scrapped inventory, and $8.0 million incurred in connection with the termination of minimum purchase obligations. 101 Table of Contents In addition, prior to receiving FDA approval for EMPAVELI on May 14, 2021, the costs associated with the manufacture of EMPAVELI inventory were expensed as incurred as research and development expense. This resulted in inventory being sold during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 for which a portion of the costs had been previously expensed prior to FDA approval. We expect this to continue to impact the cost of sales as the remaining pre-FDA inventory is sold to customers. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, the remaining pre-FDA approved inventory was $19.5 million and $26.3 million, which primarily consisted of raw materials. Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, together with the dollar increase or decrease and percentage change in those items: (In thousands) Year Ended December 31, Change Change 2024 2023 $ % Program-specific external costs: PNH $ 17,879 $ 19,504 $ (1,625 ) (8 %) C3G & IC-MPGN 34,507 36,160 (1,653 ) (5 %) ALS 824 9,378 (8,554 ) (91 %) CAD 21,037 7,115 13,922 196 % HSCT-TMA 2,612 2,842 (230 ) (8 %) GA 59,134 52,078 7,056 14 % Other development and discovery programs 51,463 52,733 (1,270 ) (2 %) Total program-specific costs 187,456 179,810 7,646 4 % Unallocated external costs Non-program specific external costs 6,966 7,002 (36 ) (1 %) Total unallocated external costs 6,966 7,002 (36 ) (1 %) Unallocated internal costs Compensation and related personnel costs 128,029 162,515 (34,486 ) (21 %) Other expenses 5,119 5,060 59 1 % Total unallocated internal costs 133,148 167,575 (34,427 ) (21 %) Total research and development costs $ 327,570 $ 354,387 $ (26,817 ) (8 %) Research and development expenses decreased by $26.8 million to $327.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $354.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 8%. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to a $34.5 million decrease in compensation and related personnel costs, which was partially offset by a $7.6 million increase in program specific external costs. The increase in our program-specific external costs of $7.6 million was driven by an increase of $13.9 million as a result of a $15.0 million one-time expense related to the discontinuation of the CAD program and an increase of $7.1 million in GA costs related to development and pre-clinical programs. These increases were partially offset by a $1.7 million decrease related to C3G and IC-MPGN costs, a $1.6 million decrease in PNH, a $8.6 million decrease in ALS costs due to the discontinuation of the Phase 2 MERIDIAN study, and a $1.3 million decrease in other development and discovery program costs. The decrease in compensation and related personnel costs of $34.5 million was driven by a $32.8 million decrease in salaries and benefits due to lower headcount compared to the prior year and a $1.7 million decrease in share-based compensation expense. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $0.3 million to $501.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $500.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $2.1 million in office expenses, an increase of $1.7 million in factoring fees, an increase of $1.2 million in travel expenses, and an increase of $1.5 million in insurance expenses, which were partially offset by a decrease of $4.6 million in professional and consulting fees and a decrease in personnel related costs of $1.7 million. The decrease in personnel related costs of $1.7 million consisted of a $0.7 million decrease in recruiting expenses and a $10.6 million decrease in salaries and benefits, partially offset by a $9.7 million increase in share-based compensation expense. Loss on extinguishment of development liability 102 Table of Contents We paid our remaining obligations under the SFJ agreement in full in May 2024. We concluded that the development liability was extinguished as of the payoff date. The difference of $1.9 million between the reacquisition price of $326.5 million and the net carrying value of the development liability of $324.6 million was recorded as a loss on the extinguishment of the development liability as of December 31, 2024. Interest Income Interest income was $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $8.1 million, compared to $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to decreased investments and a decline in money market rates during the year ended December 31, 2024. Interest Expense Interest expense was $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $10.8 million, compared to $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily due to the interest incurred under the Credit Facility and was partially offset by a decrease in the balance of the development liability. Other (Expense)/ Income, Net Other expense was $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to other expense of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to foreign currency revaluation losses. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to state taxes. Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 A discussion of changes in our results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 has been omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K but may be found in Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024 (the 2023 Form 10-K ), which discussion is incorporated herein by reference, and which is available free of charge on the SECs website at www.sec.gov. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity To date, we have financed our operations primarily through approximately $2.6 billion in net proceeds from public and private offerings of our common stock and convertible securities, $401.5 million in payments and royalties from Sobi pursuant to our collaboration agreement, $532.5 million under various credit arrangements, including with Sixth Street and SFJ, and $98.8 million relating to the unwinding of the capped call transactions in March 2024, as well as from the proceeds of our operations. In May 2024, we entered into the Sixth Street Financing Agreement, which provides for the Credit Facility, consisting of an initial draw of $375.0 million at closing and a potential additional $100.0 million draw at our option upon satisfaction of a $50.0 million minimum cash requirement and a requirement that our trailing three-month sales of SYFOVRE is at least $180.0 million prior to the $100.0 million draw. The Credit Facility matures on May 13, 2030 and bears interest at an annual rate equal to the 3-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) + 5.75% (subject to 1.00% floor). Certain additional commitment and undrawn amount fees are also payable in connection with the Credit Facility. We used the majority of the proceeds of the $375.0 million draw at closing to buy out our remaining obligations owed to SFJ, in the amount of approximately $326.5 million. We are permitted under the Sixth Street Financing Agreement to enter into a separate asset-based financing arrangement with a third party in an amount of up to $100.0 million, which amount is increased to $200.0 million upon certain sales or market 103 Table of Contents capitalization thresholds, and to have outstanding convertible unsecured notes in an amount equal to the greater of $400.0 million and 10% of our market capitalization, but not to exceed $600.0 million. In August 2024, the Company entered into an agreement (the "Factoring Agreement") to sell certain accounts receivable to a third-party financial institution at a discount to the face value of the accounts receivable. Under the Factoring Agreement, the maximum amount of outstanding accounts receivables sold at any time is $100.0 million. In November 2023, we entered into a sales agreement, or the sales agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, as agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering from of up to $300.0 million from time to time. Any sales made under the sales agreement will be made at market prices by any method that is deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. Any sales under the sales agreement will be made pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3, which became effective on February 22, 2023. We agreed to pay Cowen compensation of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of the sale of shares made under the sales agreement. We did not make any sales under the sales agreement during the year ended December 31, 2024. In February 2023, we issued and sold 4,007,936 shares of our common stock and, in lieu of common stock to investors who so chose, pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,380,956 shares of our common stock in a follow-on offering, including 833,333 shares sold pursuant to the underwriters exercise in full of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. The price to the public of the shares of common stock was $63.00 per share and the price to the public of the pre-funded warrants was $62.9999 per pre-funded warrant. The pre-funded warrants have an exercise price equal to $0.0001 per share and do not expire. The pre-funded warrants were accounted for as equity instruments. We received total net proceeds of $384.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $18.8 million and offering cost of $0.3 million. For the period ended December 31, 2024 2,299,991 shares of common stocks were issued from the exercise of pre-funded warrants. As of December 31, 2024, pre-funded warrants to purchase 80,956 shares of our common stock were still outstanding. In February 2024, we entered into agreements with the capped call counterparties to unwind a portion of the capped call transactions. The unwind agreements applied to the portion of the capped call transactions in a notional amount corresponding to the $426.1 million principal amount of Convertible Notes that we held in treasury as of December 31, 2024 or have been previously converted. The unwind transactions were settled at volume-weighted average price per share of $64.11, which resulted in cash proceeds to us of $98.8 million. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining capped call transactions had a notional amount corresponding to $93.9 million principal amount of Convertible Notes. Cash Flows The following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities $ (87,866 ) $ (594,735 ) Net cash used in investing activities (403 ) (674 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 149,241 394,499 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (659 ) 135 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 60,313 $ (200,775 ) Net Cash Used in Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was $87.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $197.9 million adjusted for $128.4 million of non-cash items, including share-based compensation expense of $114.1 million, depreciation expense of $1.8 million, loss on extinguishment of development liability of $1.9 million and accretion of discount to the development liability of $8.9 million. Further, it included a net increase in operating assets and liabilities of $18.4 million, which was driven by an increases in accounts receivable of $58.5 million, an increase in inventory of $10.8 million, a decrease in prepaid assets of $20.4 million, a decrease in other current assets of $10.8 million, an increase in accounts payable of $1.1 million, and an increase in accrued expenses of $18.2 million. The change in accounts receivable was primarily driven by the derecognition of certain accounts receivable under our Factoring Agreement. Net cash used in operating activities was $594.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $528.6 million adjusted for $134.1 million of non-cash items, including share-based compensation expense of $105.9 million, depreciation expense of $1.8 million, accretion of discount to the development liability of $26.0 million and accretion of discounts for 104 Table of Contents convertible debt of $0.3 million.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $0.4 million due primarily to purchases of fixed assets. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $0.7 million due primarily to purchases of fixed assets and partially offset by proceeds from the sale of fixed assets. Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $149.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 and consisted primarily of net proceeds from the initial draw of the Credit Facility of $358.2 million, the settlement of capped call unwind transactions of $98.8 million, $14.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and $4.5 million of proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by repayment of $326.5 million for the development liability.

Funding Requirements We expect to continue incur expenses to support our ongoing commercial activities related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of EMPAVELI for PNH and SYFOVRE for GA. In addition, we expect to continue to incur expenses as we prioritize the ongoing development of systemic pegcetacoplan and focus our research initiatives on high potential opportunities. Together with the cash that we anticipate will be generated from sales of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE, we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our projected operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months, as well as our anticipated longer-term cash requirements and obligations. Our expectations regarding our short-term and long-term funding requirements are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may need additional capital resources to fund our operating plans and capital expenditure requirements. We are devoting substantial resources to the commercial infrastructure for SYFOVRE for GA. We are also devoting substantial resources to the development of our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the commercialization of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE and development of other product candidates, and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for any of these activities is unknown, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with the research, development and commercialization. Our future funding requirements and long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors, including : our ability to continue to successfully commercialize and sell EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE in the United States; the cost of and our ability to obtain regulatory approvals of SYFOVRE outside of the United States and continue to build a commercial infrastructure for SYFOVRE for GA in the United States and worldwide; the cost of and our ability to effectively establish and maintain, the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities required to support the continued commercialization of EMPAVELI, SYFOVRE and any other products for which we receive marketing approval including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution; the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of, and research and preclinical development efforts for systemic pegcetacoplan, SYFOVRE and our other product candidates; our ability to maintain a productive collaborative relationship with Sobi with respect to systemic pegcetacoplan, including our ability to achieve milestone payments under our agreement with Sobi; our ability to identify additional collaborators for any of our product candidates and the terms and timing of any collaboration agreement that we may establish for the development and any commercialization of such product candidates; 105 Table of Contents the number and characteristics of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements; the outcome, timing and costs of clinical trials and of seeking regulatory approvals of pegcetacoplan in other jurisdictions and indications and other product candidates we may pursue; the costs of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval to the extent such costs are not the responsibility of any collaborators, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities; subject to receipt of marketing approval, revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of pegcetacoplan in other jurisdictions and indications and our other product candidates; our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our research and development and establish a commercial infrastructure; the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims; the effect of competing technological and market developments; the effect of public health crises, including pandemics and epidemics, on the healthcare system and the economy generally and on our clinical trials and other operations specifically; our ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE in the United States or any other product we commercialize; and the costs of operating as a public company. If our cash and cash equivalents, and cash generated from sales of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE are not sufficient to fund our planned expenditures, we will need to finance our cash needs through external sources of funds, which may include equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements. We currently do not have any committed external source of funds. If we are unable to generate sufficient funds from sales of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE, or raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of payment due date by period at December 31, 2024: Payments Due by Period (In thousands) Less than More than Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years Credit Facility (1) $ 595,778 $ 42,102 $ 84,205 $ 84,320 $ 385,151 Convertible notes (2) 99,511 3,286 96,225 Non-cancellable purchase commitments (3) 56,489 54,089 1,400 1,000 Operating leases (4) 18,307 7,468 9,427 1,412 Total $ 770,085 $ 106,945 $ 191,257 $ 86,732 $ 385,151 (1) Amounts include interest on the credit facility outstanding as of December 31, 2024, applying contractual interest rate and assuming scheduled payments are paid as contractually required through maturity. (2) Amounts include interest on long-term debt obligations under the debt outstanding as of December 31, 2024, applying contractual fixed interest rate and assuming scheduled payments are paid as contractually required through maturity. (3) Amounts include our obligations under supply agreements with Bachem and NOF as of December 31, 2024 and obligations under supply agreements with other vendors. (4) Represents future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases. The minimum lease payments above do not include any related common area maintenance charges or real estate taxes. We have entered into contracts to conduct research and development activities with third parties which commit us to pay future milestone payments or to pay royalty fees if any of the research results in regulatory approval or commercial revenue for a product. The scope of the services under the research and development contracts can be modified and the contracts cancelled by us upon 106 Table of Contents written notice. In some instances, the contracts may be cancelled by the third party upon written notice. If we were to cancel these contracts, we would be required only to pay for activities incurred through termination date. We are a party to a license agreement with Penn for an exclusive, worldwide license to specified patent rights in the ophthalmic field of use. We are required to make milestone payments aggregating up to $3.2 million based upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones and up to $5.0 million based upon the achievement of specified annual sales milestones with respect to each licensed product, and to pay low single-digit royalties based on net sales of each licensed product and with minimum quarterly royalty thresholds. In addition, we are obligated to pay a specified portion of income we receive from sublicensees. In April 2023, we paid $2.3 million for the achievement of a regulatory milestone as a result of the FDA approval of SYFOVRE in February 2023. In 2023, we incurred $5.0 million as a result of the achievement of sales milestones for SYFOVRE of which we paid $2.0 million in October 2023 and the remaining $3.0 million in January 2024. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, we have incurred royalty expense of $19.8 million and $8.9 million on sales of SYFOVRE, which is included in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. In addition, we are a party to a license agreement with Penn for an exclusive, worldwide license to specified patent rights for the development and commercialization of products in nonophthalmic fields of use, as defined therein. We are required to make milestone payments aggregating up to $1.7 million, based upon the achievement of development and regulatory approval milestones, and up to $2.5 million, based upon the achievement of annual sales milestones with respect to each of the first two licensed products. The license agreement also requires us to pay low single digit royalties based on net sales of each licensed product, subject to minimum quarterly royalty thresholds. In addition, we are obligated to pay a specified portion of income we receive from sublicensees. In January 2021, we paid $25.0 million for a sublicense fee owed to Penn related to the Sobi collaboration agreement and another licensing transaction. In August 2021, we paid $1.0 million to Penn upon the achievement of a development milestone, net of a credit for the annual license maintenance payment. In June 2022, we paid an additional $5.0 million to Penn as a sublicense fee upon the achievement of a development milestone under the Sobi collaboration. In January 2023, we paid $1.0 million to Penn upon the achievement of a sales milestone for EMPAVELI in 2022. In January 2024, we paid $0.5 million for a sublicense fee owed to Penn related to Sobi obtaining regulatory approval in Japan. Additionally, in January 2024, we paid $1.5 million as a result of the achievement of a sales milestone for EMPAVELI and Aspaveli. As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we have incurred royalty expense of $6.4 million, $4.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively, on sales of EMPAVELI and Aspaveli, which is included in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with CROs for clinical trials and clinical supply manufacturing and with vendors for preclinical research studies and other services and products for operating purposes. We have not included these payments in the table of contractual obligations above since either the contracts are cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30 days prior written notice to the CRO, or the noncancelable minimum purchase commitments under such contracts have already been satisfied. We have certain non-cancelable purchase obligations related to the manufacturing of drug substance and drug product. We have agreed to purchase from Bachem Americas, Inc. a significant portion of its requirements for the pegcetacoplan drug substance. Under a commercial supply agreement with NOF Corporation ("NOF"), we have agreed to purchase activated polyethylene glycol derivative, or PEG, which is a component of pegcetacoplan. In September 2024, we terminated the minimum purchase obligation with NOF for 2025. Under these agreements, as of December 31, 2024 we are obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $45.7 million to these vendors. As a result of this termination, the Company incurred an expense of $6.4 million, which is included in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As the amount is not due until January 2026, it is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. In addition, the Company has other non-cancelable purchase agreements as of December 31, 2024, under which it is obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $10.7 million to vendors.
