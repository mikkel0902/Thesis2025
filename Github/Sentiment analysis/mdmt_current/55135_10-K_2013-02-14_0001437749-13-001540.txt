ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS . Executive Overview The Staffing Industry The worldwide staffing industry is competitive and highly fragmented. In the United States, approximately 100 competitors operate nationally, and approximately 10,000 smaller companies compete in varying degrees at local levels. Additionally, several similar staffing companies compete globally. Demand for temporary services is highly dependent on the overall strength of the global economy and labor markets. In periods of economic growth, demand for temporary services generally increases, and the need to recruit, screen, train, retain and manage a pool of employees who match the skills required by particular customers becomes critical. Conversely, during an economic downturn, competitive pricing pressures can pose a threat to retaining a qualified temporary workforce. Accordingly, the on-going economic crisis in the Eurozone and slow recovery from recession in the U.S. has impacted all staffing firms over the last several years. Our Business Kelly Services is a global staffing company, providing innovative workforce solutions for customers in a variety of industries. Our staffing operations are divided into three regions, Americas, EMEA and APAC, with commercial and professional and technical staffing businesses in each region. As the human capital arena has become more complex, we have also developed a suite of innovative solutions within our global OCG Group. We are forging strategic relationships with our customers to help them manage their flexible workforces, through outsourcing, consulting, recruitment, career transition and vendor management services. We earn revenues from the hourly sales of services by our temporary employees to customers, as a result of recruiting permanent employees for our customers, and through our outsourcing and consulting activities. Our working capital requirements are primarily generated from temporary employee payroll and customer accounts receivable. The nature of our business is such that trade accounts receivable are our most significant financial asset. Average days sales outstanding varies within and outside the U.S., but averages more than 50 days on a global basis. Since receipts from customers generally lag temporary employee payroll, working capital requirements increase substantially in periods of growth. Our Strategy and Outlook Our long-term strategic objective is to create shareholder value by delivering a competitive profit from the best workforce solutions and talent in the industry. We have set a long-term goal to achieve a competitive return on sales of 4%. To attain this, we are focused on the following key areas: Maintain our core strengths in commercial staffing and key markets; Aggressively grow our professional and technical staffing; Transform our OCG segment into a market-leading provider of talent supply chain management; Capture permanent placement growth in selected specialties; and Lower our costs through deployment of efficient service delivery models. In the face of economic uncertainty, softening demand, and declining revenue, we made progress in 2012, although at a pace slower than we had originally expected. During 2012, we: Maintained our competitive position in key global staffing markets; Grew our professional and technical business by 3% year over year, despite a 2% decline in total revenue; Increased our OCG revenue by 25% year over year and improved earnings from operations by over $11 million; Increased permanent placement fees by 7% year over year; and Reduced expenses by 1% in comparison to last year. We improved our return on sales by 30 basis points to 1.3%, although still far short of our long-term goal of 4.0%. In order to make significant progress against our long-term goal, we will need much stronger economic growth in order to leverage our business. 17 Looking ahead, although the U.S. unemployment rate is currently below 8%, overall job growth remains tepid, and U.S. temporary job growth is decelerating -- trends that are likely to continue in 2013. We expect that ongoing economic uncertainty in the U.S., fueled by the fiscal situation, will continue to constrain hiring in the near-term. In Europe, we do not anticipate any significant changes to the recessionary conditions that continue to take their toll on the labor market. An additional challenge for us will be to meet the 2014 provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Acts ). The Acts represent comprehensive health care reform legislation that, in addition to other provisions, will require that we offer affordable, minimum essential health care coverage to certain temporary employees (and dependents) in the United States or incur penalties. In order to comply with the Acts, Kelly intends to begin offering health care coverage in 2014 to all temporary employees eligible for coverage under the Acts. At this point in time, we are unable to estimate the costs of complying with the Acts. Estimating the costs of complying with the Acts is difficult due to a variety of factors associated with our temporary employee population, including: the number of employees who are eligible for coverage; the percentage of eligible employees who will enroll for health care coverage; the number of months during the following year that those employees who accept coverage remain an employee; determination of the appropriate employee contribution share for affordability purposes; the cost and availability of health care coverage that meets the Acts requirements; and the cost of implementation and ongoing administrative costs of compliance. Although we intend to pass ongoing costs on to our customers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase pricing to our customers in a sufficient amount to cover the increased costs, and the net financial impact on our results of operations could be significant. Longer-term, we believe the trends in the staffing industry are positive: companies are becoming more comfortable with the use of flexible staffing models; there is increasing acceptance of free agents and contractual employment by companies and candidates alike; and companies are searching for more comprehensive workforce management solutions. This shift in demand for contingent labor plays to our strengths and experience -- particularly serving large companies. Financial Measures Operating Margin and Constant Currency Operating margin (earnings from operations divided by revenue from services) in the following tables is a ratio used to measure the Company pricing strategy and operating efficiency. Constant currency ( CC ) change amounts are non-GAAP measures. CC change amounts in the following tables refer to the year-over-year percentage changes resulting from translating 2012 financial data into U.S. dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates used to translate financial data for 2011. We believe that CC measurements are an important analytical tool to aid in understanding underlying operating trends without distortion due to currency fluctuations. 18 Results of Operations 2012 versus 2011 Total Company (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Change CC Change Revenue from services $ 5,450.5 $ 5,551.0 (1.8 ) % (0.2 ) % Fee-based income 148.2 138.0 7.3 10.1 Gross profit 896.6 883.3 1.5 3.3 SG&A expenses excluding restructuring charges 822.1 822.8 (0.1 ) Restructuring charges (0.9 ) 2.8 (132.3 ) Total SG&A expenses 821.2 825.6 (0.6 ) 1.2 Asset impairments 3.1 - NM Earnings from operations 72.3 57.7 25.3 Gross profit rate 16.5 % 15.9 % 0.6 pts. Expense rates (excluding restructuring charges): % of revenue 15.1 14.8 0.3 % of gross profit 91.7 93.2 (1.5 ) Operating margin 1.3 1.0 0.3 Total Company revenue for 2012 was down 2% in comparison to the prior year, and declined 3% excluding the Company 2011 acquisition of Tradi o described below. On a CC basis, total Company revenue was flat and down 1% excluding the Company acquisition of Tradi o. This reflected an 11% decrease in hours worked, partially offset by a 9% increase in average bill rates on a CC basis. Hours decreased in our staffing business in all three regions. The decrease in the Americas and EMEA was due, in large part, to the economic uncertainty existing in both regions, while the decline in APAC was due to decisions we made to exit low-margin business in India. The improvement in average bill rates was primarily due to the mix of countries, particularly the business we exited in India with very low average bill rates. Compared to 2011, the gross profit rate improved by 60 basis points due to higher fee-based income and an improved temporary gross profit rate in the Americas and APAC regions and the OCG segment. The improvement in the Americas temporary gross profit rate included the impact of lower workers compensation costs. We regularly update our estimates of open workers compensation claims. Due to favorable development of claims and payment data, we reduced our estimated costs of prior year workers compensation by $10 million for 2012. This compares to an adjustment reducing prior year workers compensation claims by $6 million for 2011. Fee-based income, which is included in revenue from services, has a significant impact on gross profit rates. There are very low direct costs of services associated with fee-based income. Therefore, increases or decreases in fee-based income can have a disproportionate impact on gross profit rates. Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses excluding restructuring decreased slightly year over year. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we embarked on a restructuring program for certain of our EMEA operations in Italy, France and Ireland. The total net restructuring benefit in 2012 included $3 million of revisions of the estimated lease termination costs for previously closed EMEA Commercial branches, partially offset by $2 million of severance and lease termination costs for those EMEA Commercial branches which are in the process of closing. We expect to spend approximately $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2013 to complete the restructuring in EMEA. Restructuring costs in 2011 relate primarily to revisions of the estimated lease termination costs for previously closed EMEA Commercial branches. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we made the decision to abandon our PeopleSoft billing system implementation in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico and, accordingly, recorded asset impairment charges of $3 million, representing previously capitalized costs associated with this project. 19 Income tax expense for 2012 was $19 million (27.8%), compared to a benefit of $7 million (-12.6%) for 2011. The 2012 income tax expense was impacted by the expiration of employment-related income tax credits, including the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment ( HIRE ) Act retention credit, which was unavailable in 2012, and the work opportunity credit, which was available in 2012 only for veterans and pre-2012 hires. Together, these income tax credits totaled $8 million in 2012, compared to $28 million in 2011. The work opportunity credit was retroactively reinstated on January 2, 2013, which will result in a first quarter 2013 tax benefit of $9 million that would have been recognized in 2012 if the law had been in effect at year-end 2012. In 2012, the Company closed income tax examinations relating to prior years, resulting in a $5 million benefit. During 2011, the Company determined that for tax reporting purposes, it was eligible for worthless stock deductions related to foreign subsidiaries, which provided U.S. federal and state benefits of $8 million in 2011. Diluted earnings from continuing operations per share for 2012 were $1.31, as compared to $1.72 for 2011. Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations for 2012 and 2011 represent adjustments to the estimated costs of litigation, net of tax, retained from the 2007 sale of the Kelly Home Care business unit. Total Americas (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Change CC Change Revenue from services $ 3,672.1 $ 3,643.7 0.8 % 1.3 % Fee-based income 30.2 25.3 19.0 20.3 Gross profit 547.9 523.1 4.7 5.2 Total SG&A expenses 405.8 396.4 2.4 3.0 Earnings from operations 142.1 126.7 12.0 Gross profit rate 14.9 % 14.4 % 0.5 pts. Expense rates: % of revenue 11.1 10.9 0.2 % of gross profit 74.1 75.8 (1.7 ) Operating margin 3.9 3.5 0.4 On an organic basis, excluding the Tradi o acquisition in Brazil in late 2011, CC revenue decreased slightly. This was attributable to a 4% decrease in hours worked, partially offset by a 3% increase in average bill rates on a CC basis. During 2012, the PT segment revenue grew by 5%, while the Commercial segment revenue, excluding Tradi o, declined 3%. The PT segment growth was fueled primarily by increases in hours and revenues in our engineering, IT and finance services. The decrease in Commercial segment revenue was driven primarily by decreases in light industrial and electronic assembly service lines, reflecting slowing demand as the year progressed, due to economic uncertainties. Americas represented 67% of total Company revenue in 2012 and 66% in 2011. The increase in our gross profit rate was due to the combined effects of increased fee-based income, pricing increases and the decreases in workers compensation costs noted above. The year-over-year increase in total SG&A expenses is due to the costs associated with our Tradi o operation. Total SG&A expenses without Tradi o decreased slightly from last year. 20 Total EMEA (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Change CC Change Revenue from services $ 1,022.9 $ 1,169.0 (12.5 ) % (6.7 ) % Fee-based income 39.2 44.1 (11.2 ) (5.5 ) Gross profit 176.8 207.7 (14.9 ) (9.2 ) SG&A expenses excluding restructuring charges 169.0 186.9 (9.7 ) Restructuring charges (0.9 ) 2.8 (132.3 ) Total SG&A expenses 168.1 189.7 (11.5 ) (6.0 ) Earnings from operations 8.7 18.0 (51.6 ) Gross profit rate 17.3 % 17.8 % (0.5 ) pts. Expense rates (excluding restructuring charges): % of revenue 16.5 16.0 0.5 % of gross profit 95.6 90.1 5.5 Operating margin 0.8 1.5 (0.7 ) The change in EMEA revenue from services reflected an 11% decrease in hours worked. The decrease primarily reflects the difficult economic environment in the European Union. However, we also saw a decrease in our hours in Russia, where we were focused on gaining higher-margin customers. The decrease in volume was partially offset by a 5% increase in average bill rates on a CC basis. This was the result of average bill rate increases in Switzerland due to favorable customer mix and Russia where, as noted above, we were focused on higher-margin customers. EMEA represented 19% of total Company revenue in 2012 and 21% in 2011 . The EMEA gross profit rate decreased due to both a mix change, where higher-margin retail business decreased by more than lower-margin corporate accounts, and a decrease in fee-based income in the Eurozone due to the economic environment. The decrease in SG&A expenses excluding restructuring charges was primarily due to a reduction of full-time employees in specific countries. Restructuring costs recorded in 2012 reflect the net costs associated with the restructuring actions taken in Italy, France and Ireland in the fourth quarter of 2012, offset by adjustments to prior restructuring costs in the U.K. Total APAC (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Change CC Change Revenue from services $ 394.8 $ 449.0 (12.1 ) % (11.5 ) % Fee-based income 27.5 29.2 (5.8 ) (4.8 ) Gross profit 71.1 76.3 (6.8 ) (6.3 ) Total SG&A expenses 73.4 77.0 (4.7 ) (4.1 ) Earnings from operations (2.3 ) (0.7 ) (207.4 ) Gross profit rate 18.0 % 17.0 % 1.0 pts. Expense rates: % of revenue 18.6 17.2 1.4 % of gross profit 103.3 101.0 2.3 Operating margin (0.6 ) (0.2 ) (0.4 ) 21 The change in total APAC revenue reflected a 35% decrease in hours worked, partially offset by a 35% increase in average bill rates on a CC basis. The change in both hours worked and average bill rates were due primarily to a decision to exit low-margin customers in India. In addition to reducing hours, this changed our mix of business, as the average bill rate in India is significantly lower than that of the APAC region. We also saw a decrease in hours worked in Australia, where market demand for temporary volume in the lower margin manufacturing and light industrial service lines has slowed down. APAC revenue represented 7% of total Company revenue in 2012 and 8% in 2011. The improvement in the APAC gross profit rate was also due to the decision to exit a number of lower-margin customers in India. The temporary gross profit rate in India was significantly lower than the temporary gross profit rate of the region. Fee-based income also contributed to the improvement in the gross profit rate. Although fees declined on a year-over-year basis, they declined by less than total revenue and thus had a positive mix effect. The change in SG&A expenses reflects a decrease in full-time salaries due, in part, to a decision to keep open positions vacant in response to volume pressures in the region. OCG (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Change CC Change Revenue from services $ 396.1 $ 317.3 24.8 % 25.5 % Fee-based income 51.4 39.5 30.0 32.1 Gross profit 104.0 78.8 32.0 33.5 Total SG&A expenses 95.4 81.4 17.0 18.6 Earnings from operations 8.6 (2.6 ) NM Gross profit rate 26.3 % 24.8 % 1.5 pts. Expense rates: % of revenue 24.1 25.7 (1.6 ) % of gross profit 91.6 103.4 (11.8 ) Operating margin 2.2 (0.8 ) 3.0 Revenue from services in the OCG segment increased during 2012 due to growth in BPO of 40%, RPO growth of 22% and CWO growth of 20%. The revenue growth in BPO was due to expansion of programs with existing customers, RPO revenue increased, in part, due to a large project which was completed in the third quarter and CWO growth was due to implementation of new customers. OCG revenue represented 7% of total Company revenue in 2012 and 6% in 2011. The OCG gross profit rate increased primarily due to mix as volume increased in the higher margin BPO, RPO and CWO practice areas. The increase in SG&A expenses is primarily the result of support costs, salaries and incentive-based compensation associated with new customer programs, as well as higher volumes on existing programs in our BPO, RPO and CWO practice areas. 22 Results of Operations 2011 versus 2010 Total Company (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 Change CC Change Revenue from services $ 5,551.0 $ 4,950.3 12.1 % 9.6 % Fee-based income 138.0 99.0 39.4 33.4 Gross profit 883.3 786.9 12.3 9.4 SG&A expenses excluding restructuring charges 822.8 739.6 11.3 Restructuring charges 2.8 7.2 (61.7 ) Total SG&A expenses 825.6 746.8 10.6 7.6 Asset impairments - 2.0 (100.0 ) Earnings from operations 57.7 38.1 51.4 Gross profit rate 15.9 % 15.9 % - pts. Expense rates (excluding restructuring charges): % of revenue 14.8 14.9 (0.1 ) % of gross profit 93.2 94.0 (0.8 ) Operating margin 1.0 0.8 0.2 The U.S. and global economies slowly strengthened during 2011. More than 1.8 million jobs were created in the U.S., representing the best performance in five years. Within the U.S. staffing industry, more than 650,000 jobs were added since the recovery began in September 2009, and the temporary help penetration rate grew steadily during 2011, concluding the year at 1.81%. As a result of these improving conditions, we were able to increase the number of hours worked by 7%, in comparison to 2010. This, combined with a 2% increase in average bill rates on a CC basis, drove our year-over-year revenue increase. On a CC basis, revenue increased in all business segments. Compared to 2010, the 2011 gross profit rate was unchanged. The growth in fee-based income offset a decline in the temporary staffing gross profit rate which resulted from the expiration of the HIRE Act payroll tax benefit in the U.S. The HIRE Act, which allowed employers to receive tax incentives for hiring and retaining previously unemployed individuals, resulted in a benefit to our gross profit of $21 million in 2010. HIRE Act benefits were also available in 2011, but as an income tax credit, rather than a benefit to the Company gross profit. SG&A expenses increased year over year due primarily to higher compensation costs. During 2011 we hired full-time employees, primarily in our PT and OCG businesses as part of executing our business strategy, reinstated certain retirement benefits and merit increase programs and increased incentive-based compensation. Restructuring costs incurred in 2011 primarily related to revisions of the estimated lease termination costs for EMEA Commercial branches that closed in prior years. Restructuring costs incurred in 2010 primarily related to severance and lease termination costs for branches in the EMEA Commercial and APAC Commercial segments that were in the process of closure at the end of 2009, and severance costs related to the corporate headquarters. Income tax benefit for 2011 was $7 million (-12.6%), compared to income tax expense of $7 million (20.2%) for 2010. The income tax benefit in 2011 was largely impacted by significant employment-related income tax credits, including the favorable impact of the HIRE Act retention credit of $11 million and continued strong work opportunity credits of $17 million. Together, these income tax credits totaled $28 million in 2011, compared to $12 million in 2010 . The Company also determined that for tax reporting purposes it was eligible for worthless stock deductions related to foreign subsidiaries, which provided U.S. federal and state benefits of $8 million in 2011, compared to $1 million in 2010. The HIRE Act retention credit was available only in 2011, and was in addition to the HIRE Act payroll tax benefits recognized in cost of services in 2010. 23 Included in earnings from continuing operations were restructuring charges of $3 million, net of tax, for 2011 and $5 million, net of tax, for 2010. Diluted earnings from continuing operations per share for 2011 were $1.72, as compared to $0.71 for 2010. Discontinued operations in 2011 represents costs of litigation, net of tax, retained from the 2007 sale of the Kelly Home Care business unit. Total Americas (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 Change CC Change Revenue from services $ 3,643.7 $ 3,317.2 9.8 % 9.5 % Fee-based income 25.3 17.8 43.3 42.6 Gross profit 523.1 493.5 6.1 5.8 SG&A expenses excluding restructuring charges 396.4 367.6 7.9 Restructuring charges - 0.3 (100.0 ) Total SG&A expenses 396.4 367.9 7.8 7.5 Earnings from operations 126.7 125.6 1.0 Gross profit rate 14.4 % 14.9 % (0.5 ) pts. Expense rates (excluding restructuring charges): % of revenue 10.9 11.1 (0.2 ) % of gross profit 75.8 74.5 1.3 Operating margin 3.5 3.8 (0.3 ) The change in Americas revenue from services reflected a 7% increase in hours worked, combined with a 2% increase in average bill rates on a CC basis. Commercial revenues increased by nearly 10%, primarily due to increases in demand from existing and new light industrial customers and an increase in our electronic assembly service lines during the year. Our PT segment grew just over 10%, fueled by solid growth in our science, engineering and IT services. Americas represented 66% of total Company revenue in 2011 and 67% in 2010. The change in the gross profit rate was due primarily to the unfavorable impact related to the expiration of the HIRE Act payroll tax benefit. SG&A expenses increased due to the reinstatement of merit increases and certain retirement benefits, higher incentive-based compensation and additional PT staff. 24 Total EMEA (Dollars in millions) CC 2011 2010 Change Change Revenue from services $ 1,169.0 $ 1,019.6 14.7 % 6.7 % Fee-based income 44.1 34.1 28.6 20.7 Gross profit 207.7 179.5 15.6 7.6 SG&A expenses excluding restructuring charges 186.9 167.2 11.9 Restructuring charges 2.8 2.7 4.0 Total SG&A expenses 189.7 169.9 11.8 3.9 Asset impairments - 1.5 (100.0 ) Earnings from operations 18.0 8.1 115.7 Gross profit rate 17.8 % 17.6 % 0.2 pts.

Approximately half of the increase relates to the strategic focus on higher skilled candidates in the U.K., France, Germany and Norway. Salary inflation in Russia also accounts for a large portion of the increase. EMEA revenue represented 21% of total Company revenue in both 2011 and 2010. The change in the EMEA gross profit rate was primarily due to increases in fee-based income, as a result of targeted investments in additional full-time employees in new or existing branches in Russia, France, Italy and Germany. Russia accounted for approximately one-third of the growth in fees, and France, Italy and Germany each accounted for approximately 15% of the fee growth. The increase in SG&A expenses was due to increased hiring of full-time employees in specific countries. The vast majority of the investments were done in Switzerland, France, Germany and Russia, countries with identified high-growth potential and investments in additional PT branches in Russia, Germany and the U.K. 25 Total APAC (Dollars in millions) CC 2011 2010 Change Change Revenue from services $ 449.0 $ 387.8 15.8 % 7.9 % Fee-based income 29.2 21.9 34.8 25.6 Gross profit 76.3 62.2 22.6 13.6 SG&A expenses excluding restructuring charges 77.0 62.0 24.0 Restructuring charges - 0.5 (100.0 ) Total SG&A expenses 77.0 62.5 23.0 13.8 Earnings from operations (0.7 ) (0.3 ) (83.8 ) Gross profit rate 17.0 % 16.0 % 1.0 pts.

The volume increase was due to a 20% increase in hours worked by temporary employees in India for customers in the telecommunication services sector in the first half of the year. The decline in average hourly bill rates was due to the mix effect of adding hours in India, where the average bill rate is significantly lower than the average for the APAC region. APAC revenue represented 8% of total Company revenue in both 2011 and 2010. The improvement in the APAC gross profit rate was primarily due to higher growth in fee-based income. Nearly 50% of the fee growth came from Australia and New Zealand and approximately 25% came from China. This was the result of a focused effort on building the PT permanent placement practice in these countries. SG&A expenses increased, primarily due to higher salaries and related costs from the investment in additional full-time employees across the region. OCG (Dollars in millions) CC 2011 2010 Change Change Revenue from services $ 317.3 $ 254.8 24.5 % 23.6 % Fee-based income 39.5 25.6 54.3 49.8 Gross profit 78.8 54.1 45.6 43.2 SG&A expenses excluding restructuring charges 81.4 71.6 13.5 Restructuring charges - 0.1 (100.0 ) Total SG&A expenses 81.4 71.7 13.4 10.6 Earnings from operations (2.6 ) (17.6 ) 85.0 Gross profit rate 24.8 % 21.3 % 3.5 pts.

Growth in all practice areas was due to the expansion of programs with existing customers. OCG revenue represented 6% of total Company revenue in 2011 and 5% in 2010. The OCG gross profit rate increased primarily due to increased volume in the higher-margin BPO, RPO and CWO practice areas, as well as increases in gross profit rates for both the BPO and RPO practice areas in 2011. The increase in SG&A expenses is primarily the result of support costs, salaries and incentive-based compensation associated with the expansion of customer programs, as well as higher volumes on existing programs, in our RPO and CWO practice areas. Results of Operations Financial Condition Historically, we have financed our operations through cash generated by operating activities and access to credit markets. Our working capital requirements are primarily generated from temporary employee payroll and customer accounts receivable. Since receipts from customers generally lag payroll to temporary employees, working capital requirements increase substantially in periods of growth. Conversely, when economic activity slows, working capital requirements may substantially decrease. As highlighted in the consolidated statements of cash flows, our liquidity and available capital resources are impacted by four key components: cash and equivalents, operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents totaled $76 million at the end of 2012, compared to $81 million at year-end 2011. As further described below, during 2012, we generated $61 million of cash from operating activities, used $28 million of cash for investing activities and used $39 million in cash for financing activities. Operating Activities In 2012, we generated $61 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to generating $19 million in 2011 and $42 million in 2010. The increase from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to lower additional working capital requirements. The decrease from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to growth in working capital requirements, partially offset by improved operating results. Trade accounts receivable totaled $1.0 billion at the end of 2012. Global days sales outstanding ( DSO ) for the fourth quarter were 53 days for 2012, compared to 52 days for 2011. Our working capital position was $470 million at the end of 2012, an increase of $53 million from year-end 2011. The current ratio was 1.7 at year-end 2012 and 1.6 at year-end 2011. Investing Activities In 2012, we used $28 million of cash for investing activities, compared to $21 million in 2011 and $11 million in 2010. Capital expenditures, which totaled $22 million in 2012, $15 million in 2011 and $11 million in 2010, primarily related to the Company information technology programs, including costs for the implementation of the PeopleSoft payroll, billing and accounts receivable project. The PeopleSoft payroll, billing and accounts receivable project, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2004, was intended to cover the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico, the U.K. and Ireland. During 2012, management made the decision to abandon the billing system module in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, and wrote off the previously capitalized costs related to this portion of the project. To date, the Company has implemented modules associated with payroll in the northeast region of the U.S. and Canada, accounts receivable in all locations, payroll and billing in the U.K. and Ireland, and general ledger and fixed assets in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada. We anticipate spending approximately $3 to $4 million in 2013 to complete the PeopleSoft project. 27 During 2012, we entered into an agreement with Temp Holdings Co., Ltd. ( Temp Holdings ) to form a venture, TS Kelly Workforce Solutions ( TS Kelly ), in order to expand both companies presence in North Asia. As part of this agreement, we contributed our operations in China, South Korea and Hong Kong for a 49% ownership interest in TS Kelly. The $7 million investment represents a $2 million payment to TS Kelly, as well as the cash on hand at the operations we contributed. Our share of the operating results of TS Kelly will be recorded on an equity basis beginning in the first quarter of 2013. To establish the Company presence in the Brazilian market, we acquired the stock of Tradi o Planejamento e Tecnologia de Servi os S.A. and Tradi o Tecnologia e Servi os Ltda. (collectively, Tradi o ), a national service provider in Brazil, in November, 2011 for $7 million in cash. In addition to the cash payment, the Company assumed debt of $9 million as part of this transaction. The operating results of Tradi o are included as a business unit in the Americas Commercial operating segment. Financing Activities In 2012, we used $39 million in cash for financing activities, as compared to generating $6 million in 2011 and using $35 million in 2010. Changes in cash from financing activities are primarily related to borrowing activities. Debt totaled $64 million at year-end 2012 compared to $96 million at year-end 2011. Debt-to-total capital is a common ratio to measure the relative capital structure and leverage of the Company. Our ratio of debt-to-total capital (total debt reported on the balance sheet divided by total debt plus stockholders equity) was 8.0% at the end of 2012 and 12.5% at the end of 2011. In 2012, the net change in short-term borrowings included $21 million and $6 million related to payments on the securitization facility and revolving credit facility, respectively. In 2011, the net change in short-term borrowings included $67 million related to borrowings on t he securitization facility. Subsequent to the acquisition of Tradi o in November, 2011, we established an unsecured, uncommitted revolving line of credit for the Brazilian legal entities, and used the facility to pay off short-term debt. Accordingly, also included in the 2011 net change in short-term borrowings was $6 million related to borrowings under the revolving line of credit in Brazil. In 2010, the net change in short-term borrowings included $38 million related to payments on the securitization facility. During 2011, we repaid term debt of $68 million. Included in this amount was $5 million of short-term debt which was paid off by our Brazilian legal entities subsequent to the acquisition of Tradi o. During 2010, we paid $15 million due on our yen-denominated credit facility. Included in financing activities during 2010 was $24 million related to the sale of 1,576,169 shares of Kelly Class A common stock to Temp Holdings. The shares were sold in a private transaction at $15.42 per share, which was the average of the closing prices of the Class A common stock for the five days from May 3, 2010 through May 7, 2010, and represented 4.8 percent of the outstanding Class A shares after the completion of the sale. Dividends paid per common share were $0.20 in 2012 and $0.10 in 2011. No dividends were paid in 2010. Payments of dividends are restricted by the financial covenants contained in our debt facilities. Details of this restriction are contained in the Debt footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 28 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Summarized below are our obligations and commitments to make future payments as of year-end 2012: Payment due by period Total Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 years (In millions of dollars) Operating leases $ 108.0 $ 42.6 $ 45.1 $ 15.8 $ 4.5 Short-term borrowings 64.1 64.1 - - - Accrued insurance 76.3 32.8 19.8 9.2 14.5 Accrued retirement benefits 116.5 5.5 11.1 11.2 88.7 Other long-term liabilities 15.4 2.1 7.5 4.0 1.8 Uncertain income tax positions 3.1 0.1 0.8 1.0 1.2 Purchase obligations 31.6 16.7 14.9 - - Total $ 415.0 $ 163.9 $ 99.2 $ 41.2 $ 110.7 Purchase obligations above represent unconditional commitments relating primarily to voice and data communications services which we expect to utilize generally within the next two fiscal years, in the ordinary course of business. We have no material, unrecorded commitments, losses, contingencies or guarantees associated with any related parties or unconsolidated entities. Liquidity We expect to meet our ongoing short- and long-term cash requirements principally through cash generated from operations, available cash and equivalents, securitization of customer receivables and committed unused credit facilities. Additional funding sources could include public or private bonds, asset-based lending, additional bank facilities, issuance of equity or other sources. We utilize intercompany loans, dividends, capital contributions and redemptions to effectively manage our cash on a global basis. We periodically review our foreign subsidiaries cash balances and projected cash needs. As part of those reviews, we may identify cash that we feel should be repatriated to optimize the Company overall capital structure. At the present time, these reviews have not resulted in any specific plans to repatriate our international cash balances. We expect much of our international cash will be needed to fund working capital growth in our local operations. The majority of our international cash is concentrated in a cash pooling arrangement (the Cash Pool ) and is available to fund general corporate needs internationally. The Cash Pool is a set of cash accounts maintained with a single bank that must, as a whole, maintain at least a zero balance; individual accounts may be positive or negative. This allows countries with excess cash to invest and countries with cash needs to utilize the excess cash. We manage our cash and debt very closely to optimize our capital structure. As our cash balances build, we tend to pay down debt as appropriate. Conversely, when working capital needs grow, we tend to use corporate cash and cash available in the Cash Pool first, and then access our borrowing facilities. At year-end 2012, we had $150 million of available capacity on our $150 million revolving credit facility and $32 million of available capacity on our $150 million securitization facility. The securitization facility carried $63 million of short-term borrowings and $55 million of standby letters of credit related to workers compensation. Together, the revolving credit and securitization facilities provide the Company with committed funding capacity that may be used for general corporate purposes. While we believe these facilities will cover our working capital needs over the short term, if economic conditions or operating results change significantly, we may need to seek additional sources of funds. Throughout 2012 and as of the 2012 year end we met the debt covenants related to our revolving credit facility and securitization facility. 29 At year-end 2012, we also had additional unsecured, uncommitted short-term credit facilities totaling $13 million, under which we had borrowed $1 million. Details of our debt facilities as of the 2012 year end are contained in the Debt footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We monitor the credit ratings of our major banking partners on a regular basis. We also have regular discussions with them. Based on our reviews and communications, we believe the risk of one or more of our banks not being able to honor commitments is insignificant. We also review the ratings and holdings of our money market funds and other investment vehicles regularly to ensure high credit quality and access to our invested cash. As of the end of fiscal 2012, we had no holdings of sovereign debt in Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Spain or Greece. Our investment policy requires our international affiliates to contribute any excess cash balances to the Cash Pool. We then manage this as counterparty exposure and distribute the risk among our Cash Pool provider and other banks we may designate from time to time. At the end of fiscal 2012, our total exposure to European receivables from our customers was $284 million, which represents 28% of total trade accounts receivable, net. The percentage of trade accounts receivable over 90 days past due for Europe was consistent with our global experience. Net trade accounts receivable for Italy, Portugal and Ireland, specific countries currently experiencing economic volatility, totaled $38 million at the 2012 year end, and we have not experienced a significant deterioration in these amounts during 2012. Critical Accounting Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In this process, it is necessary for us to make certain assumptions and related estimates affecting the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the attached notes. Actual results can differ from assumed and estimated amounts. Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We consider the following estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Workers Compensation We have a combination of insurance and self-insurance contracts under which we effectively bear the first $500,000 of risk per single accident, except in the state of California, where we bear the first $750,000 of risk per single accident. There is no aggregate limitation on our per-risk exposure under these insurance and self-insurance programs. We establish accruals for workers compensation utilizing actuarial methods to estimate the undiscounted future cash payments that will be made to satisfy the claims, including an allowance for incurred-but-not-reported claims. This process includes establishing loss development factors, based on our historical claims experience as well as industry experience, and applying those factors to current claims information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claims liability. In preparing the estimates, we also consider the nature, frequency and severity of the claims, reserving practices of our third party claims administrators, performance of our medical cost management programs, changes in our territory and business line mix and current legal, economic and regulatory factors such as industry estimates of medical cost trends. Where appropriate, multiple generally-accepted actuarial techniques are applied and tested in the course of preparing our estimates. When claims exceed insured limits and realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable, we record a receivable from the insurance company for the excess amount. 30 We evaluate the accrual, and the underlying assumptions, regularly throughout the year and make adjustments as needed. The ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accrual. While we believe that the recorded amounts are reasonable, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger accrual is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to cost of services in the period in which we made such a determination. The accrual for workers compensation, net of related receivables which are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet, was $61 million and $70 million at year-end 2012 and 2011, respectively. Income Taxes Income tax expense is based on expected income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Judgment is required in determining our income tax expense. We establish accruals for uncertain tax positions under generally accepted accounting principles, which require that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities that have full knowledge of all relevant information. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of accruals and changes to accruals that we consider appropriate, as well as related interest and penalties. A number of years may lapse before a particular matter, for which we have or have not established an accrual, is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that our accruals are appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles. Favorable or unfavorable adjustment of the accrual for any particular issue would be recognized as an increase or decrease to our income tax expense in the period of a change in facts and circumstances. Our current tax accruals are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within income and other taxes and long-term tax accruals are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within other long-term liabilities. Tax laws require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the income tax expense reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than the liability reported in our tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, which are not deductible or taxable on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, which give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our consolidated income statement. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction on our tax return, but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements. Our net deferred tax asset is recorded using currently enacted tax rates, and may need to be adjusted in the event tax rates change. The U.S. work opportunity credit is allowed for wages earned by employees in certain targeted groups. The actual amount of creditable wages in a particular period is estimated, since the credit is only available once an employee reaches a minimum employment period and the employee inclusion in a targeted group is certified by the applicable state. As these events often occur after the period the wages are earned, judgment is required in determining the amount of work opportunity credits accrued for in each period. We evaluate the accrual regularly throughout the year and make adjustments as needed. Goodwill We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. Generally accepted accounting principles require that goodwill be tested for impairment at a reporting unit level. We have determined that our reporting units are the same as our operating and reportable segments. If we have determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value for one or more reporting units is greater than their carrying value, we may use a qualitative assessment for the annual impairment test. 31 In conducting the qualitative assessment, we assess the totality of relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value or carrying value of the reporting unit. Such events and circumstances may include macroeconomic conditions, industry and competitive environment conditions, overall financial performance, reporting unit specific events and market considerations. We may also consider recent valuations of the reporting unit, including the magnitude of the difference between the most recent fair value estimate and the carrying value, as well as both positive and adverse events and circumstances, and the extent to which each of the events and circumstances identified may affect the comparison of a reporting unit fair value with its carrying value. For reporting units where the qualitative assessment is not used, goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step process. In the first step, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required. To derive the estimated fair value of reporting units, we primarily relied on an income approach. Under the income approach, estimated fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit being measured. Estimated future cash flows are based on our internal projection model. Assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, a second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of a reporting unit goodwill. Determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires valuation of a reporting unit tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination. If the carrying value of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, goodwill is deemed impaired and is written down to the extent of the difference. We completed our annual impairment test for all reporting units in the fourth quarter for the fiscal year ended 2012 and 2011 and determined that goodwill was not impaired. In 2012, we performed a qualitative assessment for the Americas Commercial and Americas PT reporting units, and a step one quantitative assessment for the APAC PT and OCG reporting segments. In 2011, we performed a step one quantitative assessment for all reporting units. Our step one analysis used significant assumptions by segment, including: expected future revenue and expense growth rates, profit margins, cost of capital, discount rate and forecasted capital expenditures. Our revenue projections assumed near-term growth consistent with current year results, followed by long-term modest growth. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. Different assumptions of the anticipated future results and growth from these businesses could result in an impairment charge, which would decrease operating income and result in lower asset values on our consolidated balance sheet. For example, a 10% reduction in our growth rate assumptions would not result in the estimated fair value falling below book value for any of our segments. At year-end 2012 and 2011, total goodwill amounted to $90 million. (See the Goodwill footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements ). Litigation Kelly is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. Kelly routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the accruals required, if any, for these contingencies is made after analysis of each known issue. Development of the analysis includes consideration of many factors including: potential exposure, the status of proceedings, negotiations, results of similar litigation and participation rates. The required accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. For further discussion, see the Contingencies footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. At year-end 2012 and 2011, the accrual for litigation costs amounted to $3 million and $5 million, respectively, and is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. 32 Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and apply percentages to certain aged receivable categories. We also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, and we monitor historical trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. Historically, losses from uncollectible accounts have not exceeded our allowance. Since we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance may be required. In the event we determined that a smaller or larger allowance was appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to SG&A expense in the period in which we made such a determination. In addition, we also include a provision for sales allowances, based on our historical experience, in our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable. If sales allowances vary from our historical experience, an adjustment to the allowance may be required. As of year-end 2012 and 2011, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $10 million and $13 million, respectively.
