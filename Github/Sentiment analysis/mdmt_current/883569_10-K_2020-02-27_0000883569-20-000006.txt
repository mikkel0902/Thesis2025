Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary We are a global design, marketing and distribution company that specializes in consumer fashion accessories. Our principal offerings include an extensive line of men's and women's fashion watches and jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, belts, and sunglasses. In the watch and jewelry product categories, we have a diverse portfolio of globally recognized owned and licensed brand names under which our products are marketed. Our products are distributed globally through various distribution channels including wholesale in countries where we have a physical presence, direct to the consumer through our retail stores and commercial websites and through third-party distributors in countries where we do not maintain a physical presence. Our products are offered at varying price points to meet the needs of our customers, whether they are value-conscious or luxury oriented. Based on our extensive range of accessory products, brands, distribution channels and price points, we are able to target style-conscious consumers across a wide age spectrum on a global basis. Domestically, we sell our products through a diversified distribution network that includes department stores, specialty retail locations, specialty watch and jewelry stores, Company-owned retail and outlet stores, mass market stores, through our FOSSIL website and third party websites. Our wholesale customer base includes, among others, Amazon, Best Buy, Dillard's, JCPenney, Kohl's, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Target and Wal-Mart. In the U.S., our network of Company-owned stores included 59 retail stores located in premier retail sites and 101 outlet stores located in major outlet malls as of December 28, 2019 . In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products on our website, www.fossil.com , as well as proprietary and licensed watch and jewelry brands through other managed and affiliated websites. Internationally, our products are sold to department stores, specialty retail stores, specialty watch and jewelry stores and through third party websites in approximately 150 countries worldwide through 23 Company-owned foreign sales subsidiaries and through a network of approximately 80 independent distributors. Internationally, our network of Company-owned stores included 162 retail stores and 122 outlet stores as of December 28, 2019 . Our products are also sold through licensed and franchised FOSSIL retail stores, retail concessions operated by us and kiosks in certain international markets. In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products on our websites in certain countries. Our consolidated gross profit margin is impacted by our diversified business model that includes, but is not limited to: (i) a significant number of product categories we distribute, (ii) the multiple brands we offer within several product categories, (iii) the geographical presence of our businesses and (iv) the different distribution channels we sell to or through. The components of this diversified business model produce varying ranges of gross profit margin. Generally, on a historical basis, our fashion branded watch and jewelry offerings produce higher gross profit margins than our leather goods offerings. In addition, in most product categories that we offer, brands with higher retail price points generally produce higher gross profit margins compared to those of lower retail priced brands and connected products carry relatively lower margins than traditional products. Gross profit margins related to sales in our Europe and Asia businesses are historically higher than our Americas business, primarily due to the following factors: (i) premiums charged in comparison to retail prices on products sold in the U.S.; (ii) the product sales mix in our international businesses, in comparison to our Americas business, is comprised more predominantly of watches and jewelry that generally produce higher gross profit margins than leather goods; and (iii) the watch sales mix in our Europe and Asia businesses, in comparison to our Americas business, are comprised more predominantly of higher priced licensed brands. Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing supply. Certain key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, which exposes us to potential supply shortages that could disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products. Any interruption or delay in the supply of key components could significantly harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and cause us to lose sales. Interruptions or delays in supply may be caused by a number of factors that are outside of our and our contractor manufacturers' control. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included therewith. 31 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to product returns, bad debt, inventories, long-lived asset impairment, impairment of trade names, income taxes, warranty costs and litigation liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant estimates and judgments. Product Returns. We accept limited returns from customers. We monitor returns and maintain a provision for estimated returns based upon historical experience and any specific issues identified. While returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past. In the event that our products are performing poorly in the retail market and/or we experience product damages or defects at a rate significantly higher than our historical rate, the resulting returns could have an adverse impact on the operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur. If our allowance for product returns were to change by 10%, the impact, excluding taxes, would have been an approximate $3.8 million change to net income (loss). Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, including any applicable duty and freight charges. We account for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the average cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about forecasted sales demand, market conditions and available liquidation channels. Valuation of existing connected inventory can be negatively impacted by the emergence of newer generation product. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if liquidation channels are not readily available, additional inventory valuation reductions may be required. We assess our off-price sales on an ongoing basis and update our estimates accordingly. Revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers, delivery has occurred and in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for the product. Impairment of Trade Names. We evaluate indefinite-lived trade names by comparing the fair value of the asset to its recorded value annually as of the end of the fiscal year and whenever events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of the trade name may not be recoverable. The fair value of the asset is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value analysis, actual results may differ, which could alter the fair value of the trade names and possibly cause impairment charges to occur in future periods. Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimate of future cash flows used to determine the estimate of our fair values. The most significant assumptions associated with the fair value calculations include net sales growth rates and discount rates. If the actual future sales results do not meet the assumed growth rates, future impairments of trade names may be incurred. For fiscal year 2019 , a discount rate of 10.2% and a royalty rate of 5% were used to estimate the MICHELE trade name fair value. The MICHELE trade name represented approximately 71%, 34% and 29% of our total trade name balances at the end of fiscal years 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. No impairment charges were recorded to the MICHELE trade name in fiscal years 2019 or 2018 and $7.6 million of impairment charges were recorded in fiscal year 2017 . As of December 28, 2019 , the fair value of the MICHELE trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 70%. In fiscal year 2019, as a result of interim impairment testing, the Company recorded impairment charges of $16.6 million related to the SKAGEN trade name fair value. Concurrent with the impairment testing, the Company determined the trade name would no longer have an indefinite useful life. As a result of the change in estimate, the useful life of the trade name changed from indefinite to definite, and the trade name is being fully amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 6 years. The SKAGEN trade name represented approximately 29%, 66% and 71% of our total trade name balance at the end of fiscal years 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. We recorded impairment charges of $6.2 million and $28.3 million for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 , respectively, related to the SKAGEN trade name. The MISFIT trade name was being amortized over its estimated useful life; however, during fiscal year 2017, the trade name was deemed not recoverable, resulting in an impairment charge of $11.8 million. Property, Plant and Equipment and Lease Impairment. We test for asset impairment of property, plant and equipment and lease assets whenever events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable based on 32 Table of Contents expected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, we calculate fair value using our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. When undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated through the operations of our Company-owned retail stores are less than the carrying value of the underlying assets, the assets are impaired. If it is determined that assets are impaired, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the asset's book value exceeds its fair value. Should actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated, additional losses may be recorded. We recorded impairment losses in selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") of approximately $7.9 million in fiscal year 2019 related to lease assets. We recorded impairment losses in SG&A of approximately $0.7 million , $1.9 million and $1.3 million in fiscal years 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, related to property, plant and equipment. We recorded impairment losses in restructuring charges of approximately $1.7 million in fiscal year 2019 related to lease assets. We recorded impairment losses in restructuring charges of approximately $0.6 million , $1.7 million and $8.0 million in fiscal years 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, related to property, plant and equipment. In fiscal year 2019 , an increase of 100 basis points to the discount rate would have increased property, plant and equipment and lease impairment expense by $0.1 million. A 10% decrease in future expected cash flows would have increased impairment expense by $3.6 million. We recorded non-impairment restructuring charges related to the write off of property, plant and equipment of approximately $0.5 million , $0.6 million and $0.4 million in fiscal years 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. I ncome Taxes. We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740"). Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. The valuation allowance for fiscal years 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $118.1 million , $95.8 million and $78.3 million, respectively. In addition, in fiscal year 2019, we recorded a state deferred tax liability of $0.3 million on foreign earnings not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. Our continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. We accrue an amount for our estimate of additional income tax liability which we believe we are more likely than not to incur as a result of the ultimate resolution of tax audits ("uncertain tax positions"). We review and update the estimates used in the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities, upon completion of tax audits, upon expiration of statutes of limitation, or upon occurrence of other events. The results of operations and financial position for future periods could be impacted by changes in assumptions or resolutions of tax audits. The GILTI provisions of the Tax Act, requiring the inclusion of certain foreign earnings in U.S. taxable income, increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 and 2019 and could have an adverse impact in future years. Due to the complexity of these new tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate these provisions of the Tax Act as the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department issue guidance and regulations. The GILTI impact will be accounted for as incurred under the period cost method. In addition, our valuation allowance analysis is affected by various aspects of the Tax Act, including the limitation on the deductibility of interest expense and the impact of the GILTI. Those adjustments materially impacted the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in fiscal 2019. Warranty Costs. Our watch products are covered by limited warranties against defects in materials or workmanship. Historically, our FOSSIL and RELIC watch products sold in the U.S. have been covered for warranty periods of 11 years and 12 years, respectively, and our SKAGEN branded watches have been covered by a lifetime warranty. Beginning in 2017, these brands are covered by a two year warranty. Generally, all other products, including leathers and jewelry, sold in the U.S. and internationally are covered by a comparable one to two year warranty. At the time of sale, we accrue a warranty liability for estimated costs in connection with future warranty claims. We determine our warranty liability using historical warranty repair experience. We periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty liability, and as changes occur in sales volumes and warranty costs, the warranty accrual is adjusted as necessary. Actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated, as the number and value of warranty claims can vary due to such factors as performance of new products, significant manufacturing or design defects not discovered until after the product is delivered to customers, product failure rates, and higher or lower than expected service costs for a repair. We believe that analysis of historical trends and knowledge of potential manufacturing or design problems provide sufficient information to establish a reasonable estimate for warranty claims at the time of sale. However, since we cannot predict with certainty future warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims, our actual warranty costs may differ. 33 Table of Contents Due to the nature of connected products, their warranty costs are usually more than traditional products. A shift in product mix from traditional to connected products generally results in an increase in warranty liabilities. The year-end warranty liability for fiscal years 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $23.1 million , $22.8 million and $19.4 million , respectively. Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards See Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements, which are contained in Item 8 of this report and are incorporated by reference herein. Results of Operations Executive Summary During fiscal year 2019 , net sales decreased 13% ( 11% in constant currency) as compared to fiscal year 2018. We generated a net loss of $52 million in fiscal year 2019, as compared to a net loss of $3 million in fiscal year 2018. Consistent with the recent past, the operating environment has continued to be challenging as consumer interests and shopping patterns in the watch and accessory categories evolve. We continue to see softness, principally in the wholesale channel in the U.S. and Europe and within traditional watches, which is largely reflective of both the ongoing shift from brick and mortar to e-commerce and the consumer preference shift to connected product. Partially offsetting our trends in the Americas and Europe is our growth in Asia, particularly in China and India. While demand for our latest generation product has been positive, we expected to drive sales through our older Gen 4 product offerings as a lower tiered pricing option, especially during the fiscal 2019 holiday season. Due to a combination of competitive pricing in the marketplace for older generation product and our Gen 5 offering appealing to consumers as a better value, we fell short of our goals in fiscal 2019. This softness pressured our margins and drove operating profits significantly below expectations. Although we faced considerable headwinds in fiscal 2019, we executed against our strategic priorities and made significant progress under our restructuring programs throughout the year. The New World Fossil ("NWF") restructuring program we began in fiscal year 2016 ("NWF 1.0") was completed during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 and delivered $200 million of run-rate cost savings over a three year period. The program has been critical to our ability to reduce costs while also funding investments such as digital marketing capabilities and product innovation. We are continuing to optimize our operating model under NWF 2.0 - Transform to Grow ("NWF 2.0"). The program will be even more critical to our ability to invest in the business and reduce costs. As disruption continues across retail and consumer shopping behavior evolves, there are significant opportunities to capture market share in the growing watch market. Capitalizing on those market share opportunities will require investments and a reallocation of resources which we will fund through NWF 2.0. Within the NWF 2.0 program, we see significant opportunities to drive value within our revenue management, supply chain, and procurement processes. We are also taking a zero-based budgeting approach across the organization in order to rework our business model and create organizational and operational efficiencies. Given the structural changes occurring across the industry and within our business in particular, we have been pivoting our model accordingly. We are deploying greater resources to the direct channel for both our owned and licensed businesses. We have been accelerating our connected product offerings and successfully driving growth in key Asian markets including China and India. Equally important, we are taking actions to strengthen our operations and build scale as we evolve our model in tandem with industry dynamics. During fiscal year 2019, sales of FOSSIL branded products decreased 10% (8% in constant currency), as compared to fiscal year 2018, with declines across all product categories. FOSSIL brand watch sales decreased 8% (6% in constant currency) during fiscal year 2019, driven by declines in Americas and Europe while Asia increased modestly. Our FOSSIL connected business grew modestly, driven by sales increases in Europe and Asia partially offset by declines in Americas. Our multi-brand global watch portfolio declined 11% ( 9% in constant currency) during fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, with traditional watch sales declining high single digits in constant currency. MICHAEL KORS watch sales decreased 22% (20% in constant currency) with decreases in all segments. While most brands in the portfolio decreased, EMPORIO ARMANI posted strong growth, driven by third party e-commerce and wholesale growth in China. During fiscal year 2019, our connected watch business delivered $323 million in sales, representing 18% of total watch sales for the year. Excluding store closures and business exits, our core sales declined high single digits, primarily driven by lower sales in our wholesale channel. Global comparable retail sales, including our stores and our own e-commerce, declined 4% for fiscal year 2019 with sales declines across all regions and product categories. Double-digit positive international e-commerce comparable sales were more than offset by comparable sales declines in Americas e-commerce and declines in Company full-price stores. 34 Table of Contents During fiscal year 2019, our gross profit margin rate decreased 310 basis points to 49.6% compared to 52.7% in the prior fiscal year, largely driven by inventory valuation adjustments, of which $38 million were recorded in fiscal year 2019 primarily for excess levels of older generation connected watches, increased product costs including tariffs and freight, and an unfavorable currency impact of approximately 60 basis points. These additional costs were partially offset by higher margin sales growth in Asia and benefits from our NWF initiatives. Other income (expense) increased favorably primarily due to a $21.6 million gain on the sale of intellectual property to Google and net foreign currency gains during fiscal 2019 as compared to net losses in fiscal year 2018. During fiscal year 2019, our financial performance resulted in a net loss of $1.04 per diluted share and included NWF restructuring charges of $0.47 per diluted share and non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $0.25 per diluted share. During fiscal year 2018, our financial performance resulted in a loss of $0.07 per diluted share and included NWF restructuring charges of $0.75 per diluted share and non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $0.10 per diluted share. Currencies, including both translation and the impact of foreign currency hedging contracts, unfavorably impacted the earnings comparison for fiscal year 2019 by $0.18 per diluted share. As we look at 2020, we are focusing on four strategic priorities structured to drive operational efficiency in 2020 and with the goal of beginning to stabilize the net sales trajectory and building scale in 2021. Priority number one is delivering exceptional story-telling and innovation. The path forward to changing our sales trajectory will come first and foremost from product innovation and creativity. Priority number two is driving commercial transformation. We are moving quickly to improve our digital capabilities, including but not limited to, our multi-brand omni-channel capabilities, digital marketing and CRM, to analysis, targeting and retention. The implementation of our new e-commerce platform is in process now and brings us a set of tools to support a larger direct to consumer business in the coming years. Our third strategic priority is to expand our presence in China and India. Our fourth priority is strengthening our supply chain. We have a significant opportunity to improve our end-to-end manufacturing and distribution capabilities, which will allow us to reduce lead times, lower costs and enhance our overall competitiveness. We remain confident in our strategies and believe we have the talent and operating platform to achieve our goals. Constant Currency Financial Information As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The translation of the operations of our foreign-based entities from their local currencies into U.S. dollars is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and can have a significant impact on our reported financial results. In general, our overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business. As a result, in addition to presenting financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), our discussion contains references to constant currency financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate net sales on a constant currency basis, net sales for the current fiscal year for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average rates during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. We present constant currency information to provide investors with a basis to evaluate how our underlying business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The constant currency financial information presented herein should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between constant currency financial information and the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included where applicable. Fiscal Year 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year 2018 Consolidated Net Sales. Net sales decreased $323.8 million or 12.7% ( 10.8% in constant currency) for fiscal year 2019 , as compared to fiscal year 2018 . Global watch sales decreased $230.5 million or 11.3% ( 9.4% in constant currency), with declines in most brands in our portfolio and partially offset by growth in EMPORIO ARMANI. Our leathers business decreased $50.8 million or 17.6% ( 16.1% in constant currency). Our jewelry category decreased $44.6 million or 26.6% ( 24.1% in constant currency), mostly as a result of a decrease in sales of MICHAEL KORS branded products during fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 . Our most significant declines were in wholesale watches in the Americas and Europe segments. During fiscal year 2019, sales results were negatively impacted by store closures, less off-price and liquidation sales and licensed brand exits. Global comparable retail sales declined moderately for fiscal year 2019, with negative comparable sales in stores and e-commerce. Double-digit positive international e-commerce comparable sales were more than offset by comparable sales declines in Americas e-commerce and declines in Company full-price stores.

Americas net sales decreased $224.5 million or 19.1% ( 19.0% in constant currency), largely driven by decreases in watches. During fiscal year 2019 , our multi-brand watch portfolio decreased $167.3 million or 17.9% ( 17.7% in constant currency), with declines across nearly all brands and the largest decreases in MICHAEL KORS and FOSSIL. Sales also declined due to the termination of the BURBERRY and MARC JACOBS licenses. Our leathers category decreased $26.2 million or 15.3% ( 15.0% in constant currency), mainly driven by FOSSIL branded products and our jewelry business decreased $25.5 million or 50.7% ( 50.9% in constant currency), mostly driven by MICHAEL KORS branded product. Within the region, sales declined in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Comparable retail sales decreased moderately in the region, with negative comparable sales in full price stores, outlet stores and e-commerce.

During fiscal year 2019 , Europe net sales decreased $140.8 million or 16.4% ( 12.8% in constant currency). Our multi-brand watch portfolio decreased $99.3 million or 15.1% ( 11.5% in constant currency), our leathers business decreased $20.0 million or 29.7% ( 26.3% in constant currency) and our jewelry category decreased $18.7 million or 16.8% ( 13.1% in constant currency) in fiscal year 2019 , as compared to fiscal year 2018. During fiscal year 2019, most of the brands in the portfolio declined, driven by weakness in the wholesale channel and retail store closures. Sales decreased in all markets, most notably in the U.K. and Germany. Comparable retail sales were modestly negative during fiscal year 2019, with positive comparable sales in e-commerce more than offset by negative comparable sales in our store concepts. 36 Table of Contents The following table sets forth product net sales and the changes in product net sales on both a reported and constant currency basis from period to period for the Europe segment (dollars in millions): Net Sales Fiscal Year Growth (Decline) Percentage as Reported Percentage Constant Currency 2019 2018 Dollars Watches $ 557.5 $ 656.8 $ (99.3 ) (15.1 )% (11.5 )% Leathers 47.3 67.3 (20.0 ) (29.7 ) (26.3 ) Jewelry 92.9 111.6 (18.7 ) (16.8 ) (13.1 ) Other 17.8 20.6 (2.8 ) (13.6 ) (8.7 ) Total $ 715.5 $ 856.3 $ (140.8 ) (16.4 )% (12.8 )% Asia Net Sales.

Our watch category increased $36.4 million or 8.3% ( 11.5% in constant currency), our leathers products decreased $4.6 million or 9.1% ( 6.6% in constant currency), and our jewelry business decreased $0.5 million or 8.5% ( 6.8% in constant currency). In our watch portfolio, we had strong sales growth in EMPORIO ARMANI products and modest growth in ARMANI EXCHANGE and FOSSIL, while most other brands declined. Fiscal year 2019 sales were negatively impacted by the termination of the MARC JACOBS and BURBERRY licenses. Within the region, we had strong sales growth in mainland China and India, which were partially offset by sales decreases in Taiwan (China), Japan and Australia. For fiscal year 2019, comparable retail sales decreased modestly, with positive comparable sales in our e-commerce business offset by negative comparable sales in our stores.

Both stores and e-commerce sites are included in comparable retail sales in the thirteenth month of operation. Stores that experience a gross square footage increase of 10% or more due to an expansion and/or relocation are removed from the comparable store sales base, but are included in total sales. These stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the expansion and/or relocation. Comparable retail sales also exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. 37 Table of Contents Gross Profit. Gross profit in fiscal year 2019 was $1.1 billion or 49.6% of net sales compared to $1.3 billion or 52.7% in fiscal year 2018 . The decrease in gross profit of $0.2 billion was primarily due to decreased net sales and a lower gross margin percentage. The gross margin percentage decreased 310 basis points in 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 , largely driven by inventory valuation adjustments, of which $38 million were recorded in fiscal year 2019 primarily for excess levels of older generation connected watches, increased product costs including tariffs and freight and an unfavorable currency impact of approximately 60 basis points. These costs were partially offset by higher margin sales growth in Asia and benefits from our NWF initiatives. Operating Expenses. For fiscal year 2019 , total operating expenses decreased by $149.6 million and, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 50.9% , compared to 50.3% in fiscal year 2018 . SG&A expenses were $143.0 million lower in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 mainly due to corporate and regional infrastructure reductions driven by our NWF initiatives and lower store costs due to store closures. During fiscal year 2019, we incurred restructuring costs of $29.6 million under our NWF initiatives compared with restructuring costs of $46.6 million in fiscal year 2018. We incurred non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $16.6 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to $6.2 million in fiscal year 2018. The translation of foreign-denominated expenses during fiscal year 2019 decreased operating expenses by approximately $22.3 million as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 48.8% in fiscal year 2019 as compared to 48.2% in fiscal year 2018. Consolidated Operating Income (Loss). Operating income (loss) was $(28.4) million in fiscal year 2019 , as compared to $62.7 million in the prior fiscal year, primarily driven by decreased sales volume and gross margin rate, partially offset by decreased operating expenses. Within operating expenses, SG&A decreased $143.0 million driven by corporate and regional infrastructure reductions and lower store costs due to store closures, restructuring charges decreased $17.0 million , and trade name impairment increased $10.4 million . The gross margin rate decreased largely driven by (i) inventory valuation adjustments, of which $38 million were recorded in fiscal year 2019, primarily for excess levels of older generation connected watches, (ii) increased product costs, including tariffs and freight and (iii) an unfavorable currency impact of approximately 60 basis points. These costs were partially offset by higher margin sales growth in Asia and benefits from our NWF initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin decreased to (1.3)% in fiscal year 2019 as compared to 2.5% in fiscal year 2018 . Operating income (loss) by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Fiscal Year Growth (Decline) Operating Margin % 2019 2018 Dollars Percentage 2019 2018 Americas $ 66.7 $ 185.1 $ (118.4 ) (64.0 )% 7.0 % 15.8 % Europe 88.3 129.6 (41.3 ) (31.9 ) 12.3 15.1 Asia 101.2 87.5 13.7 15.7 18.9 17.3 Corporate (284.6 ) (339.5 ) 54.9 (16.2 ) Total operating income (loss) $ (28.4 ) $ 62.7 $ (91.1 ) (145.3 )% (1.3 )% 2.5 % Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $12.6 million in fiscal year 2019 , as a result of a smaller borrowing base. Other Income (Expense) Net. During fiscal year 2019 , other income (expense) - net was income of $27.0 million compared to loss of $38,000 the prior fiscal year. This change was primarily driven by a $21.6 million gain on the sale of intellectual property to Google and net foreign currency gains during fiscal year 2019 as compared to net losses in the prior fiscal year. Other income in fiscal year 2019 was partially offset by a $3.0 million loss on the extinguishment of debt. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense for fiscal year 2019 was $18.7 million , resulting in an effective tax rate of (59.6)% , compared to 104.7% in fiscal year 2018 . The 2019 effective rate was negatively impacted by the accrual of valuation allowances on U.S. net deferred tax assets and the inclusion of foreign income taxed in the U.S. which was partially offset by certain favorable permanent differences and the release of foreign valuation allowances. The 2018 effective rate was negatively impacted by the accrual of valuation allowances on U.S. and some foreign net deferred tax assets as well as the inclusion of foreign income taxed in the U.S. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. Fiscal year 2019 net income (loss) attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. was a net loss of $1.04 per diluted share in comparison to a net loss of $0.07 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year. Fiscal year 2019 included restructuring charges of $0.47 per diluted share and non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $0.25 per diluted share. In comparison, fiscal year 2018 included restructuring charges of $0.75 per diluted share and non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $0.10 per diluted share. Fiscal year 2019 net income (loss) attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. was negatively impacted by a decline in gross margin, partially offset by reduced operating expenses and a $21.6 million 38 Table of Contents gain on the sale of intellectual property to Google in fiscal year 2019. Currencies, including both the translation impact on operating earnings and the impact of foreign currency hedging contracts, unfavorably affected the year-over-year diluted earnings (loss) per share comparison by $0.18 . Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017 For a discussion of our results of operations in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, please see Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 filed with the SEC. 39 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of fiscal year 2019 was $200.2 million , including $189.7 million held by foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S., in comparison to $403.4 million at the end of fiscal year 2018 , including $274.6 million held by foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S. Historically, our business operations have not required substantial cash during the first several months of our fiscal year. Generally, starting in the third quarter, our cash needs begin to increase, typically reaching a peak in the September-November time frame as we increase inventory levels in advance of the holiday season. Our quarterly cash requirements are also impacted by debt repayments, restructuring charges, strategic investments such as acquisitions and other capital expenditures. We believe that cash flows from operations combined with existing cash on hand and amounts available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the next twelve months. For fiscal year 2019 , we used $14.2 million of cash to fund our operations. A net loss of $50.0 million and an increase in working capital items of $177.3 million was partially offset by net non-cash items of $213.1 million . Non-cash items primarily consisted of non-cash lease expense of $120.0 million and depreciation, amortization and accretion charges of $54.8 million . Accounts receivable decreased by 11.7% to $289.7 million at the end of fiscal year 2019 compared to $328.0 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. Average days sales outstanding for our wholesale business for fiscal year 2019 decreased two days as compared to fiscal year 2018 . Inventory at the end of fiscal year 2019 was $452.3 million , representing an increase of 19.8% from the prior fiscal year inventory balance of $377.6 million primarily driven by sales under-performance of older generation connected watches in fiscal year 2019. At the end of fiscal year 2019 , we had working capital of $500.3 million compared to working capital of $652.8 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. Additionally, at the end of fiscal year 2019 , we had approximately $26.2 million of outstanding short-term borrowings and $178.8 million in long-term debt. For the fiscal year ending January 2, 2021, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $25 million. Of this amount, we expect approximately 40% will be for retail store expansion and renovation, approximately 30% will be for strategic growth, including investments in omni-channel, global concessions and technology, and approximately 30% will be for technology and facilities maintenance. Our capital expenditure budget and allocation of it to the foregoing investments are estimates and are subject to change. We believe that cash flows from operations combined with existing cash on hand and amounts available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months. Debt Facilities On September 26, 2019, we, as the U.S. borrower, and certain of our foreign subsidiaries, as the non-U.S. borrowers, and certain of our other subsidiaries from time to time party thereto designated as borrowers (collectively the ABL Borrowers ), and certain of our subsidiaries from time to time party thereto as guarantors, entered into the Revolving Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent (the ABL Agent ), J.P. Morgan AG, as French collateral agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citizens Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers, and Citizens Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-syndication agents and each of the lenders from time to time party thereto (the ABL Lenders ). In addition, on September 26, 2019, we, as borrower, entered into a term credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent (the Term Agent ), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citizens Bank, National Association and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers and the lenders party thereto (the Term Loan Lenders ), which was amended on February 20, 2020, by that certain Amendment No. 1 to Term Credit Agreement. Contemporaneously with entering into the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan Facility, on September 26, 2019, the proceeds of the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan Facility were used to pay off in full the $275.8 million in aggregate outstanding principal amount of the loans, interest, fees, expenses and other obligations under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of January 29, 2018 (the Prior Credit Agreement ). We recorded a loss of $3.0 million in other income (expense) - net during fiscal 2019 for debt issuance costs associated with the Prior Credit Agreement. The Revolving Facility provides that the ABL Lenders may extend revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $275.0 million at any time outstanding (the Revolving Credit Commitment ), of which up to $160.0 million is available under a U.S. facility, an aggregate of $70.0 million is available under a European facility, $30.0 million is available under a Hong Kong facility, $10.0 million will be available under a French facility, and $5.0 million is available under a Canadian facility, in each case, subject to the borrowing base availability limitations described below. The Revolving Facility also includes an up to $45.0 million subfacility for the issuance of letters of credit (the Letters of Credit ). The Revolving 40 Table of Contents Facility expires and is due and payable on September 26, 2024, provided that, if on the date that is the 121st day prior to the final maturity date of any class or tranche of term loans under the Term Credit Agreement, any such term loans are outstanding on such date, then the maturity date of the Revolving Facility shall be such date. Unless the maturity of the term loans is extended beyond the current maturity date of September 26, 2024, the Revolving Facility will expire and be due and payable on May 28, 2024. The French facility includes a $1.0 million subfacility for swingline loans, and the European facility includes a $7.0 million subfacility for swingline loans. The Revolving Facility is subject to a line cap (the Line Cap ) equal to the lesser of the total Revolving Credit Commitment and the aggregate borrowing bases under the U.S. facility, the European facility, the Hong Kong facility, the French facility and the Canadian facility. The loans under the Revolving Facility were used to repay the Prior Credit Agreement, as described above, pay transaction expenses and for general corporate purposes. Loans under the Revolving Facility may be made in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euros, Hong Kong dollars or pounds sterling. The Revolving Facility is an asset-based facility, in which borrowing availability is subject to a borrowing base equal to: (a) with respect to us, the sum of (i) the lesser of (x) 90% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible U.S. finished goods inventory and (y) 65% of the lower of cost or market value of eligible U.S. finished goods inventory, plus (ii) 85% of the eligible U.S. accounts receivable, plus (iii) 90% of eligible U.S. credit card accounts receivable, minus (iv) the aggregate amount of reserves, if any, established by the ABL Agent; (b) with respect to each non-U.S. borrower (except for the French Borrower), the sum of (i) the lesser of (x) 90% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible foreign finished goods inventory of such non-U.S. borrower and (y) 65% of the lower of cost or market value of eligible foreign finished goods inventory of such non-U.S. borrower, plus (ii) 85% of the eligible foreign accounts receivable of such non-U.S. borrower, minus (iii) the aggregate amount of reserves, if any, established by the ABL Agent; and (c) with respect to the French Borrower, (i) 85% of eligible French accounts receivable minus (ii) the aggregate amount of reserves, if any, established by the ABL Agent. Not more than 60% of the aggregate borrowing base under the Revolving Facility may consist of the non-U.S. borrowing bases. Eurodollar loans under the U.S. facility will bear interest at the adjusted LIBO rate plus the applicable rate, and Eurodollar loans under the Canadian facility, European facility, French facility and Hong Kong facility will bear interest at the LIBO rate plus the applicable rate. Base rate loans under the U.S. facility will bear interest at the alternate base rate plus the applicable rate. Under the Canadian facility, Canadian prime rate loans will bear interest at the Canadian prime rate plus the applicable rate, and Canadian dollar loans will bear interest at the CDOR rate plus the applicable rate. Under the Hong Kong facility, Hong Kong dollar loans will bear interest at the HIBOR rate plus the applicable rate. Each swingline loan shall bear interest at the overnight LIBO rate plus the applicable rate for overnight LIBO rate loans. The applicable rate varies from 1.25% to 1.75% for adjusted LIBO, CDOR and HIBOR rate loans and from 0.25% to 0.75% for alternate base rate and Canadian prime rate loans depending on our average daily excess availability under the Revolving Facility for the most recently ended fiscal quarter, which is an amount equal to (x)(1) the lesser of the total revolving commitments then in effect and (2) the aggregate borrowing base, minus (y) the total credit exposure of all ABL Lenders at such time. The Revolving Facility also includes a commitment fee, payable quarterly in arrears, of 0.250% or 0.375% determined by reference to the average daily unused portion of the overall commitment under the Revolving Facility. The ABL Borrowers will pay the ABL Agent, on the account of the issuing ABL Lenders, an issuance fee of 0.125% for any issued letters of credit. The ABL Borrowers are permitted to voluntarily prepay the revolving loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. The ABL Borrowers may reduce the commitments at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, in a minimum aggregate principal amount of not less than $5.0 million or increments of $1.0 million in excess thereof. If the total amount of outstanding revolving loans and Letters of Credit exceeds the total commitment under the Revolving Facility, the ABL Borrowers must prepay the revolving loans in an amount equal to such excess. During any periods (each, a Covenant Period ) while availability under the Revolving Facility is less than the greater of (x) 15% of the Line Cap and (y) $30.0 million, we will be subject to a financial covenant which requires us to not permit the fixed charge coverage ratio to be less than 1.00 to 1.00 on the first day of such Covenant Period or the last day of each fiscal quarter during such Covenant Period. The ABL Borrowers have the right to request an increase to the commitments under the Revolving Facility or any subfacility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $75.0 million in increments no less than $10.0 million, subject to certain terms and conditions as defined in the Revolving Facility, including that the Term Loan Facility has been amended, restated or otherwise modified to permit any additional commitments. The Revolving Facility is secured by guarantees by us and certain of our domestic subsidiaries. Additionally, we and our subsidiaries have granted liens on all or substantially all of our assets in order to secure the obligations under the Revolving Facility. In addition, the non-U.S. borrowers from time to time party to the Revolving Facility are required to enter into 41 Table of Contents security instruments with respect to all or substantially all of their assets that can be pledged under applicable local law, and certain of their respective subsidiaries may guarantee the respective non-U.S. obligations under the Revolving Facility. The Revolving Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, such as compliance with annual audited and quarterly unaudited financial statements disclosures. Upon an event of default, the ABL Agent will have the right to declare the revolving loans and other obligations outstanding immediately due and payable and all commitments immediately terminated or reduced, subject to cure periods and grace periods set forth in the Revolving Facility. The Term Loan Facility provides for term loans to us in the aggregate principal amount of $200 million. Proceeds from the Term Loan Facility were reduced by a $12.0 million original issue discount, which is presented as a reduction of the Term Loan Facility on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the term loan. The term loans under the Term Loan Facility bore interest at (a) the adjusted LIBO rate plus 6.50% for Eurodollar loans or (b) the alternate base rate plus 5.50% for alternate base rate loans as of December 28, 2019. In connection with the amendment entered into on February 20, 2020, the term loans under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at (a) the adjusted LIBO rate plus 8.00% for Eurodollar loans or (b) the alternate base rate plus 7.00% for alternate base rate loans. The Term Loan Facility amortizes in quarterly installments in an aggregate amount equal (x) to 2.50% of its original principal amount until September 30, 2021 and, thereafter, (y) to 3.75% of its original principal amount until June 30, 2024. The Term Loan Facility expires and is due and payable on September 26, 2024, subject to possible extensions. We are permitted to voluntarily prepay the term loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty; provided, that if we voluntarily prepay the term loans prior to February 20, 2022 or if we incur certain indebtedness which results in a mandatory prepayment under the Term Loan Facility prior to February 20, 2022, we are required to pay a prepayment fee of 2.00% with respect to the principal amount prepaid prior to February 20, 2021 and 1.00% with respect to the principal amount prepaid between February 21, 2021 and February 20, 2022. The foregoing prepayment premiums are also payable upon an acceleration of the Term Loan Facility during these periods as well. The Term Loan Facility will be required to be prepaid with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, insurance and condemnation events, debt and equity issuances, cash dividends received from certain of our subsidiaries and an annual excess cash flow sweep. In connection with the amendment entered into on February 20, 2020, the maximum total leverage ratio was revised to increase the maximum total leverage ratio permitted under the covenant from 1.50 to 1.00 as of December 28, 2019 to (i) 2.75 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending April 4, 2020, July 4, 2020, October 3, 2020 and January 2, 2021, (ii) 2.25 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending April 3, 2021, July 3, 2021 and October 2, 2021, and (iii) 1.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of each subsequent fiscal quarter. The Term Loan Facility also limits the Revolving Credit Commitment under the Revolving Facility to the lesser of the borrowing base or $200.0 million. A payment default under the Revolving Facility triggers a cross default under the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility is secured by guarantees by us and certain of our domestic subsidiaries. Additionally, we and such subsidiaries have granted liens on all or substantially all of their assets in order to secure the obligations under the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default such as compliance with annual audited and quarterly unaudited financial statements disclosures. Upon an event of default, the Term Agent will have the right to declare the term loans and other obligations outstanding immediately due and payable and all commitments immediately terminated or reduced, subject to cure periods and grace periods set forth in the Term Loan Facility. The obligations under the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan Facility are governed by a customary intercreditor agreement (the Intercreditor Agreement ). The Intercreditor Agreement specifies that (i) the Term Loan Facility is secured by (a) a perfected first priority security interest in U.S. fixed assets and (b) a perfected second priority security interest in the U.S. liquid assets and accounts receivable, and (ii) the Revolving Facility is secured by (a) a perfected first priority security interest in the U.S. liquid assets and accounts receivable and (b) a perfected second priority security interest in U.S. fixed assets. During fiscal year 2019, we had net payments of $200.0 million under the Term Loan Facility and the term loan under the Prior Credit Agreement at an average annual interest rate of 9.9%. Additionally, we had net borrowings of $28.0 million under the Revolving Facility and revolving credit loans under the Prior Agreement during fiscal year 2019 at an average interest rate of 2.4%. As of December 28, 2019, we had $200.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and $28.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Facility. As of December 28, 2019, we had unamortized debt issuance costs of $14.5 million and an unamortized original issue discount of $11.2 million , which reduce the corresponding debt liability. In addition, we had $2.7 million of outstanding standby Letters of Credit at December 28, 2019. Amounts available under the Revolving Facility are reduced by any amounts outstanding under standby Letters of Credit. As of December 28, 2019, we had $120.1 million 42 Table of Contents available for borrowing under the Revolving Facility. Borrowings under the Revolving Facility were mainly used to fund normal operating expenses, capital expenditures, and refinancing activities. At December 28, 2019, we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to all our credit facilities. Contractual Obligations The following table identifies our contractual obligations as of December 28, 2019 (in thousands): Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years Debt obligations (1) $ 228,217 $ 25,217 $ 52,500 $ 150,500 $ Interest payments on debt (2) 57,542 16,689 26,904 13,949 Minimum royalty payments (3) 233,652 133,129 37,164 38,608 24,751 Finance lease obligations (4) 2,508 1,042 1,466 Operating lease obligations (4) 556,792 116,778 176,331 110,428 153,255 Purchase obligations (5) 333,731 319,043 11,675 3,013 Uncertain tax positions (6) 11,441 11,441 Total contractual obligations (7) (8) $ 1,423,883 $ 623,339 $ 306,040 $ 316,498 $ 178,006 ____________________________________________ (1) Consists of borrowings, excluding contractual interest payments, unamortized debt issuance costs of $14.5 million and original issue discount of $11.2 million.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We are the guarantor for a 3.0 million Swiss franc credit facility agreement entered into by Swiss Technology Components Ltd. ("STC"), our equity method investee. We are obligated to pay up to 3.3 million Swiss francs in the event of default by STC. There are no other off balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed in Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Inflation We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results for fiscal years 2019 , 2018 or 2017 ; however, our business could be affected by inflation in the future. 43 Table of Contents Selected Quarterly Consolidated Financial Data The table below sets forth selected quarterly consolidated financial information. The information is derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements and includes all normal and recurring adjustments that management considers necessary for a fair statement of results for such periods. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period. Certain line items presented in the tables below, when aggregated, may not agree with the corresponding line items on our consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 due to rounding (in thousands, except percentage and per share data).

(2) Included a $16.6 million impairment charge, excluding taxes, related to our Skagen trade name. (3) Included a $6.2 million impairment charge, excluding taxes, related to our Skagen trade name. While the majority of our products are not seasonal in nature, a significant portion of our net sales and operating income is generally derived in the second half of the fiscal year. Our third and fourth quarters, which include the "back to school" and holiday seasons, have historically generated a significant portion of our annual operating income. Connected products appear to be more seasonal than traditional products which may further impact our operational performance in the third and fourth quarters as compared to the first half of the year. The amount of net sales and operating income generated during the first quarter is affected by the levels of inventory held by retailers at the end of the holiday season, as well as general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. In general, lower levels of inventory held by retailers at the end of the holiday season may have a positive impact on our net sales and operating income in the first quarter of the following fiscal year as a result of higher levels of restocking orders placed by retailers. As we expand our e-commerce business and improve productivity in our retail store base, sales from the direct to consumer distribution channel may increase as a percentage of the total sales mix. Based upon the historical seasonality of direct to consumer sales, we believe this expansion could result in higher levels of profitability in the fourth quarter and lower levels of profitability in the first and second quarters when, due to seasonality, it is more difficult to leverage retail store four wall operating costs and back office expenses against a lower level of sales productivity. In addition, new product launches would generally augment the sales and operating expense levels in the quarter the product launch takes place. The results of 44 Table of Contents operations for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors, including retail, economic and monetary conditions, timing of orders or holidays, the timing of investments and the mix of products sold by us.
