ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, and commercializes pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical conditions. We currently have one marketed product: ARCALYST Injection for Subcutaneous Use, which is available for prescription in the United States for the treatment of CAPS, including FCAS and MWS in adults and children 12 and older. We have 11 product candidates in clinical development, including three that are in late-stage (Phase 3). All of these product candidates were discovered in our research laboratories. Our late-stage programs are VEGF Trap-Eye, which is being developed using intraocular delivery for the treatment of serious eye diseases; ARCALYST , which is being developed for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid-lowering treatment; and aflibercept, which is being developed in oncology in collaboration with sanofi-aventis. Our earlier stage clinical programs include the following fully human antibodies, which are being developed in collaboration with sanofi-aventis: REGN727, an antibody to PCSK9 for LDL cholesterol reduction; REGN88, an antibody to IL-6R, which is being developed in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis; REGN668, an antibody to IL-4R, which is being developed in atopic dermatitis and asthma; REGN421, an antibody to Dll4, a novel angiogenesis target, which is being developed in oncology, REGN910, an antibody to ANG2, another novel angiogenesis target, which is being developed in oncology; REGN475, an antibody to NGF, which is being developed for the treatment of pain (currently on clinical hold); and REGN728 and REGN846, two antibodies in clinical development against undisclosed targets. Developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense. Since inception we have not generated any significant sales or profits from the commercialization of ARCALYST or any of our other product candidates. Before significant revenues from the commercialization of ARCALYST or our other product candidates can be realized, we (or our collaborators) must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing research and development and obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries. In addition, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and new developments may render our products and tech nologies uncompetitive or obsolete. 38 From inception on January 8, 1988 through December 31, 2010, we had a cumulative loss of $1.0 billion, principally related to our research and development activities. We expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities, a significant portion of which we expect to be reimbursed by our collaborators. We plan to submit a BLA to the FDA in the first half of 2011 for marketing approval of VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD in the U.S. In addition, Bayer HealthCare intends to submit regulatory applications in the first half of 2011 for marketing approval of VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD in Europe. If we receive positive Phase 3 clinical trial results, we also expect to file for regulatory approval of ARCALYST for the prevention of gout flares and of afl ibercept in one or more oncology indications. We expect to incur substantial costs to prepare for potential commercialization of these late-stage product candidates and, if one or more of these product candidates receive regulatory approval, to fund the launch of the product(s). Thus, we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses over at least the next few years related primarily to our research and development and commercialization activities. Also, our research and development activities outside our collaborations, the costs of which are not reimbursed, may expand and require additional resources. Our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on, among other factors, the scope and progress of our research and development efforts, the progress of our efforts to commercialize our late-stage product candidates, the timing of certain expenses, and the amount of reimbursement that we receive from collaborators. We cannot predict whether or when our late-stage product candidates will receive regulatory approval or, if such approval is received, whether we will be able to successfully commercialize such product(s), or if we do commercialize such product(s), whether or when they may become profitable. A primary driver of our expenses is our number of full-time employees. Our annual average headcount in 2010 was 1,249 compared with 980 in 2009 and 810 in 2008. In 2010, 2009, and 2008 our average headcount increased primarily to support our expanded research and development activities in connection with our antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis. In 2011, we expect our average headcount to increase to approximately 1,600-1,650, primarily to support the further expansion of our research and development activities, especially in connection with our antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis, and activities in connection with preparing for the potential commercialization of our late-stage product candidates. Management of cash flow is extremely important as we continue our research and development activities and prepare for potential commercialization of our late-stage product candidates. Our principal sources of cash to-date have been from (i) sales of common equity, both in public offerings and to our collaborators, including sanofi-aventis, (ii) funding from our collaborators and licensees in the form of up-front and milestone payments, technology licensing payments, and payments for our research and development activities, and (iii) a private placement of convertible debt, which was repaid in full during 2008. The most significant use of our cash is for research and development activities, which include drug discovery, preclinical studies, clinical trials, and the manufacture of drug supplies for preclinical studies and clinical trials. We are reimb ursed for a substantial portion of these research and development activities by our collaborators. A significant use of our cash will also be for activities in connection with preparing for the potential commercialization of our late-stage product candidates. 39 The planning, execution, and results of our clinical programs are significant factors that can affect our operating and financial results. In our clinical programs, key events in 2010 and 2011 to date were, and plans for the remainder of 2011 are, as follows: Clinical Program 2010 and 2011 Events to Date 2011 Plans VEGF Trap-Eye Reported positive 52-week results in the Phase 3 VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 trials in wet AMD Reported positive six-month results in the Phase 3 COPERNICUS trial in CRVO and completed patient enrollment in the Phase 3 GALILEO trial in CRVO Reported positive 24-week and 52-week results from the Phase 2 DME trial (DA VINCI) Initiated a Phase 3 trial in Asia in CNV of the retina as a result of pathologic myopia File for regulatory approval of VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD in the first half of 2011 Report initial six-month data from GALILEO in the first half of 2011 Report two-year data from VIEW 1 and VIEW 2, and one-year data from COPERNICUS in the second half of 2011 If GALILEO is successful, file for regulatory approval of VEGF Trap-Eye in CRVO ARCALYST Reported positive results from PRE-SURGE 1 and completed patient enrollment of PRE-SURGE 2 and RE-SURGE.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: It requires an assumption (or assumptions) regarding a future outcome; and Changes in the estimate or the use of different assumptions to prepare the estimate could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. The critical accounting estimates that impact our financial statements are described below. 41 Revenue Recognition Collaboration Revenue We earn collaboration revenue in connection with collaboration agreements to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms. We currently have collaboration agreements with sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare. The terms of collaboration agreements typically include non-refundable up-front licensing payments, research progress (milestone) payments, and payments for development activities. Non-refundable up-front license payments, where continuing involvement is required of us, are deferred and recognized over the related performance period. We estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each agreement, and adjust the performance periods, if appropriate, based on the applicable facts and circumstances. Payments which are based on achieving a specific substantive performance milestone, involving a degree of risk, are recognized as revenue when the milestone is a chieved and the related payment is due and non-refundable, provided there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone. Substantive performance milestones typically consist of significant achievements in the development life-cycle of the related product candidate, such as completion of clinical trials, filing for approval with regulatory agencies, and approvals by regulatory agencies. In determining whether a payment is deemed to be a substantive performance milestone, we take into consideration (i) the nature, timing, and value of significant achievements in the development life-cycle of the related development product candidate, (ii) the relative level of effort required to achieve the milestone, and (iii) the relative level of risk in achieving the milestone, taking into account the high degree of uncertainty in successfully advancing product candidates in a drug development program and in ultimately attaining an approved drug product. Payments for achieving milestones which are not cons idered substantive are accounted for as license payments and recognized over the related performance period. We enter into collaboration agreements that include varying arrangements regarding which parties perform and bear the costs of research and development activities. We may share the costs of research and development activities with our collaborator, such as in our VEGF Trap-Eye collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, or we may be reimbursed for all or a significant portion of the costs of our research and development activities, such as in our aflibercept and antibody collaborations with sanofi-aventis. We record our internal and third-party development costs associated with these collaborations as research and development expenses. When we are entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion of the research and development expenses that we incur under a collaboration, we record those reimbursable amounts as collaboration revenue proportionately as we recognize our expenses. If the collaboration is a cost-sharing arrangement in which both we and our collaborator perform development work and share costs, in periods when our collaborator incurs development expenses that benefit the collaboration and Regeneron, we also recognize, as additional research and development expense, the portion of the collaborator development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. In connection with non-refundable licensing payments, our performance period estimates are principally based on projections of the scope, progress, and results of our research and development activities. Due to the variability in the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product, changes to development plans as programs progress, and uncertainty in the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, revisions to performance period estimates are likely to occur periodically, and could result in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future. In addition, our estimated performance periods may change if development programs encounter delays or we and our collaborators decide to expand or contract our clinical plans for a drug candidate in various disease indications. Als o, if a collaborator terminates an agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement, we would recognize any unamortized remainder of an up-front or previously deferred payment at the time of the termination. Product Revenue Revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured, and we have no further performance obligations. Revenue and deferred revenue from product sales are recorded net of applicable provisions for prompt pay discounts, product returns, estimated rebates payable under governmental programs (including Medicaid), distributor fees, and other sales-related deductions. We review our estimates of rebates payable each period and record any necessary adjustments in the current period net product sales. 42 Clinical Trial Expenses Clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third-party contractors. We outsource a substantial portion of our clinical trial activities, utilizing external entities such as CROs, independent clinical investigators, and other third-party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies. For each clinical trial that we conduct, certain clinical trial costs are expensed immediately, while others are expensed over time based on the expected total number of patients in the trial, the rate at which patients enter the trial, and the period over which clinical investigators or contract research organizations are expected to provide services. Clinical activities which relate principally to clinical sites and other administrative functions to manage our clinical trials are performed primarily by CROs. CROs typically perform most of the start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, and program management. On a budgeted basis, these start-up costs are typically 10% to 20% of the total contract value. On an actual basis, this percentage range can be significantly wider, as many of our contracts with CROs are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget, while start-up costs for the particular trial may not change materially. These start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are event driven in nature. The remaining activities and re lated costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. In the event of early termination of a clinical trial, we accrue and recognize expenses in an amount based on our estimate of the remaining non-cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial and/or penalties. For clinical study sites, where payments are made periodically on a per-patient basis to the institutions performing the clinical study, we accrue expense on an estimated cost-per-patient basis, based on subject enrollment and activity in each quarter. The amount of clinical study expense recognized in a quarter may vary from period to period based on the duration and progress of the study, the activities to be performed by the sites each quarter, the required level of patient enrollment, the rate at which patients actually enroll in and drop-out of the clinical study, and the number of sites involved in the study. Clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those that have a significant number of sites, require a large number of patients, have complex patient screening requirements, and span multiple years. During the course of a trial, we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. Our estimates and assumptions for clinical expense recognition could differ significantly from our actual results, which could cause material increases or decreases in research and development expenses in future periods when the actual results become known. No material adjustments to our past clinical trial accrual estimates were made during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, or 2008. Stock-based Employee Compensation We recognize stock-based compensation expense for grants of stock option awards and restricted stock to employees and non-employee members of our board of directors under our long-term incentive plans based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. The grant-date fair value of an award is generally recognized as compensation expense over the award requisite service period. We use the Black-Scholes model to compute the estimated fair value of stock option awards. Using this model, fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to (i) expected volatility of our Common Stock price, (ii) the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise (expected lives), (iii) expected dividend yield on our Common Stock, and (iv) risk-free interest rates, which are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options expected lives. Expected volatility has been estimated based on actual movements in our stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent to the options expected lives. Expected lives are principally based on our historical exercise experience with previously issued employ ee and board of directors option grants. The expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future. Stock-based compensation expense also includes an estimate, which is made at the time of grant, of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. This estimate is revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. 43 The assumptions used in computing the fair value of option awards reflect our best estimates but involve uncertainties related to market and other conditions, many of which are outside of our control. Changes in any of these assumptions may materially affect the fair value of stock options granted and the amount of stock-based compensation recognized in future periods. In addition, we have granted performance-based stock option awards which vest based upon the optionee satisfying certain performance and service conditions as defined in the agreements. Potential compensation cost, measured on the grant date, related to these performance options will be recognized only if, and when, we estimate that these options will vest, which is based on whether we consider the options performance conditions to be probable of attainment. Our estimates of the number of performance-based options that will vest will be revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods. Changes in these estimates may materially affect the amount of stock-based compensation that we recognize in future periods related to performance-based options. Marketable Securities We have invested our excess cash primarily in direct obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies, other debt securities guaranteed by the U.S. government, and money market funds that invest in U.S. Government securities. We consider our marketable securities to be available-for-sale, as defined by authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). These assets are carried at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are included in other accumulated comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders equity. If the decline in the value of a marketable security in our investment portfolio is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we write down the security to its current fair value and recognize a loss that may be charged against income. On a quarterly basis, we review our portfolio of marketable securities, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. Such factors include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost, financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market, or industry trends. With respect to debt securities, this review process also includes an evaluation of our intent to sell an individual debt security or our need to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery or maturity. With respect to equity securities, this review process includes an evaluation of our ability and intent to hold the securities until their full value can be recovered. This review is subjective and r equires a high degree of judgment. For example, as a result of our quarterly reviews of our marketable securities portfolio, during 2010, 2009, and 2008 we recorded charges for other-than-temporary impairment of our marketable securities totaling $0.1 million, $0.1 million, and $2.5 million, respectively. Depreciation of Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. In some situations, the life of the asset may be extended or shortened if circumstances arise that would lead us to believe that the estimated life of the asset has changed. The life of leasehold improvements may change based on the extension of lease contracts with our landlords. Changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods. For example, effective in the first quarter of 2010, the estimated useful lives of certain capitalized laboratory and other equipment, which is a component of property, plant, and equipment, were extended. The effect of this change in estimate was to lower deprec iation expense by $4.0 million and to lower our net loss per share by $0.05 for the year ended December 31, 2010. 44 Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 Net Loss Regeneron reported a net loss of $104.5 million, or $1.26 per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to a net loss of $67.8 million, or $0.85 per share (basic and diluted) for 2009. The increase in our net loss in 2010 was principally due to higher research and development expenses, partly offset by higher collaboration revenue in connection with our antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis. Revenues Revenues in 2010 and 2009 consist of the following: (In millions) 2010 2009 Collaboration revenue Sanofi-aventis $ 311.3 $ 247.2 Bayer HealthCare 75.4 67.3 Total collaboration revenue 386.7 314.5 Technology licensing revenue 40.2 40.0 Net product sales 25.3 18.4 Contract research and other revenue 6.9 6.4 Total revenue $ 459.1 $ 379.3 Sanofi-aventis Collaboration Revenue The collaboration revenue we earned from sanofi-aventis, as detailed below, consisted primarily of reimbursement for research and development expenses and recognition of revenue related to non-refundable up-front payments of $105.0 million related to the aflibercept collaboration and $85.0 million related to the antibody collaboration. Years ended December 31, Sanofi-aventis Collaboration Revenue 2010 2009 (In millions) Aflibercept: Regeneron expense reimbursement $ 16.5 $ 26.6 Recognition of deferred revenue related to up-front payments 9.9 9.9 Total aflibercept 26.4 36.5 Antibody: Regeneron expense reimbursement 276.0 198.1 Recognition of deferred revenue related to up-front and other payments 7.3 9.9 Recognition of revenue related to VelociGene agreement 1.6 2.7 Total antibody 284.9 210.7 Total sanofi-aventis collaboration revenue $ 311.3 $ 247.2 Sanofi-aventis reimbursement of our aflibercept expenses decreased in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to lower costs related to internal research activities and manufacturing aflibercept clinical supplies. As of December 31, 2010, $32.6 million of the original $105.0 million of up-front payments related to aflibercept was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods. In 2010, sanofi-aventis reimbursement of our antibody expenses consisted of $137.7 million under the discovery agreement and $138.3 million of development costs under the license agreement, compared to $99.8 million and $98.3 million, respectively, in 2009. The higher reimbursement amounts in 2010 compared to 2009 were due to an increase in our research activities conducted under the discovery agreement and increases in our development activities for antibody candidates under the license agreement. 45 Recognition of deferred revenue related to sanofi-aventis $85.0 million up-front payment decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the November 2009 amendments to expand and extend the companies antibody collaboration. In connection with the November 2009 amendment of the discovery agreement, sanofi-aventis is funding up to $30 million of agreed-upon costs incurred by us to expand our manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer, New York facilities, of which $23.4 million was received or receivable from sanofi-aventis as of December 31, 2010. Revenue related to these payments for such funding from sanofi-aventis is deferred and recognized as collaboration revenue prospectively over the related performance period in conjunction with the recognition of the original $85.0 million up-front payment. As of December 31, 2010, $79.8 million of the sanofi-aventis payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods. In August 2008, we entered into a separate VelociGene agreement with sanofi-aventis. In 2010 and 2009, we recognized $1.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, in revenue related to this agreement. Bayer HealthCare Collaboration Revenue The collaboration revenue we earned from Bayer HealthCare, as detailed below, consisted of cost sharing of Regeneron VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses, substantive performance milestone payments, and recognition of revenue related to a non-refundable $75.0 million up-front payment received in October 2006 and a $20.0 million milestone payment received in August 2007 (which, for the purpose of revenue recognition, was not considered substantive). Years ended Bayer HealthCare Collaboration Revenue December 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 Cost-sharing of Regeneron VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses $ 45.5 $ 37.4 Substantive performance milestone payments 20.0 20.0 Recognition of deferred revenue related to up-front and other milestone payments 9.9 9.9 Total Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue $ 75.4 $ 67.3 Cost-sharing of our VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses with Bayer HealthCare increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher internal development activities and higher clinical development costs in connection with our Phase 3 COPERNICUS trial in CRVO. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we earned two $10.0 million substantive milestone payments from Bayer HealthCare for achieving positive 52-week results in the VIEW 1 study and positive 6-month results in the COPERNICUS study. In July 2009, we earned a $20.0 million substantive performance milestone payment from Bayer HealthCare in connection with the dosing of the first patient in the COPERNICUS study. In connection with the recognition of deferred revenue related to the $75.0 million up-front payment and $20.0 million milestone payment received in August 2007, as of December 31, 2010, $47.0 million of thes e payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods. Technology Licensing Revenue In connection with our VelocImmune license agreements with AstraZeneca and Astellas, each of the $20.0 million annual, non-refundable payments were deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue ratably over approximately the ensuing year of each agreement. In both 2010 and 2009, we recognized $40.0 million of technology licensing revenue related to these agreements. In addition, in conn ection with the amendment and extension of our license agreement with Astellas, in August 2010, we received a $165.0 million up-front payment, which was deferred upon receipt and will be recognized as revenue ratably over a seven-year period beginning in mid-2011. As of December 31, 2010, $176.6 million of these technology licensing payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods. Net Product Sales In 2010 and 2009, we recognized as revenue $25.3 million and $18.4 million, respectively, of ARCALYST net product sales for which both the right of return no longer existed and rebates could be reasonably estimated. The Company had limited historical return experience for ARCALYST beginning with initial sales in 2008 through the end of 2009; therefore, ARCALYST net product sales were deferred until the right of return no longer existed and rebates could be reasonably estimated. Effe ctive in the first quarter of 2010, the Company determined that it had 46 accumulated sufficient historical data to reasonably estimate both product returns and rebates of ARCALYST . As a result, $4.8 million of previously deferred ARCALYST net product sales were recognized as revenue in the first quarter of 2010. The effect of this change in estimate related to ARCALYST net product sales revenue was to lower our net loss per share by $0.06 in 2010. At December 31, 2010, there was no deferred revenue related to ARCALYST net product sales. Contract Research and Other Revenue Contract research and other revenue in 2010 and 2009 included $4.6 million and $5.5 million, respectively, recognized in connection with our five-year grant from the NIH, which we were awarded in September 2006 as part of the NIH Knockout Mouse Project. Expenses Total operating expenses increased to $556.5 million in 2010 from $453.4 million in 2009. Our average headcount in 2010 increased to 1,249 from 980 in 2009 principally as a result of our expanding research and development activities, which were primarily attributable to our antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis. Operating expenses in 2010 and 2009 included a total of $39.9 million and $31.3 million, respectively, of non-cash compensation expense related to employee stock option and restricted stock awards (Non-cash Compensation Expense), as detailed below: For the year ended December 31, 2010 Expenses before inclusion of Non-cash Non-cash Compensation Compensation Expenses as Expenses Expense Expense Reported (In millions) Research and development $ 466.9 $ 22.3 $ 489.2 Selling, general, and administrative 47.6 17.6 65.2 Cost of goods sold 2.1 2.1 Total operating expenses $ 516.6 $ 39.9 $ 556.5 For the year ended December 31, 2009 Expenses before inclusion of Non-cash Non-cash Compensation Compensation Expenses as Expenses Expense Expense Reported (In millions) Research and development $ 380.0 $ 18.8 $ 398.8 Selling, general, and administrative 40.4 12.5 52.9 Cost of goods sold 1.7 1.7 Total operating expenses $ 422.1 $ 31.3 $ 453.4 The increase in total Non-cash Compensation Expense in 2010 was primarily attributable to (i) the recognition of higher expense in 2010 in connection with performance-based stock options that we estimate will vest, (ii) the increase in stock option awards in 2010, due in part to the increase in headcount, and (iii) the higher fair market value of our Common Stock on the date of our annual employee option grants made in December 2009 compared to December 2008. 47 Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased to $489.2 million in 2010 from $398.8 million in 2009. The following table summarizes the major categories of our research and development expenses in 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, Increase Research and Development Expenses 2010 2009 (Decrease) (In millions) Payroll and benefits (1) $ 131.7 $ 99.9 $ 31.8 Clinical trial expenses 106.9 111.6 (4.7 ) Clinical manufacturing costs (2) 95.6 66.7 28.9 Research and other development costs 53.8 42.3 11.5 Occupancy and other operating costs 52.3 40.6 11.7 Cost-sharing of Bayer HealthCare VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses (3) 48.9 37.7 11.2 Total research and development expenses $ 489.2 $ 398.8 $ 90.4 ____________________ (1) Includes $19.3 million and $16.2 million of Non-cash Compensation Expense in 2010 and 2009, respectively. (2) Represents the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in research, preclinical development, and clinical trials, including related payroll and benefits, Non-cash Compensation Expense, manufacturing materials and supplies, depreciation, and occupancy costs of our Rensselaer manufacturing facility. Includes $3.0 million and $2.6 million of Non-cash Compensation Expense in 2010 and 2009, respectively. (3) Under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, in periods when Bayer HealthCare incurs VEGF Trap- Eye development expenses, we also recognize, as additional research and development expense, the portion of Bayer HealthCare VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. Bayer HealthCare provides us with estimated VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter. Bayer HealthCare estimate is reconciled to its actual expenses for such quarter in the subsequent fiscal quarter and our portion of its VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse is adjusted accordingly. Payroll and benefits increased principally due to the increase in employee headcount, as described above. Clinical trial expenses decreased due primarily to lower costs related to our Phase 3 clinical development program for ARCALYST in gout, partly offset by higher costs related to our clinical development programs for VEGF Trap-Eye, principally in connection with our COPERNICUS trial in CRVO. Clinical manufacturing costs increased due to higher facility-related costs in connection with the expansion of our manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer facility and higher costs related to manufacturing clinical supplies of monoclonal antibodies, partly offset by lower costs related to manufacturing aflibercept clinical supplies. Research and other development costs increased primarily due to higher costs associated with our antibody programs. Occupa ncy and other operating costs increased principally in connection with our higher headcount, expanded research and development activities, and new and expanded leased laboratory and office facilities in Tarrytown, New York. Cost-sharing of Bayer HealthCare VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses increased primarily due to higher costs in connection with the VIEW 2 trial in wet AMD which is being conducted by Bayer HealthCare. 48 We prepare estimates of research and development costs for projects in clinical development, which include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor, Non-cash Compensation Expense, and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects, and, under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, the portion of Bayer HealthCare VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. Our estimates of research and development costs for clinical development programs are shown below: Year ended December 31, Increase Project Costs 2010 2009 (Decrease) (In millions) ARCALYST $ 56.8 $ 67.7 $ (10.9 ) VEGF Trap-Eye 138.5 109.8 28.7 Aflibercept 13.5 23.3 (9.8 ) REGN88 25.0 36.9 (11.9 ) REGN727 36.0 21.1 14.9 Other antibody candidates in clinical development 65.5 53.3 12.2 Other research programs & unallocated costs 153.9 86.7 67.2 Total research and development expenses $ 489.2 $ 398.8 $ 90.4 Drug development and approval in the United States is a multi-step process regulated by the FDA. The process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation, leading up to the submission of an IND to the FDA which, if successful, allows the opportunity for study in humans, or clinical study, of the potential new drug. Clinical development typically involves three phases of study: Phases 1, 2, and 3. The most significant costs in clinical development are in Phase 3 clinical trials, as they tend to be the longest and largest studies in the drug development process. Following successful completion of Phase 3 clinical trials for a biological product, a BLA must be submitted to, and accepted by, the FDA, and the FDA must approve the BLA prior to commercialization of the drug. It is not uncommon for the FDA to request additional data following its review of a BLA, which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses. We may elect either on our own, or at the request of the FDA, to conduct further studies that are referred to as Phase 3B and 4 studies. Phase 3B studies are initiated and either completed or substantially completed while the BLA is under FDA review. These studies are conducted under an IND. Phase 4 studies, also referred to as post-marketing studies, are studies that are initiated and conducted after the FDA has approved a product for marketing. In addition, as discovery research, preclinical development, and clinical programs progress, opportunities to expand development of drug candidates into new disease indications can emerge. We may elect to add such new disease indications to our development efforts (with the approval of our collaborator for joint development programs), thereby extending the period in which we will be developing a product. For example, we, and our collaborators where applicable, continue to explore furt her development of ARCALYST , aflibercept, and VEGF Trap-Eye in different disease indications. There are numerous uncertainties associated with drug development, including uncertainties related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development, uncertainties related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in the competitive landscape affecting a product candidate, and other risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A, Risk Factors under Risks Related to ARCALYST and the Development of Our Product Candidates, Regulatory and Litigation Risks, and Risks Related to Commercialization of Products. The lengthy process of seeking FDA approvals, and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. A ny failure by us to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business. For these reasons and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product and the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied, the estimated cost and scope of the projects, and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, accurate and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available. Similarly, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows. In 2008, we received FDA approval for ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS, a group of rare, inherited auto-inflammatory diseases that affect a very small group of people. We currently do not expect to generate material product revenues and net cash inflows from the sale of ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS. 49 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $65.2 million in 2010 from $52.9 million in 2009 due primarily to increases in compensation expense and recruitment costs, principally in connection with higher headcount in 2010, and an increase in Non-cash Compensation Expense for the reasons described above. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold in 2010 and 2009 was $2.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively, and consisted primarily of royalties and other period costs related to ARCALYST commercial supplies. To date, ARCALYST shipments to our customers have primarily consisted of supplies of inventory manufactured and expensed as research and development costs prior to FDA approval in 2008; therefore, the costs of these supplies were not included in costs of goods sold. Other Income and Expense Investment income decreased to $2.1 million in 2010 from $4.5 million in 2009, due primarily to lower yields on, and lower average balances of, cash and marketable securities. Interest expense increased to $9.1 million in 2010 from $2.3 million in 2009. Interest expense is primarily attributable to the imputed interest portion of payments to our landlord, commencing in the third quarter of 2009, to lease newly constructed laboratory and office facilities in Tarrytown, New York. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) In 2010, we did not recognize any income tax expense or benefit. In 2009, we recognized a $4.1 million income tax benefit, consisting primarily of (i) $2.7 million resulting from a provision in the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 that allowed us to claim a refund of U.S. federal alternative minimum tax that we paid in 2008, and (ii) $0.7 million resulting from a provision in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 that allowed us to claim a refund for a portion of our unused pre-2006 research tax credits. Years Ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 Net Loss Regeneron reported a net loss of $67.8 million, or $0.85 per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to a net loss of $79.1 million, or $1.00 per share (basic and diluted) for 2008. The decrease in our net loss in 2009 was principally due to higher collaboration revenue in connection with our antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis, receipt of a $20.0 million substantive performance milestone payment in connection with our VEGF Trap-Eye collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, and higher ARCALYST sales, partly offset by higher research and development expenses, as detailed below. Revenues Revenues in 2009 and 2008 consist of the following: (In millions) 2009 2008 Collaboration revenue Sanofi-aventis $ 247.2 $ 154.0 Bayer HealthCare 67.3 31.2 Total collaboration revenue 314.5 185.2 Technology licensing revenue 40.0 40.0 Net product sales 18.4 6.3 Contract research and other revenue 6.4 7.0 Total revenue $ 379.3 $ 238.5 50 Sanofi-aventis Collaboration Revenue The collaboration revenue we earned from sanofi-aventis, as detailed below, consisted primarily of reimbursement for research and development expenses and recognition of revenue related to non-refundable up-front payments of $105.0 million related to the aflibercept collaboration and $85.0 million related to the antibody collaboration. Years ended Sanofi-aventis Collaboration Revenue December 31, (In millions) 2009 2008 Aflibercept: Regeneron expense reimbursement $ 26.6 $ 35.6 Recognition of deferred revenue related to up-front payments 9.9 8.8 Total aflibercept 36.5 44.4 Antibody: Regeneron expense reimbursement 198.1 97.9 Recognition of deferred revenue related to up-front payment 9.9 10.5 Recognition of revenue related to VelociGene agreement 2.7 1.2 Total antibody 210.7 109.6 Total sanofi-aventis collaboration revenue $ 247.2 $ 154.0 Sanofi-aventis reimbursement of our aflibercept expenses decreased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to lower costs related to internal research activities and manufacturing aflibercept clinical supplies. Recognition of deferred revenue related to sanofi-aventis up-front aflibercept payments increased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to shortening the estimated performance period over which this deferred revenue is being recognized, effective in the fourth quarter of 2008. As of December 31, 2009, $42.5 million of the original $105.0 million of up-front payments related to aflibercept was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods. In 2009, sanofi-aventis reimbursement of our antibody expenses consisted of $99.8 million under the discovery agreement and $98.3 million of development costs under the license agreement, compared to $72.2 million and $25.7 million, respectively, in 2008. The higher reimbursement amounts in 2009 compared to 2008 were due to an increase in our research activities conducted under the discovery agreement and increases in our development activities for antibody candidates under the license agreement. Recognition of deferred revenue related to sanofi-aventis $85.0 million up-front payment decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to the November 2009 amendments to expand and extend the companies antibody collaboration. As of December 31, 2009, $63.7 million of the original $85.0 million up-front payment was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods. In August 2008, we entered into a separate VelociGene agreement with sanofi-aventis. In 2009 and 2008, we recognized $2.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively, in revenue related to this agreement. Bayer HealthCare Collaboration Revenue The collaboration revenue we earned from Bayer HealthCare, as detailed below, consisted of cost sharing of Regeneron VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses and recognition of revenue related to a non-refundable $75.0 million up-front payment received in October 2006 and a $20.0 million milestone payment received in August 2007 (which, for the purpose of revenue recognition, was not considered substantive). Years ended Bayer HealthCare Collaboration Revenue December 31, (In millions) 2009 2008 Cost-sharing of Regeneron VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses $ 37.4 $ 18.8 Substantive performance milestone payment 20.0 Recognition of deferred revenue related to up-front and other milestone payments 9.9 12.4 Total Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue $ 67.3 $ 31.2 51 Cost-sharing of our VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses with Bayer HealthCare increased in 2009 compared to 2008. Under the terms of the collaboration, in 2009, all agreed-upon VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses incurred by Regeneron and Bayer HealthCare under a global development plan were shared equally. In 2008, the first $70.0 million of agreed-upon VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses were shared equally, and we were solely responsible for up to the next $30.0 million. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we were solely responsible for most of the collaboration VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses, which reduced the amount of cost-sharing revenue we earned from Bayer HealthCare in 2008. In addition, cost-sharing revenue increased in 2009, compared to 2008, due to higher clinical development costs in connection with our VIEW 1 trial in wet AMD, Phase 2 DA VINCI trial in DME, and COPERNICUS trial in CRVO. In July 2009, we received a $20.0 million substantive performance milestone payment from Bayer HealthCare in connection with our COPERNICUS trial, which was recognized as collaboration revenue. Recognition of deferred revenue related to the up-front and August 2007 milestone payments from Bayer HealthCare decreased in 2009 from 2008 due to an extension of the estimated performance period over which this deferred revenue is being recognized, effective in the fourth quarter of 2008. As of December 31, 2009, $56.8 million of these up-front licensing and milestone payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods. Technology Licensing Revenue In connection with our VelocImmune license agreements with AstraZeneca and Astellas, each of the $20.0 million annual, non-refundable payments were deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue ratably over approximately the ensuing year of each agreement. In both 2009 and 2008, we recognized $40.0 million of technology licensing revenue related to these agreements. Net Product Sales In 2009 and 2008, we recognized as revenue $18.4 million and $6.3 million, respectively, of ARCALYST net product sales for which both the right of return no longer existed and rebates could be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2009, deferred revenue related to ARCALYST net product sales totaled $4.8 million. Contract Research and Other Revenue Contract research and other revenue in 2009 and 2008 included $5.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively, recognized in connection with our five-year grant from the NIH, which we were awarded in September 2006 as part of the NIH Knockout Mouse Project. Expenses Total operating expenses increased to $453.4 million in 2009 from $324.7 million in 2008. Our average headcount in 2009 increased to 980 from 810 in 2008 principally as a result of our expanding research and development activities, which were primarily attributable to our antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis. Operating expenses in 2009 and 2008 included a total of $31.3 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of Non-cash Compensation Expense, as detailed below: For the year ended December 31, 2009 Expenses before inclusion of Non-cash Non-cash Expenses Compensation Compensation Expenses as (In millions) Expense Expense Reported Research and development $ 380.0 $ 18.8 $ 398.8 Selling, general, and administrative 40.4 12.5 52.9 Cost of goods sold 1.7 1.7 Total operating expenses $ 422.1 $ 31.3 453.4 52 For the year ended December 31, 2008 Expenses before inclusion of Non-cash Non-cash Expenses Compensation Compensation Expenses as (In millions) Expense Expense Reported Research and development $ 255.9 $ 19.0 $ 274.9 Selling, general, and administrative 35.4 13.5 48.9 Cost of goods sold 0.9 0.9 Total operating expenses $ 292.2 $ 32.5 $ 324.7 The decrease in total Non-cash Compensation Expense in 2009 was primarily attributable to the lower fair market value of our Common Stock on the date of our annual employee option grants made in December 2008 as compared to the fair market value of annual employee option grants made in recent years prior to 2008. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased to $398.8 million in 2009 from $274.9 million in 2008. The following table summarizes the major categories of our research and development expenses in 2009 and 2008: Year Ended Research and Development Expenses December 31, (In millions) 2009 2008 Increase Payroll and benefits (1) $ 99.9 $ 81.7 $ 18.2 Clinical trial expenses 111.6 49.3 62.3 Clinical manufacturing costs (2) 66.7 53.8 12.9 Research and other development costs 42.3 29.6 12.7 Occupancy and other operating costs 40.6 30.5 10.1 Cost-sharing of Bayer HealthCare VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses (3) 37.7 30.0 7.7 Total research and development $ 398.8 $ 274.9 $ 123.9 ____________________ (1) Includes $16.2 million and $16.7 million of Non-cash Compensation Expense in 2009 and 2008, respectively. (2) Represents the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in research, preclinical development, and clinical trials, including related payroll and benefits, Non-cash Compensation Expense, manufacturing materials and supplies, depreciation, and occupancy costs of our Rensselaer manufacturing facility. Includes $2.6 million and $2.3 million of Non-cash Compensation Expense in 2009 and 2008, respectively. (3) Under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, in periods when Bayer HealthCare incurs VEGF Trap- Eye development expenses, we also recognize, as additional research and development expense, the portion of Bayer HealthCare VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. Bayer HealthCare provides us with estimated VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter. Bayer HealthCare estimate is reconciled to its actual expenses for such quarter in the subsequent fiscal quarter and our portion of its VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse is adjusted accordingly. Payroll and benefits increased principally due to the increase in employee headcount, as described above. Clinical trial expenses increased due primarily to higher costs related to our clinical development programs for (i) VEGF Trap-Eye, including our VIEW 1 trial in wet AMD, DA VINCI trial in DME, and COPERNICUS trial in CRVO, (ii) ARCALYST , related to our Phase 3 clinical development program in gout, and (iii) monoclonal antibody candidates, which are in earlier stage clinical development. Clinical manufacturing costs increased due to higher costs related to manufacturing clinical supplies of ARCALYST and monoclonal antibodies, partly offset by lower costs related to manufacturing aflibercept clinical supplies. Researc h and other development costs increased primarily due to higher costs associated with our antibody programs. Occupancy and other operating costs increased principally in connection with our higher headcount, expanded research and development activities, and new and expanded leased laboratory and office facilities in Tarrytown, New York. Cost-sharing of Bayer HealthCare VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses increased primarily due to higher costs in connection with the VIEW 2 trial in wet AMD and the GALILEO trial in CRVO, both of which are being conducted by Bayer HealthCare. 53 We prepare estimates of research and development costs for projects in clinical development, which include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor, Non-cash Compensation Expense, and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects, and, under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, the portion of Bayer HealthCare VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. Our estimates of research and development costs for clinical development programs are shown below: Year ended Project Costs December 31, Increase (In millions) 2009 2008 (Decrease) ARCALYST $ 67.7 $ 39.2 $ 28.5 VEGF Trap-Eye 109.8 82.7 27.1 Aflibercept 23.3 32.1 (8.8 ) REGN88 36.9 21.4 15.5 Other antibody candidates in clinical development 74.4 27.4 47.0 Other research programs & unallocated costs 86.7 72.1 14.6 Total research and development expenses $ 398.8 $ 274.9 $ 123.9 For the reasons described above in Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, under the caption Research and Development Expenses , and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product and the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied, the estimated cost and scope of the projects, and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, accurate and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available. Similarly, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows. In 2008, we received FDA approval for ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS, a group of rare, inherited auto-inflammatory diseases that affect a very small group of people. We currently do not expect to generate material product revenues and net cash inflows from the sale of ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $52.9 million in 2009 from $48.9 million in 2008. In 2009, we incurred (i) higher compensation expense, (ii) higher patent-related costs, (iii) higher facility-related costs due primarily to increases in administrative headcount, and (iv) higher patient assistance costs related to ARCALYST . These increases were partly offset by (i) lower marketing costs related to ARCALYST , (ii) a decrease in administrative recruitment costs, and (iii) lower professional fees related to various corporate matters. Cost of Goods Sold During 2008, we began recognizing revenue and cost of goods sold from net product sales of ARCALYST . Cost of goods sold in 2009 and 2008 was $1.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively, and consisted primarily of royalties and other period costs related to ARCALYST commercial supplies. In 2009 and 2008, ARCALYST shipments to our customers consisted of supplies of inventory manufactured and expensed as research and development costs prior to FDA approval in 2008; therefore, the costs of these supplies were not included in costs of goods sold. Other Income and Expense Investment income decreased to $4.5 million in 2009 from $18.2 million in 2008, due primarily to lower yields on, and lower balances of, cash and marketable securities. In addition, in 2009 and 2008, deterioration in the credit quality of specific marketable securities in our investment portfolio subjected us to the risk of not being able to recover these securities carrying values. As a result, in 2009 and 2008, we recognized charges of $0.1 million and $2.5 million, respectively, related to these securities, which we considered to be other than temporarily impaired. In 2009 and 2008, these charges were either wholly or partly offset by realized gains of $0.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively, on sales of marketable securities during the year. 54 Interest expense decreased to $2.3 million in 2009 from $7.8 million in 2008. Interest expense in 2009 was attributable to the imputed interest portion of payments to our landlord, commencing in the third quarter of 2009, to lease newly constructed laboratory and office facilities in Tarrytown, New York. Interest expense in 2008 related to $200.0 million of 5.5% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes until they were retired. During the second and third quarters of 2008, we repurchased a total of $82.5 million in principal amount of these convertible notes for $83.3 million. In connection with these repurchases, we recognized a $0.9 million loss on early extinguishment of debt, representing the premium paid on the notes plus related unamortized debt issuance costs. The remaining $117.5 million of convertible notes were repaid in full upon their maturity in October 2008. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) In 2009, we recognized a $4.1 million income tax benefit, consisting primarily of (i) $2.7 million resulting from a provision in the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 that allowed us to claim a refund of U.S. federal alternative minimum tax that we paid in 2008, as described below, and (ii) $0.7 million resulting from a provision in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 that allowed us to claim a refund for a portion of our unused pre-2006 research tax credits. In 2008, we implemented a tax planning strategy which resulted in the utilization of certain net operating loss carry-forwards that would otherwise have expired over the next several years, to offset income for tax purposes. As a result, we incurred and paid income tax expense of $3.1 million, which relates to U.S. federal and New York State alternative minimum taxes and included $0.2 million of interest and penalties. This expense was partly offset by a $0.7 million income tax benefit, resulting from a provision in the Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008 that allowed us to claim a refund for a portion of our unused pre-2006 research tax credits. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since our inception in 1988, we have financed our operations primarily through offerings of our equity securities, a private placement of convertible debt (which was repaid in 2008), purchases of our equity securities by our collaborators, including sanofi-aventis, revenue earned under our past and present research and development agreements, including our agreements with sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare, our past contract manufacturing agreements, and our technology licensing agreements, ARCALYST product revenue, and investment income. Sources and Uses of Cash for the Years Ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 At December 31, 2010, we had $626.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (including $7.5 million of restricted cash and marketable securities) compared with $390.0 million at December 31, 2009 (including $1.6 million of restricted cash) and $527.5 million (including $1.7 million of restricted cash) at December 31, 2008. In October 2010, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 6,325,000 shares of Common Stock and received net proceeds of $174.8 million. Under the terms of our non-exclusive license agreements with AstraZeneca and Astellas, each company made $20.0 million annual, non-refundable payments to us in each of 2010, 2009, and 2008. In addition, in connection with the July 2010 amendment and extension of our license agreement with Astellas, we received a $165.0 million up-front payment from Astellas in Augus t 2010. We also received, from Bayer HealthCare, a $10.0 million milestone payment in December 2010 in connection with the VIEW 1 study, and a $20.0 million milestone payment in July 2009 in connection with the COPERNICUS study. Cash Provided by (Used in) Operations Net cash provided by operations was $96.3 million in 2010, compared with net cash used in operations of $72.2 million in 2009 and $89.1 million in 2008. Our net losses of $104.5 million in 2010, $67.8 million in 2009, and $79.1 million in 2008 included $39.9 million, $31.3 million, and $32.5 million, respectively, of Non-cash Compensation Expense. Our net losses also included depreciation and amortization of $19.7 million, $14.2 million, and $11.3 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010, accounts receivable increased by $27.5 million, compared to end-of-year 2009, primarily due to a higher receivable balance related to our antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis and a $10.0 million milestone payment receivable from Bayer HealthCare, which was earned in December 2010 in connection with the COPERNICUS study. Our deferred revenue at December 31, 2010 increased by $158.2 million, compared to 55 end-of-year 2009, primarily due to (i) the receipt of the $165.0 million up-front payment from Astellas, as described above, which was deferred and will be recognized ratably over the seven-year period commencing in mid-2011 and (ii) sanofi-aventis funding of $22.9 million of agreed-upon costs incurred by us during 2010 to expand our manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer facilities, which was deferred and is being recognized as collaboration revenue prospectively over the related performance period in conjunction with the original $85.0 million up-front payment received from sanofi-aventis. These increases were partly offset by amortization of previously received deferred payments under our sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare collaborations. Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities increased $7.6 million at December 31, 2010, compared to end-of-year 2009, primarily in connection with our expanded levels of act ivities and expenditures, including higher liabilities for payroll-related expenses. At December 31, 2009, accounts receivable increased by $30.4 million, compared to end-of-year 2008, primarily due to a higher receivable balance related to our antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis. Our deferred revenue at December 31, 2009 decreased by $27.5 million, compared to end-of-year 2008, primarily due to the amortization of previously received deferred payments under our collaborations with sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare. Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities increased $12.6 million at December 31, 2009, compared to end-of-year 2008, primarily in connection with our expanded levels of activities and expenditures, including higher liabilities for clinical-related expenses, which were partly offset by an $8.6 million decrease in the cost-sharing payment due to Bayer HealthCare in connection with our VEGF Trap-Eye collaboration. At December 31, 2008, accounts receivable increased by $16.9 million, compared to end-of-year 2007, primarily due to a higher receivable balance related to our antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis. Our deferred revenue at December 31, 2008 decreased by $26.8 million, compared to end-of-year 2007, primarily due to the amortization of previously received deferred payments under our collaborations with sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare. This decrease was partly offset by the deferral of $4.0 million of ARCALYST net product sales at December 31, 2008. The majority of our cash expenditures in 2010, 2009, and 2008 were to fund research and development, primarily related to our clinical programs and our preclinical human monoclonal antibody programs. In 2008, we made interest payments totaling $9.3 million on our convertible senior subordinated notes. The convertible notes were repaid in full in October 2008. Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $434.2 million in 2010, compared with net cash provided by investing activities of $146,000 in 2009 and $30.8 million in 2008. In 2010, purchases of marketable securities exceeded sales or maturities by $335.6 million. In 2009 and 2008, sales or maturities of marketable securities exceeded purchases by $97.4 million and $65.7 million, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2010, 2009, and 2008 included costs in connection with expanding our manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer, New York facilities and tenant improvements and related costs in connection with our December 2006 Tarrytown, New York lease, as described below. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $243.3 million in 2010 and $31.4 million in 2009, respectively, and net cash used in financing activities was $192.9 million in 2008. In October 2010, we completed an underwritten public offering of 6,325,000 shares of our Common Stock and received net proceeds of $174.8 million. In addition, proceeds from issuances of our Common Stock in connection with exercises of stock options were $22.0 million in 2010, $8.6 million in 2009, and $7.9 million in 2008. In 2010 and 2009, we received $47.5 million and $23.6 million, respectively, of tenant improvement reimbursements from our landlord in connection with our new Tarrytown facilities, which we are deemed to own in accordance with FASB authoritative guidance. In the second and third quarters of 2008, we repurchased $82.5 million in principal amount of our conver tible senior subordinated notes for $83.3 million. The remaining $117.5 million of convertible notes were repaid in full upon their maturity in October 2008. 56 Fair Value of Marketable Securities At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we held marketable securities whose aggregate fair value totaled $513.9 million and $181.3 million, respectively. The composition of our portfolio of marketable securities on these dates was as follows: 2010 2009 Investment type Fair Value Percent Fair Value Percent Unrestricted U.S. government agency securities $ 434.4 85 % $ 29.6 16 % U.S. Treasury securities 80.4 44 % U.S. government-guaranteed corporate bonds 64.0 13 % 48.7 27 % Equity securities 3.6 1 % 5.4 3 % U.S. government guaranteed collateralized mortgage obligations 2.1 3.7 2 % Corporate bonds 10.3 6 % Other 1.6 Mortgage-backed securities 1.1 3.2 2 % Total unrestricted marketable securities 506.8 99 % 181.3 100 % Restricted U.S. government agency securities 7.1 1 % Total marketable securities $ 513.9 100 % $ 181.3 100 % In addition, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $113.0 million and $208.7 million, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, primarily held in money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities. We classify our investments using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The three tiers are Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. The Company held one Level 3 marketable security, which had no fair value at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and whose fair value was $0.1 million at December 31, 2008. This Level 3 security was valued using information provided by the Company investment advisors and other sources, including quoted bid prices which took into consideration the securities lack of liquidity. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded charges for other-than-temporary impairment of this Level 3 marketable security totaling $0.1 million; therefore, as of December 31, 2009, the fair value of this security had been written down to zero. There were no purchases, sales, or maturities of Level 3 marketable securities and no unrealized gains or losses related to Level 3 marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. There were no transfers of marketable securities between Levels 1, 2, or 3 classifications during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Our methods for valuing our marketable securities are described in Note 2 to our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. With respect to valuations for pricing our Level 2 marketable securities, we consider quantitative and qualitative factors such as financial conditions and near term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market, or industry trends. For valuations that we determine for our Level 3 marketable securities, we regularly monitor these securities and adjust their valuations as deemed appropriate based on the facts and circumstances. Collaborations with sanofi-aventis Aflibercept In September 2003, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (predecessor to sanofi-aventis U.S.) to collaborate on the development and commercialization of aflibercept in all countries other than Japan, where we retained the exclusive right to develop and commercialize aflibercept. Sanofi-aventis made a non-refundable up-front payment of $80.0 million and purchased 2,799,552 newly issued unregistered shares of our Common Stock for $45.0 million. 57 In January 2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended the collaboration agreement to exclude, from the scope of the collaboration, the development and commercialization of aflibercept for intraocular delivery to the eye. In connection with this amendment, sanofi-aventis made a $25.0 million non-refundable payment to us. In December 2005, we and sanofi-aventis amended our collaboration agreement to expand the territory in which the companies are collaborating on the development of aflibercept to include Japan. In connection with this amendment, sanofi-aventis agreed to make a $25.0 million non-refundable up-front payment to us, which was received in January 2006. Under the collaboration agreement, as amended, we and sanofi-aventis will share co-promotion rights and profits on sales, if any, of aflibercept outside of Japan for disease indications included in our collaboration. In Japan, we are entitled to a royalty of approximately 35% on annual sales of aflibercept. We may also receive up to $400 million in milestone payments upon receipt of specified marketing approvals, including up to $360 million in milestone payments related to the receipt of marketing approvals for up to eight aflibercept oncology and other indications in the United States or the European Union and up to $40 million related to the receipt of marketing approvals for up to five aflibercept oncology indications in Japan. We have agreed to manufacture clinical supplies of aflibercept at our plant in Rensselaer, New York. Sanofi-aventis has agreed to be responsible for providing commercial scale manufacturing capacity for aflibercept. Under the collaboration agreement, as amended, agreed upon worldwide aflibercept development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement, including costs associated with the manufacture of clinical drug supply, will be funded by sanofi-aventis. If the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of these development expenses, including 50% of the $25.0 million payment received in connection with the January 2005 amendment to our collaboration agreement, in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses and our share of the collaboration profits and Japan royalties, or at a faster rate at our option. In addition, if the first commercial sale of an aflibercept product for intraocular delivery to the eye predates the first commercial sale of an aflibercept product under the collaboration by two years, we will begin reimbursing sanofi-aventis for up to $7.5 million of aflibercept development expenses in accordance with a formula until the first commercial aflibercept sale under the collaboration occurs. Since inception of the collaboration agreement through December 31, 2010, we and sanofi-aventis have incurred $707.3 million in agreed upon development expenses related to aflibercept. Currently, multiple clinical studies to evaluate aflibercept as both a single agent and in combination with other therapies in various cancer indications are ongoing. Sanofi-aventis funded $16.5 million, $26.6 million, and $35.6 million, respectively, of our aflibercept development costs in 2010, 2009, and 2008, of which $3.9 million, $3.6 million, and $6.3 million, respectively, were included in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. In addition, the up-front payments from sanofi-aventis of $80.0 million in September 2003 and $25.0 million in January 2006 were recorded to deferred revenue and are being recognized as contract research and development revenue over the period during which we expect to perform services. In 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recognized $9.9 million, $9.9 million, and $8.8 million of revenue, respectively, related to these up-front payments. Sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least twelve months advance notice. Upon termination of the agreement for any reason, any remaining obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of aflibercept development expenses will terminate and we will retain all rights to aflibercept. Antibodies In November 2007, we and sanofi-aventis entered into a global, strategic collaboration to discover, develop, and commercialize fully human monoclonal antibodies. The collaboration is governed by a Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement and a License and Collaboration Agreement. In connection with the execution of the discovery agreement in 2007, we received a non-refundable up-front payment of $85.0 million from sanofi-aventis. Pursuant to the collaboration, sanofi-aventis is funding our research to identify and validate potential drug discovery targets and develop fully human monoclonal antibodies against these targets. Sanofi-aventis funded approximately $175 million of research from the collaboration inception through December 31, 2009. In November 2009, we and sanofi-aventis amended these collaboration agreements to expand and extend our antibody collaboration. Under the amended discovery agreement, sanofi-aventis agreed to fund up to $160 million per year of our antibody discovery activities in 2010 through 2017, subject to a one-time option for sanofi-aventis to adjust the maximum reimbursement amount down to $120 million per year commencing in 2014 if over the prior two years certain specified criteria 58 were not satisfied. In 2010, as we scaled up our capacity to conduct antibody discovery activities, sanofi-aventis funded $137.7 million of our preclinical research under the amended discovery agreement. The balance between that amount and $160 million, or $22.3 million, has been added to the funding otherwise available to us in 2011-2012 under the amended discovery agreement. The amended discovery agreement will expire on December 31, 2017; however, sanofi-aventis has an option to extend the agreement for up to an additional three years for further antibody development and preclinical activities. For each drug candidate identified through discovery research under the discovery agreement, sanofi-aventis has the option to license rights to the candidate under the license agreement. If it elects to do so, sanofi-aventis will co-develop the drug candidate with us through product approval. Under the license agreement, agreed upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement are funded by sanofi-aventis, except that following receipt of the first positive Phase 3 trial results for a co-developed drug candidate, subsequent Phase 3 trial-related costs for that drug candidate (called Shared Phase 3 Trial Costs) are shared 80% by sanofi-aventis and 20% by us. If the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi-aventis for 50% of development expenses that were fully funded by sanofi-aventis (or half of $341.0 million as of December 31, 2010 ) and 30% of Shared Phase 3 Trial Costs, in accordance with a defined formula based on the amounts of these expenses and our share of the collaboration profits from commercialization of collaboration products. However, we are not required to apply more than 10% of our share of the profits from collaboration products in any calendar quarter towards reimbursing sanofi-aventis for these development costs. If sanofi-aventis does not exercise its option to license rights to a particular drug candidate under the license agreement, we retain the exclusive right to develop and commercialize such drug candidate, and sanofi-aventis will receive a royalty on sales, if any. Sanofi-aventis will lead commercialization activities for products developed under the license agreement, subject to our right to co-promote such products. The parties will equally share profits and losses from sales within the United States. The parties will share profits outside the United States on a sliding scale based on sales starting at 65% (sanofi-aventis)/35% (us) and ending at 55% (sanofi-aventis)/45% (us), and losses outside the United States at 55% (sanofi-aventis)/45% (us). In addition to profit sharing, we are entitled to receive up to $250 million in sales milestone payments, with milestone payments commencing only if and after aggregate annual sales outside the United States exceed $1.0 billion on a rolling 12-month basis. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply clinical requirements of each drug candidate under the collaboration until commercial supplies of that drug candidate are being manufactured. In connection with the November 2009 amendment of the collaboration discovery agreement, sanofi-aventis is funding up to $30 million of agreed-upon costs incurred by us to expand our manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer, New York facilities, of which $21.6 million had been received, and $1.8 million was included in accounts receivable, at December 31, 2010. In 2010, 2009, and 2008, sanofi-aventis funded $137.7 million, $99.8 million, and $72.2 million, respectively, of our expenses under the collaboration discovery agreement and $138.3 million, $98.3 million, and $25.7 million, respectively, of our development costs under the license agreement. Of these amounts, $73.4 million, $57.9 million and $25.5 million were included in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The $85.0 million up-front payment received from sanofi-aventis in December 2007 was recorded to deferred revenue and is being recognized as collaboration revenue over the period during which we expect to perform services. In addition, reimbursements by sanofi-aventis of our costs to expand our manufacturing capacity are recorded to deferred revenue and recognized prospectively as collaboration revenue ov er the same period applicable to recognition of the $85.0 million up-front payment. In 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recognized $7.3 million, $9.9 million, and $10.5 million of revenue, respectively, related to these deferred payments. In connection with the antibody collaboration, in August 2008, we entered into a separate agreement with sanofi-aventis to use our proprietary VelociGene technology platform to supply sanofi-aventis with genetically modified mammalian models of gene function and disease. The agreement provides for minimum annual order quantities for the term of the agreement, which extends through December 2012, for which we expect to receive payments totaling a minimum of $21.5 million, of which $9.2 million had been received as of December 31, 2010. With respect to each antibody product which enters development under the license agreement, sanofi-aventis or we may, by giving twelve months notice, opt-out of further development and/or commercialization of the product, in which event the other party retains exclusive rights to continue the development and/or commercialization of the product. We may also opt-out of the further development of an antibody product if we give notice to sanofi- 59 aventis within thirty days of the date that sanofi-aventis elects to jointly develop such antibody product under the license agreement. Each of the discovery agreement and the license agreement contains other termination provisions, including for material breach by the other party. Prior to December 31, 2017, sanofi-aventis has the right to terminate the amended discovery agreement without cause with at least three months advance written notice; however, except under defined circumstances, sanofi-aventis would be obligated to immediately pay to us the full amount of unpaid research funding during the remaining term of the research agreement through December 31, 2017. Upon termination of the collaboration in its entirety, our obligation to reimburse sanofi-aventis for development costs out of any future profits from collaboration products will terminate. In December 2007, we sold sanofi-aventis 12 million newly issued, unregistered shares of Common Stock at an aggregate cash price of $312.0 million, or $26.00 per share of Common Stock. As a condition to the closing of this transaction, sanofi-aventis entered into an investor agreement with us. This agreement, which was amended in November 2009, contains certain demand rights, stand-still provisions , and other restrictions, which are more fully described in Note 12 to our Financial Statements. In addition, in October 2010, sanofi-aventis purchased 1,017,401 shares of Common Stock in our underwritten public offering. Collaboration with Bayer HealthCare In October 2006, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Bayer HealthCare to globally develop, and commercialize outside the United States, VEGF Trap-Eye. Under the terms of the agreement, Bayer HealthCare made a non-refundable up-front payment to us of $75.0 million. In August 2007, we received a $20.0 million milestone payment (which, for the purpose of revenue recognition, was not considered substantive) from Bayer HealthCare following dosing of the first patient in the VIEW 1 study of VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD. In July 2009, we received a $20.0 million substantive performance milestone payment from Bayer HealthCare following dosing of the first patient in the COPERNICUS study of VEGF Trap-Eye in CRVO. In both December 2010 and January 2011, we received a $10.0 million substantive milestone payment (for a total of $20.0 million) from Bayer HealthCare for achieving positive 52-week results in the VIEW 1 study and positive 6-month results in the COPERNICUS study, respectively. We are eligible to receive up to $50 million in future milestone payments related to marketing approvals of the VEGF Trap-Eye in major market countries outside the United States. We are also eligible to receive up to $135 million in sales milestone payments if total annual sales of VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United States achieve certain specified levels starting at $200 million. We will share equally with Bayer HealthCare in any future profits arising from the commercialization of VEGF Trap-Eye outside the United States. If VEGF Trap-Eye is granted marketing authorization in a major market country outside the United States and the collaboration becomes profitable, we will be obligated to reimburse Bayer HealthCare out of our share of the collaboration profits for 50% of the agreed upon development expenses that Bayer HealthCare has incurred (or half of $241.2 million at December 31, 2010) in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses that Bayer HealthCare has incurred and our share of the collaboration profits, or at a faster rate at our option. Within the United States, we are responsible for any future commercialization of VEGF Trap-Eye and retain exclusive rights to any future profits from such comm ercialization in the United States. To date, we and Bayer HealthCare have initiated Phase 3 programs of VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD, CRVO, and CNV of the retina as a result of pathologic myopia, and a Phase 2 clinical study in DME. We are also obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply clinical and commercial product requirements. The $75.0 million up-front payment and the $20.0 million milestone payment received in August 2007 from Bayer HealthCare were recorded to deferred revenue. In 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recognized $9.9 million, $9.9 million, and $12.4 million, respectively, of revenue related to these payments. The $10.0 million substantive milestone payments received from Bayer HealthCare in each of December 2010 and January 2011 were recognized as collaboration revenue in 2010, and the $20.0 million substantive performance milestone payment received from Bayer HealthCare in July 2009 was recognized as collaboration revenue in 2009. Under the terms of the agreement, in 2009 and thereafter, all agreed upon VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses incurred by both companies under a global development plan will be shared equally. In 2010 and 2009, this resulted in net payments by us of $2.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively, to Bayer HealthCare. In 2008, the first $70.0 million of VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses were shared equally and we were solely responsible for up to the next $30.0 million, which resulted in a net payment by us of $11.3 million to Bayer HealthCare. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, accrued expenses included $2.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, due to Bayer HealthCare. 60 Bayer HealthCare has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least six months or twelve months advance notice depending on defined circumstances at the time of termination. In the event of termination of the agreement for any reason, we retain all rights to VEGF Trap-Eye. License Agreement with AstraZeneca Under this non-exclusive license agreement, AstraZeneca made a $20.0 million annual, non-refundable payment to us in each of 2010, 2009, 2008, and 2007. In November 2010, as permitted by the agreement, MedImmune Limited (as successor by novation from AstraZeneca) gave written notice of voluntary termination of the agreement, effective in February 2011. We remain entitled to receive mid-single digit royalties on any future sales of antibody products discovered by MedImmune using our VelocImmune technology. License Agreement with Astellas Under this non-exclusive license agreement, Astellas made a $20.0 million annual, non-refundable payment to us in each of 2010, 2009, 2008, and 2007. In July 2010, the license agreement with Astellas was amended and extended through June 2023. Under the terms of the amended agreement, Astellas made a $165.0 million up-front payment to us in August 2010. In addition, Astellas will make a $130.0 million second payment to us in June 2018 unless the license agreement has been terminated prior to that date. Astellas has the right to terminate the agreement at any time by providing 90 days advance written notice. Under certain limited circumstances, such as our material breach of the agreement, Astellas may terminate the agreement and receive a refund of a portion of its up-front payment or, if such termination occurs after June 2018, a portion of its econd payment, to us under the July 2010 amendment to the agreement. We are entitled to receive a mid-single-digit royalty on any future sales of antibody products discovered by Astellas using our VelocImmune technology. National Institutes of Health Grant Under our five-year grant from the NIH, as amended, we are entitled to receive a minimum of $25.3 million over the five-year period beginning in September 2006, subject to compliance with the grant terms and annual funding approvals, including $1.5 million to optimize our existing C57BL/6 ES cell line and its proprietary growth medium. In 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recognized $4.6 million, $5.5 million, and $4.9 million, respectively, of revenue related to the NIH Grant, of which $1.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively, was receivable at the end of 2010 and 2009. Under the NIH grant, as amended, we have received $21.6 million from the grant inception through December 31, 2010. In 2011, we expect to receive funding of approximately $3.7 million for reimbursement of our expenses related to the NIH Grant. License Agreement with Cellectis In July 2008, we and Cellectis S.A. entered into an Amended and Restated Non-Exclusive License Agreement. The amended license agreement resolved a dispute between the parties related to the interpretation of a license agreement entered into by the parties in December 2003 pursuant to which we licensed certain patents and patent applications relating to a process for the specific replacement of a copy of a gene in the receiver genome by homologous recombination. Pursuant to the amended license agreement, in July 2008, we made a non-refundable $12.5 million payment to Cellectis and agreed to pay Cellectis a low single-digit royalty based on revenue received by us from any future licenses or sales of our VelociGene or VelocImmune products and services. No royalties are payable to Cellectis with respect to our VelocImmune license agreements with AstraZeneca and Astellas or our antibody collaboration with sanofi-aventis. In addition, no royalties are payable to Cellectis on any revenue from commercial sales of antibodies from our VelocImmune technology . We are amortizing our $12.5 million payment to Cellectis in proportion to past and anticipated future revenues under our license agreements with AstraZeneca and Astellas and our antibody discovery agreement with sanofi-aventis (as amended in November 2009). In 2010, 2009, and 2008 we recognized $0.9 million, $2.3 million, and $2.7 million, respectively, of expense related to the Cellectis agreement. 61 Lease Tarrytown, New York Facilities: We lease approximately 545,600 square feet of laboratory and office space at facilities in Tarrytown, New York, under a December 2006 lease agreement, as amended. These facilities include approximately 230,000 square feet of newly constructed space in two new buildings (Buildings A and B) that were completed during the third quarter of 2009 and, under a December 2009 amendment to the lease, approximately 131,000 square feet of additional new space in a third new building (Building C), which we expect to occupy in early 2011. The lease will expire in June 2024 and contains three renewal options to extend the term of the lease by five years each, as well as early termination options on approximately 316,000 square feet of space. The lease provides for monthly payments over its term and additional charges for utilities, taxes, and operating expenses. Certain premises under the lease are accounted for as operat ing leases. However, for Buildings A, B, and C that we are leasing, we are deemed, in substance, to be the owner of the landlord buildings in accordance with the application of FASB authoritative guidance, and the landlord costs of constructing these new facilities are required to be capitalized on our books as a non-cash transaction, offset by a corresponding lease obligation on our balance sheet. In connection with the lease, we issued a letter of credit to our landlord, currently in the amount of $3.4 million, which is fully collateralized by cash and marketable securities. In connection with Buildings A and B, we capitalized our landlord costs of constructing these new facilities, which totaled $58.4 million as of December 31, 2010, and recognized a corresponding facility lease obligation of $58.4 million. We also recognized, as an additional facility lease obligation, reimbursements totaling $56.9 million from our landlord during 2010 and 2009 for tenant improvement costs that we incurred since, under FASB authoritative guidance, these reimbursements from our landlord are deemed to be a financing obligation. Monthly lease payments on these facilities are allocated between the land element of the lease (which is accounted for as an operating lease) and the facility lease obligation, based on the estimated relative fair values of the land and buildings. The imputed interest rate applicable to the facility lease obli gation is approximately 11%. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the facility lease obligation balance in connection with Buildings A and B was $113.7 million and $81.0 million, respectively. In addition, as described above, we amended our lease in December 2009 to include additional new laboratory and office space in Building C. As of December 31, 2010, we capitalized $27.8 million of our landlord costs of constructing Building C and recognized a corresponding facility lease obligation of $27.8 million. We also recognized, as an additional facility lease obligation, reimbursements totaling $14.2 million from our landlord during 2010 for tenant improvement costs that we will incur since, under FASB authoritative guidance, these reimbursements from our landlord are deemed to be a financing obligation. Monthly lease payments on the Building C facilities commenced in January 2011 and additional charges for utilities, taxes, and operating expenses commenced in January 2010. Rent expense in connection with the land element of these additio nal facilities, which is accounted for as an operating lease, commenced in December 2010 and were recorded as a deferred liability until lease payments commence in January 2011. In addition, interest expense is imputed at a rate of approximately 9%, and is capitalized and deferred in connection with this facility lease obligation. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the facility lease obligation balance in connection with Building C was $46.4 million and $28.0 million, respectively. Capital Expenditures Our cash expenditures for property, plant, and equipment totaled $99.7 million in 2010, $97.3 million in 2009, and $34.9 million in 2008. In February 2010, we received $47.5 million from our landlord in connection with tenant improvement costs in Tarrytown. In addition, as described above, sanofi-aventis has funded $22.9 million of agreed-upon capital expenditures incurred by us during 2010 to expand our manufacturing capacity at our Rensselaer facilities, which was either received or receivable at December 31, 2010. We expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $50 to $75 million in 2011, primarily in connection with tenant improvements at our leased Tarrytown facilities, capital improvements at our Rensselaer, New York manufacturing facilities, and purchases of equipment. We expect to be reimbursed for a portion of these capital expenditures for our Rensselaer facilities by sanofi-aventis, with the remaining amount to be funded by our existing capital resources. 62 Funding Requirements Our total expenses for research and development from inception through December 31, 2010 were approximately $2.5 billion. We have entered into various agreements related to our activities to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms, including collaboration agreements such as those with sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare, and agreements to use our Velocigene technology platform. We incurred expenses associated with these agreements, which include reimbursable and non-reimbursable amounts, an allocable portion of general and administrative costs, and cost sharing of collaborator development expenses, where applicable, of $431.4 million, $333.7 million, and $230.6 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. We expect to continue to incur substantial funding requirements for research and development activities (including preclinical and clinical testing). As described above, expenses that we incur in connection with our aflibercept and antibodies collaborations are, generally, fully funded by sanofi-aventis. In addition, as described above, we and Bayer HealthCare share agreed-upon development expenses that both companies incur in connection with our VEGF Trap-Eye collaboration. After taking into account anticipated reimbursements from our collaborators, we currently estimate that approximately 30-40% of our funding requirements for 2011 will be directed toward technology development, basic research and early preclinical activities, and the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates (principally, for ARCALYST and VEGF Trap-Eye). For 2011, we also currently estimate that approximately 20-30% of our funding requirements will be directed toward preparing for the potential commercialization of our late-stage product candidates; approximately 15-25% of our funding requirements will be applied to capital expenditures (as described above); and the remainder of our funding requirements will be used for general corporate purposes. In connection with our funding requirements, the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010. These obligations and commitments assume non-termination of agreements and represent expected payments based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to change: Payments Due by Period Less than Greater than Total one year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years 5 years (In millions) Operating leases (1) $ 96.3 $ 6.3 $ 12.2 $ 13.6 $ 64.2 Capital leases 3.2 1.1 2.1 Purchase obligations (2) 108.6 99.2 9.4 Other long-term liabilities (3) 250.0 13.8 32.5 35.4 168.3 Total contractual obligations $ 458.1 $ 120.4 $ 56.2 $ 49.0 $ 232.5 ____________________ (1) Excludes future contingent costs for utilities, real estate taxes, and operating expenses. In 2010, these costs were $10.3 million. See Note 11(a) to our Financial Statements. (2) Purchase obligations primarily relate to (i) research and development commitments, including those related to clinical trials, (ii) capital expenditures for equipment acquisitions, and (iii) license payments. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may increase or be reduced based on certain future events. Open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table above. (3) Represents payments with respect to facility lease obligations in connection with our lease of facilities in Tarrytown, New York, as described above. See Note 11(a) to our Financial Statements. Under our collaboration with Bayer HealthCare, over the next several years we and Bayer HealthCare will share agreed upon VEGF Trap-Eye development expenses incurred by both companies, under a global development plan, as described above. In addition, under our collaboration agreements with sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare, if the applicable collaboration becomes profitable, we have contingent contractual obligations to reimburse sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare for a defined percentage (generally 50%) of agreed-upon development expenses incurred by sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare, respectively. Profitability under each collaboration will be measured by calculating net sales less agreed-upon expenses. These reimbursements would be deducted from our share of the collaboration profits (and, for our aflibercept collaboration with sanofi-aventis, royalties o n product sales in Japan) otherwise payable to us, unless, in some cases, we elect to reimburse these expenses at a faster rate. Given the 63 uncertainties related to drug development (including the development of aflibercept and co-developed antibody candidates in collaboration with sanofi-aventis and VEGF Trap-Eye in collaboration with Bayer HealthCare), such as the variability in the length of time necessary to develop a product candidate and the ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, we are currently unable to reliably estimate if our collaborations with sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare will become profitable. The amount we need to fund operations will depend on various factors, including the potential regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates, the status of competitive products, the success of our research and development programs, the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities, the status of patents and other intellectual property rights (and pending or future litigation related thereto), the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates, and the continuation, extent, and success of our collaborations with sanofi-aventis and Bayer HealthCare. Clinical trial costs are dependent, among other things, on the size and duration of trials, fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties, the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials, and for supplies, laboratory tests, and other expenses. The amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early-stage clinical trials, regulatory requirements, the duration and results of clinical trials underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate, and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial as described above. Our commercialization costs over approximately the next few years will depend on, among other things, the results of Phase 3 clinical trials of our late-stage product candidates and whether and when such product candidates receive regulatory approval, market potential for such product candidates, and the commercialization terms of our collaboration agreements, if applicable (whereby some or all commercialization costs may be shared with our collaborators). Currently, we are required to pay royalties on product sales of ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS. In the future, if we are able to successfully develop, market, and sell ARCALYST for other indications or certain of our product candidates, we may be required to pay royalties or share the profits from such sales pursuant to our license or collaboration agreements. We expect that expenses related to the filing, prosecution, defense, and enforcement of patents and other intellectual property will continue to be substantial. We believe that our existing capital resources, including funding we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements, will enable us to meet operating needs through at least 2013. However, this is a forward-looking statement based on our current operating plan, and there may be a change in projected revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before such time. For example, in connection with preparing to commercialize and launch potential products that are not licensed to a third party, we could incur substantial pre-marketing and commercialization expenses that could lead us to consume our cash at a faster rate. If there is insufficient capital to fund all of our planned operations and activities, we anticipate that we would (i) seek sources of additional capital through collaborative arrangements and/or additional public or private financing, including debt and equity financing and/or (ii) prioritize available capital to fund selected preclinical and clinical development programs and/or preparations for the potential commercialization of our late-stage product candidates, or license selected products. Other than letters of credits totaling $3.8 million, including the $3.4 million letter of credit issued in connection with our lease for facilities in Tarrytown, New York, as described above, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. In addition, we do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity. As of December 31, 2010, we had $0.7 million of financing available under a capital equipment lease line. Aside from this lease line, we had no other established banking arrangements through which we could obtain short-term financing or a line of credit. In October 2010, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 registering the sale, in one or more offerings, of an indeterminate amount of equity or debt securities, together or separately. Our October 2010 public offering of approximately 6.3 million shares of Common Stock was completed under this shelf r egistration statement; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to complete any additional offerings of securities. Factors influencing the availability of additional financing include our progress in product development and commercialization, investor perception of our prospects, and the general condition of the financial markets. We may not be able to secure the necessary funding through new collaborative arrangements or additional public or private offerings. If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements, we may have to delay, scale-back, or eliminate certain of our research and development activities or future operations. This could materially harm our business. 64 Future Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In October 2009, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance on multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. The amended guidance provides greater ability to separate and allocate consideration to be received in a multiple-element revenue arrangement by requiring the use of estimated selling prices to allocate the consideration, thereby eliminating the use of the residual method of allocation. The amended guidance also requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures surrounding multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This guidance may be applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements. We will adopt this amended guidance effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2011. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements. In March 2010, the FASB amended its authoritative guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition. The milestone method of revenue recognition has now been codified as an acceptable revenue recognition model when a milestone is deemed to be substantive. This guidance may be applied retrospectively to all arrangements or prospectively for milestones achieved after the adoption of the guidance. We will adopt this amended guidance for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2011. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements.
