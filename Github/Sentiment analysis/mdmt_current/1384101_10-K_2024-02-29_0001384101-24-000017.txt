ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A, and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Overview We are a global diagnostics company that empowers clinicians with the high-value insights they need to guide and assure patients at pivotal moments in the race to diagnose and treat cancer. Our high-performing tests enable clinicians to make more confident diagnostic, prognostic and treatment decisions, helping patients avoid unnecessary procedures and interventions, and accelerating time to appropriate treatment, thereby improving outcomes for patients all over the world. We currently offer tests in thyroid cancer (Afirma); prostate cancer (Decipher Prostate); breast cancer (Prosigna); bladder cancer (Decipher Bladder); and interstitial lung diseases (Envisia). Our Percepta Nasal Swab test is being run in our CLIA lab in support of clinical studies and our test for lymphoma is in development as a companion diagnostic. We serve global markets with two complementary models. In the United States, we offer LDTs through our centralized CLIA certified laboratories in South San Francisco and San Diego, California, supported by our cytopathology expertise in Austin, Texas. Additionally, primarily outside of the United States, we provide tests to patients through distribution to laboratories and hospitals that can perform the tests locally. Today, this includes our Prosigna test, and in the future, we intend to offer the Decipher Prostate and Percepta Nasal Swab tests as IVD tests. We believe our broad menu of advanced diagnostic tests, combined with our ability to deliver them globally, differentiates us in the diagnostics industry. In February 2024, we acquired C2i, a minimal residual disease, or MRD, detection company, which will expand our role across the patient cancer journey, moving from providing early decision support to following the patient through treatment, where we will be able to help monitor the success of a therapeutic or surgical intervention, and determine the best course of action for each patient. Macroeconomic Factors Recent interest rate increases and inflation in the United States and other markets globally, as well as turmoil in the global banking and finance system, have heightened the risk of an economic downturn or recession and volatility and have resulted in recent volatility in the capital or credit markets in the United States and globally. Moreover, the continued fluctuation of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies, has impacted and may continue to impact our results of operations. We intend to continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions closely and may determine to take certain financial or operational actions in response to such conditions as appropriate. In addition, the regional conflicts like those between Russia and Ukraine have increased the risk of disruptions to energy supplies in Europe, which may impact our ability to manufacture tests or perform services from our facility in Marseille, France, and other conflicts may adversely impact our business and operating results. Finally, the ongoing conflict in the Middle East may disrupt our Israel business operations and employees which we acquired through our acquisition of C2i. The extent of the macroeconomic factors on our future liquidity and operational performance will depend on certain developments, the impact on our customers' operations; the impact to our sales and renewal cycles; changes in central bank policies and interest rates; rates of inflation; and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. See "Risk Factors" for further discussion. 65 Table of Contents Factors Affecting Our Performance Reported Total Test Volume Our performance depends on the number of tests that we perform and report as completed in our CLIA-certified laboratories and Prosigna tests purchased by our customers. Factors impacting the number of tests that we report as completed include, but are not limited to: the number of samples that we receive that meet the medical indication for each test performed; the quantity and quality of the sample received; receipt of the necessary documentation, such as physician order and patient consent, required to perform, bill and collect for our tests; the patient's ability to pay or provide necessary insurance coverage for the tests performed; the time it takes us or our customers to perform our tests and report the results, including as a result of supply chain challenges (including quality of reagents); the seasonality inherent in our business, such as the impact of work-days per period, timing of industry conferences and timing of when patient deductibles are exceeded, which also impacts the reimbursement we receive from insurers; and our ability to obtain prior authorization or meet other requirements instituted by payers, benefit managers, or regulators necessary to be paid for our tests. Continued Adoption of and Reimbursement for our Products Revenue growth depends on our ability to secure coverage decisions, achieve broader reimbursement from third-party payers, expand our base of prescribing physicians and increase our penetration in existing accounts. Because some payers consider our products experimental and investigational, we may not receive payment for tests and payments we receive may not be at acceptable levels. We expect our revenue growth to increase if more payers make a positive coverage decision and as payers enter into contracts with us, which should enhance our revenue and cash collections. Our sales teams are aligned under our general manager-based structure to focus on specific products and global markets. If we are unable to expand the base of prescribing physicians and penetration within these accounts at an acceptable rate, or if we are not able to execute our strategy for increasing reimbursement and associated collections, we may not be able to effectively increase our revenue. We expect to continue to see pressure from payers to limit the utilization of tests, generally, and we believe more payers are deploying cost containment tactics, such as pre-authorization, reduction of the payer portion of reimbursement and employing laboratory benefit managers to reduce utilization rates. Revenue growth also depends on our ability to secure reimbursement from government payers at a reimbursement rate that is consistent with past reimbursement rates. How We Recognize Revenue We recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , or ASC 606. This process involves identifying the contract with a customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied. Testing Revenue We bill for testing services at the time of test completion as defined by the delivery of test results. We recognize revenue based on estimates of the amount that will ultimately be realized. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, we consider factors such as payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, payment as a percentage of agreed upon rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current developments or changes that could impact reimbursement. These estimates require significant judgment by management. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Generally, cash we receive is collected within 12 months of the date the test is billed. We cannot provide any assurance as to when, if ever, or to what extent, any of these amounts will be collected. Notwithstanding our efforts to obtain payment for these tests, payers may deny our claims, in whole or in part, and we may never receive payment for these tests. 66 Table of Contents We bill list price regardless of contract rate, but only recognize revenue from amounts that we estimate are collectible and meet our revenue recognition criteria. Revenue may not be equal to the billed amount due to a number of factors that we consider when determining revenue accrual rates, including differences in reimbursement rates, the amounts of patient co-payments and co-insurance, the existence of secondary payers, claims denials and the amount we expect to ultimately collect. Finally, when we increase our list price, it will increase the cumulative amounts billed but may not positively impact accrued revenue. In addition, payer contracts generally include the right of offset and payers may offset payments prior to resolving disputes over tests performed. Generally, we determine accrual rates by calculating an average of reimbursement from all payers for tests performed over a four-quarter period as it reduces the effects of temporary volatility and seasonality. The periods selected to determine accrual rates typically are at least six months old because it takes a significant period of time to collect from some payers. We may also determine accrual rates based on other factors such as coverage decisions, contracts, or more recent reimbursement data as appropriate. The average test reimbursement rates will change over time due to a number of factors, including medical coverage decisions by payers, the effects of contracts signed with payers, changes in allowed amounts by payers, our ability to successfully win appeals for payment, and our ability to collect cash payments from third-party payers and individual patients. Historical average reimbursement is not necessarily indicative of future average reimbursement. We incur expense for tests in the period in which the test is conducted and recognize revenue for tests in the period in which our revenue recognition criteria are met. Product Revenue Our products consist of the Prosigna breast cancer assay, the nCounter Analysis System, related diagnostic kits, and services. We recognize product revenue when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products. This process involves identifying the contract with a customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied. A performance obligation is considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer, either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and is separately identified in the contract. Performance obligations are considered satisfied once we have transferred control of a product to the customer, meaning the customer has the ability to use and obtain the benefit of the product. We recognize product revenue for satisfied performance obligations only when there are no uncertainties regarding payment terms or transfer of control. Shipping and handling costs incurred for product shipments are charged to our customers and included in product revenue. Revenue is presented net of the taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities. Biopharmaceutical and Other Revenue We enter into arrangements to license or provide access to our assets or services, including clinical services, research and development, contract manufacturing and development, as well as other services. Such arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, data, services, manufactured diagnostic test kits, access and/or testing services to partner biopharmaceutical and other companies. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration paid to us in the form of nonrefundable fees; payments on delivery of data, test results or manufactured products; costs of service plus margin; performance milestone payments; expense reimbursements and possibly royalty and/or other payments. Net sales of data or other services to our customers are recognized in accordance with ASC 606 and are classified under biopharmaceutical and other revenue. Payments received that are not related to sales or services to a customer are recorded as offsets against research and development expense or cost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. In arrangements involving more than one good or service delivered to a customer, each good or service is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand-alone basis or using an adjusted market assessment approach if the selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available. 67 Table of Contents The consideration allocated to each distinct performance obligation is recognized as revenue when control is transferred which may be at a point in time or over time. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Should there be royalties, we utilize the sales and usage-based royalty exception in arrangements that resulted from the license of intellectual property, recognizing revenue generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur. Timing of Our Research and Development Expenses We deploy state-of-the-art and costly genomic technologies in our biomarker discovery experiments, and our spending on these technologies may vary substantially from quarter to quarter. We also spend a significant amount on activities to secure clinical trial results in support of our testing and product development portfolio and on-market tests, as well as clinical validation and utilization studies. The timing of these research and development activities is difficult to predict, as is the timing of clinical trial enrollments and sample acquisitions. If a substantial number of clinical samples are acquired in a given quarter or if a high-cost experiment is conducted in one quarter versus the next, the timing of these expenses can affect our financial results. We conduct clinical studies to validate our new products, as well as on-going clinical studies to further the published evidence to support our commercialized tests. As these studies are initiated, start-up costs for each site can be significant and concentrated in a specific quarter. Spending on research and development, for both experiments and studies, may vary significantly by quarter depending on the timing of these various expenses. Financial Overview Revenue Through December 31, 2023, we derived most of our revenue from the sale of Decipher and Afirma tests, delivered primarily to physicians in the United States. We generally invoice third-party payers upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician. As such, we take the assignment of benefits and the risk of cash collection from the third-party payer and individual patients. Third-party payers and other customers in excess of 10% of total revenue and their related revenue as a percentage of total revenue were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Medicare 31 % 31 % 30 % UnitedHealthcare 10 % 10 % 10 % 41 % 41 % 40 % For tests performed, we recognize the related revenue upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician based on the amount that we expect to ultimately receive. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, we consider factors such as payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, payment as a percentage of agreed upon reimbursement rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current development or changes that could impact reimbursement. Upon ultimate collection, the amount received is compared to previous estimates and the amount accrued is adjusted accordingly. Our ability to increase our revenue will depend on our ability to penetrate the market, obtain positive coverage policies from additional third-party payers, obtain reimbursement and/or enter into contracts with additional third-party payers for our current and new tests, and increase reimbursement rates for tests performed. Finally, should the judgments underlying our estimated reimbursement change, our accrued revenue and financial results could be negatively impacted in future periods. Cost of Testing Revenue The components of our cost of testing revenue are sample collection kit costs, reagent expenses, compensation expense, license fees and royalties, depreciation, other expenses such as equipment and laboratory supplies, and allocations of facility and information technology expenses. Costs associated with performing tests are recorded as the test is processed regardless of whether and when revenue is recognized with respect to that test. As a result, our cost of testing revenue as a percentage of testing revenue may vary significantly from period to period because we may not recognize all revenue in the period in which the associated costs are incurred. We expect cost of testing revenue in absolute dollars to increase as the number of tests we 68 Table of Contents perform increases. However, we expect that the cost per test will decrease over time due to leveraging fixed costs, efficiencies we may gain as test volume increases and from automation, process efficiencies and other cost reductions. As we introduce new tests, initially our cost of testing revenue will be high as we expect to run suboptimal batch sizes, run quality control batches, test batches, registry samples, and generally incur costs that may suppress or reduce gross margins. This will disproportionately increase our aggregate cost of testing revenue until we achieve efficiencies in processing these new tests. Cost of Product Revenue Our cost of product revenue consists primarily of costs of purchasing instruments and diagnostic kits from third-party contract manufacturers, installation, warranty, service and packaging and delivery costs. In addition, cost of product revenue includes royalty costs for licensed technologies included in our products and labor expenses. As our Prosigna test kits are sold in various configurations with different number of tests, our product cost per test will vary based on the specific kit configuration purchased by customers. Cost of Biopharmaceutical and Other Revenue Our cost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue are the costs of performing activities under arrangements that require us to perform research and development, commercialization, contract manufacturing and development, and previously included contract testing services on behalf of a customer. This cost is mainly composed of compensation expense, manufacturing and laboratory supplies and pass-through costs. Research and Development Research and development expenses include expenses incurred to collect clinical samples and conduct clinical studies to develop and support our products and pipeline, as well as develop future technology. These expenses consist of compensation expenses, direct research and development expenses such as laboratory supplies and costs associated with setting up and conducting clinical studies at domestic and international sites, professional fees, depreciation and amortization, other miscellaneous expenses and allocation of facility and information technology expenses. We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. We incurred a majority of our research and development expenses in the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 in support of our early-stage products, including Percepta Nasal Swab, as well as the development of new IVD products. Going forward, we expect to incur significant expense as we invest in the development of our innovation engine, early-stage products including our MRD tests, required clinical studies and the development of current tests on multiple IVD platforms. Selling and Marketing Selling and marketing expenses consist of compensation expenses, direct marketing expenses, professional fees, other expenses such as travel and communications costs, as well as allocation of facility and information technology expenses. Our sales team of approximately 120 representatives is organized by business unit in the United States, with separate teams calling on thyroid cancer, urologic cancers, and pulmonology physicians. The business units have dedicated marketing support, as well as a marketing operations team that serves the commercial organization broadly. Prosigna sales outside of the United States are led by country managers that call on laboratories and breast cancer oncologists and have dedicated marketing support. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include compensation expenses for executive officers and administrative, billing and client service personnel, professional fees for legal and audit services, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, and other expenses such as information technology and miscellaneous expenses, offset by allocation of facility and information technology expenses to other functions. General and administrative expenses include costs related to the acquisitions of Decipher Biosciences and HalioDx, which were included in general and administrative compensation expense and professional fees. We expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we build our infrastructure to scale revenue growth, and to decline as a percentage of revenue thereafter. 69 Table of Contents Intangible Asset Amortization Our finite-lived intangible assets, acquired in business combinations, are being amortized over 4 to 15 years, using the straight-line method. Amortization expense is expected to be approximately $13.5 million per year through 2024 and decrease thereafter. Other Income (Loss), Net Other income (loss), net consists primarily of interest income from our cash held in interest bearing accounts, realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, and French research tax credits. The French research tax credits (cr dit d imp t recherche, or CIR) are generated by our wholly owned subsidiary, Veracyte SAS, in connection with its research efforts performed in Marseille, France. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates. Testing Revenue We recognize revenue from the sale of our tests performed for customers, including patients and institutions, at the time test results are reported to physicians. Most tests requested by customers are sold without a written agreement; however, we determine that an implied contract exists with our customers for whom a physician will order the test. We identify each sale of our test to a customer as a single performance obligation. A stated contract price does not exist and the transaction price for each implied contract with our customer represents variable consideration. We estimate the variable consideration under the portfolio approach and consider the historical reimbursement data from third-party commercial and governmental payers and patients, as well as known or anticipated reimbursement trends not reflected in the historical data. We monitor the estimated amount to be collected in the portfolio at each reporting period based on actual cash collections in order to assess whether a revision to the estimate is required. Both the estimate and any subsequent revision contain uncertainty and require the use of significant judgment in the estimation of the variable consideration and application of the constraint for such variable consideration. We analyze actual cash collections over the expected reimbursement period and compare it with the estimated variable consideration for each portfolio and any difference is recognized as an adjustment to estimated revenue after the expected reimbursement period, subject to assessment of the risk of future revenue reversal. Product Revenue Our products consist of the Prosigna breast cancer assay, the nCounter Analysis System, related diagnostic kits, and services. We recognize product revenue when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products. Shipping and handling costs incurred for product shipments are charged to our customers and included in product revenue. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities. Biopharmaceutical and Other Revenues For biopharmaceutical and other revenue, we develop estimates and assumptions that require judgment to determine the underlying stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation which determines how the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations. The estimation of the stand-alone selling price may include independent evidence of 70 Table of Contents market price, forecasted revenues or costs, development timelines, discount rates, and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. We evaluate each performance obligation to determine if they can be satisfied at a point in time or over time, and we measure the services delivered to the collaborative partner which are periodically reviewed based on the progress of the related program. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. The effect of any change made to an estimated input component and, therefore revenue or expense recognized, would be recorded as a change in estimate. In addition, variable consideration must be evaluated to determine if it is constrained and, therefore, excluded from the transaction price. At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments (variable consideration), we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amounts to be included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within either party control, such as non-operational developmental and regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of milestones that are within either party control, such as operational developmental milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. Revisions to our estimate of the transaction price may also result in negative revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. Other Significant Accounting Policies Acquisitions We first determine whether a set of assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business and should be accounted for as a business combination. If the assets acquired are not a business, we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition. Business combinations are accounted for by using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in our consolidated financial statements. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with a business combination are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and remeasured at each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved, with the resulting changes in fair value recorded in earnings. The estimation of the fair value of the contingent consideration is based on the present value of the expected payments calculated by assessing the likelihood of when the related milestones would be achieved, discounted using our estimated borrowing rate. Intangible Asset Amortization We have acquired finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets in business combinations. These intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date and are subject to potential adjustments within the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition dates. The fair values of the intangible assets are generally determined using income approaches such as the multi-period excess earnings method, the with-and-without method and the relief from royalty method. These income approaches are based on various estimates for each asset including the estimate of future cash flows including, revenue assumptions (such as projected testing volumes, growth rates), discount rates and the expected economic life/obsolescence factors of the respective assets. Our finite-lived intangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 4 to 15 years, based on management's estimate of the period over which their economic benefits will be realized, product life and patent life. Our in-process research and development, or IPR&D, is not amortized until it becomes commercially viable and placed in service. At the time when the IPR&D is placed in service, we will determine a useful life. We test these intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value below their carrying amounts. Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Our goodwill evaluation is based on both qualitative and quantitative assessments regarding the fair value of goodwill relative to its carrying value. We have determined that we operate in a single segment and have a single reporting unit associated with the development and commercialization of diagnostic products. In the event we determine that it is more likely than not the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, quantitative testing is performed comparing 71 Table of Contents recorded values to estimated fair values. If impairment is present, the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the recorded goodwill over its implied fair value. We perform our annual evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. There was no impairment recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021. Stock-based Compensation We recognize stock-based compensation expense for only those shares underlying stock options and restricted stock units that we expect to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option's expected term and stock price volatility. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Performance-based stock units, which vest upon the achievement of certain performance conditions, are subject to the employees continued service with us. The probability of vesting is assessed at each reporting period and compensation cost is adjusted based on this probability assessment. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Supplies and Inventory Supplies consists of materials and reagents consumed in the performance of testing services. Inventory consists of raw materials consumed in the contract manufacturing process as well as finished and semi-finished components used in the assembly of diagnostic kits related to product sales. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a weighted average basis. We periodically analyze supply and inventory levels and expiration dates, and write down supply or inventory that has become obsolete, that has a cost basis in excess of its net realizable value, or in excess of expected sales requirements as cost of revenue. We record an allowance for excess or obsolete supplies and inventory using an estimate based on historical trends and evaluation of near-term expirations. Leases We determine if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in right-of-use assets - operating leases and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, representing our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use, or ROU, assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments. The ROU assets also includes any lease payments made and is adjusted for lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease which are recognized when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease component. Financing leases are immaterial and are included in property and equipment, net and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Leases with terms of 12 months or less are not recorded on our balance sheet. Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of our foreign subsidiary, Veracyte SAS, is the Euro. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders equity. Revenue and expenses from our foreign subsidiaries are translated using the monthly average exchange rates in effect during the period in which the transactions occur. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income (loss), net, on the consolidated statements of operations. Comprehensive Loss Comprehensive loss is the change in stockholders equity from transactions and other events and circumstances other than those resulting from investments by stockholders and distributions to stockholders. Our comprehensive loss includes our net loss and gains and losses from the foreign currency translation of the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries. 72 Table of Contents Results of Operations Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands of dollars, except percentages and test volume) Year Ended December 31, 2023 Change % 2022 Revenue: Testing revenue $ 326,542 $ 75,998 30 % $ 250,544 Product revenue 15,588 2,956 23 % 12,632 Biopharmaceutical and other revenue 18,921 (14,439) (43) % 33,360 Total revenue 361,051 64,515 22 % 296,536 Operating expense: Cost of testing revenue 88,913 13,596 18 % 75,317 Cost of product revenue 8,666 846 11 % 7,820 Cost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue 15,324 (3,121) (17) % 18,445 Research and development 57,305 16,702 41 % 40,603 Selling and marketing 101,490 3,930 4 % 97,560 General and administrative 86,229 13,029 18 % 73,200 Impairment of long-lived assets 68,349 65,031 1,960 % 3,318 Intangible asset amortization 20,570 (784) (4) % 21,354 Total operating expenses 446,846 109,229 32 % 337,617 Loss from operations (85,795) (44,714) (109) % (41,081) Other income, net 9,183 4,529 97 % 4,654 Loss before income tax benefit (76,612) (40,185) 110 % (36,427) Income tax (benefit) provision (2,208) (2,341) (1,760) % 133 Net loss $ (74,404) $ (37,844) (104) % $ (36,560) Other Operating Data: Diagnostic tests reported 115,785 22,445 24 % 93,340 Product tests sold 11,192 2,008 22 % 9,184 Total test volume 126,977 24,453 24 % 102,524 Depreciation and amortization expense $ 27,188 $ 1,260 5 % $ 25,928 Stock-based compensation expense $ 33,489 $ 6,033 22 % $ 27,456 Revenue Revenue increased $64.5 million, or 22%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. This was primarily due to a $76.0 million increase in testing revenue driven by a 24% volume increase, partially offset by a $14.4 million decrease in our Biopharmaceutical and other revenue. Testing revenue and volume reported for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased primarily due to Afirma and Decipher Prostate tests as well as a $7.0 million impact from improved cash collections compared to the prior year. Product revenue increased $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022, driven primarily by product tests kits sold. Biopharmaceutical and other revenue decreased by $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 driven primarily by the reduction of customer projects given overall spending constraints across the industry. Comparison of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated March 1, 2023. 73 Table of Contents Cost of revenue Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows (in thousands of dollars, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2023 Change % 2022 Cost of testing revenue: Laboratory expense $ 46,876 $ 9,374 25 % $ 37,502 Sample collection expense 10,814 1,181 12 % 9,633 Compensation expense 18,534 1,516 9 % 17,018 License fees and royalties 90 15 20 % 75 Depreciation and amortization 1,521 274 22 % 1,247 Other expenses 3,946 (134) (3) % 4,080 Allocations 7,132 1,370 24 % 5,762 Total $ 88,913 $ 13,596 18 % $ 75,317 Cost of product revenue: Product costs $ 6,362 $ 483 8 % $ 5,879 License fees and royalties 1,242 153 14 % 1,089 Depreciation and amortization 316 165 109 % 151 Other expenses 586 (34) (5) % 620 Allocations 160 79 98 % 81 Total $ 8,666 $ 846 11 % $ 7,820 Cost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue: Compensation expense $ 7,747 $ (1,188) (13) % $ 8,935 License fees and royalties (2) (172) (101) % 170 Depreciation and amortization 347 (53) (13) % 400 Other expenses 5,267 (3,465) (40) % 8,732 Allocations 1,965 1,757 845 % 208 Total $ 15,324 $ (3,121) (17) % $ 18,445 Cost of testing revenue increased $13.6 million, or 18.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in cost of testing revenue is due to increased volume in testing, primarily related to Afirma and Decipher Prostate. Cost of product revenue is related to sales of Prosigna and nCounter Analysis Systems. Cost of product revenue increased $0.8 million, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, driven by increased product test volume. Cost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue includes labor costs incurred by our employees working on customer projects and laboratory supplies and pass-through expenses incurred on these projects. Cost of biopharmaceutical and other revenue decreased by $3.1 million driven by reductions of variable expenses related to projects. Comparison of cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated March 1, 2023. 74 Table of Contents Research and development Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows (in thousands of dollars, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2023 Change % 2022 Research and development expense Compensation expense $ 29,180 $ 1,797 7 % $ 27,383 Direct research and development expense 12,918 7,243 128 % 5,675 Depreciation and amortization 939 415 79 % 524 Other expenses 9,341 5,195 125 % 4,146 Allocations 4,927 2,052 71 % 2,875 Total $ 57,305 $ 16,702 41 % $ 40,603 Research and development expense increased $16.7 million, or 41%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in compensation expense was primarily due to annual merit compensation increases. The increase in direct research and development expense was primarily related to our on-going clinical studies including, but not limited to, furthering the support and clinical utility evidence of our Percepta Nasal Swab test and urology products. The increase in other expenses was primarily driven by increased support in developing our IVD strategy including a one-time technology access fee of $3.5 million dollars to develop our IVD kitted tests on the Illumina NextSeqDx sequencing platform. Comparison of research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated March 1, 2023. Selling and marketing Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows (in thousands of dollars, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2023 Change % 2022 Selling and marketing expense: Compensation expense $ 74,886 $ 2,628 4 % $ 72,258 Direct marketing expense 5,422 (716) (12) % 6,138 Other expenses 14,584 1,099 8 % 13,485 Allocations 6,598 919 16 % 5,679 Total $ 101,490 $ 3,930 4 % $ 97,560 Selling and marketing expense increased $3.9 million, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in compensation expense was primarily due to additional employees hired and related higher commissions to support the growth of Afirma and Decipher test volume. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to increased travel and entertainment to also support growth of Afirma and the Decipher test volume. The increases were partially offset by reduced expenses related to Immunoscore and Percepta support. Comparison of selling and marketing expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated March 1, 2023. 75 Table of Contents General and administrative Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows (in thousands of dollars, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2023 Change % 2022 General and administrative expense: Compensation expense $ 63,769 $ 12,412 24 % $ 51,357 Occupancy costs 8,112 2,296 39 % 5,816 Depreciation and amortization 3,487 1,242 55 % 2,245 Other expenses 31,643 3,256 11 % 28,387 Allocations (20,782) (6,177) 42 % (14,605) Total $ 86,229 $ 13,029 18 % $ 73,200 General and administrative expense increased $13.0 million, or 18%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. Compensation expense primarily increased due to $8.0 million in incremental functional headcount and variable compensation plan spend along with a $2.7 million increase in stock-based compensation, inclusive of $1.4 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the departure of our former executive chair in June 2023. Occupancy costs increased due to our San Diego facilities expansion while other expenses increased due to infrastructure buildout and expenses related to the C2i acquisition. These were partially offset by the $5.5 million impact from a revaluation of contingent consideration in relation to our IVD strategy expansion. General and administrative expenses related to occupancy costs and information technology costs are allocated monthly to general and administrative expense, selling and marketing expense, research and development expense, and cost of revenue based on the headcount and employee location. Comparison of general and administrative expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated March 1, 2023. Impairment of long-lived assets During 2023, we moved to adopt a multi-platform IVD strategy that will enable us to more rapidly reach more patients globally with our tests. As a result, we reviewed our long-lived assets for impairment and recorded a $34.9 million impairment charge associated with the nCounter Dx license finite-lived intangible asset in the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, during 2023, due to a significant change in the business environment, we recorded a $32.0 million impairment charge associated with HalioDx biopharmaceutical services developed technology, customer relationships and customer backlog finite-lived intangible assets. Impairment of long-lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2023 also includes $1.4 million of impairment of right-of-use and fixed assets in relation to exiting our Richmond facility. During 2022, we decided to cease commercialization efforts related to our stand-alone Immunoscore Colon Dx commercial offering. As a result, we reviewed our long-lived assets for impairment and recorded a $3.3 million impairment charge associated with our HalioDx Immunoscore Colon Dx developed technology finite-lived intangible asset for the year ended December 31, 2022. Other income, net Other income, net, increased $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to an increase of $5.4 million of interest and dividend income partially offset by a decrease of $1.9 million related to reserves established for the French research tax credit receivable and revisions to the current year estimate. Comparison of Other income, net, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated March 1, 2023. 76 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources From inception through December 31, 2023, we have been financed primarily through net proceeds from the sale of our equity securities. We have incurred net losses since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we had net losses of $74.4 million, $36.6 million and $75.6 million, respectively, and we expect to incur additional losses in 2024 and potentially in future years. As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $468.1 million. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents of $216.5 million as of December 31, 2023, and cash flows generated by our revenue during the next 12 months will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. We expect that our near- and longer-term liquidity requirements will continue to consist of costs to run our laboratories, research and development expenses, selling and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, working capital, capital expenditures, lease obligations, potential milestones associated with the C2i acquisition and general corporate expenses associated with the growth of our business. However, we may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products that would change our cash requirements. If we are not able to generate cash flows from our revenue to finance our cash requirements, we will need to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, borrowings or strategic collaborations or licensing arrangements. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. The incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance of certain equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights, restrictions on our cash and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. In addition, the issuance of additional equity securities by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the event that we enter into collaborations or licensing arrangements to raise capital, we may be required to accept unfavorable terms. These agreements may require that we relinquish or license to a third-party on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves, or reserve certain opportunities for future potential arrangements when we might be able to achieve more favorable terms. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs or selling and marketing initiatives, or forgo potential acquisitions or investments. In addition, we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our products or development programs, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us. Moreover, any instability in the global banking system may impact liquidity both in the short term and long term and may result in adverse impacts to our or our customers business, including in our customers ability to pay for our products. Public Offering of Common Stock In February 2021, we issued and sold 8,547,297 shares of common stock in a registered public offering, including 1,114,864 shares issued and sold upon the underwriters exercise in full of their option to purchase additional shares, at a price to the public of $74.00 per share. Our net proceeds from the offering were approximately $593.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of $38.7 million. Operating Leases We lease office and laboratory facilities in South San Francisco and San Diego, California; Austin, Texas; Marseille, France; and Richmond, Virginia, and lease certain equipment under various non-cancelable lease agreements. The lease terms extend to January 2029 and contain extension of lease term and expansion options. As of December 31, 2023, the leases have a weighted average remaining lease term of 2.7 years and total future minimum lease payments of $14.0 million. As of December 31, 2023, Veracyte SAS has signed a lease agreement for facilities which will be constructed in Marseille, France. The lease will commence upon completion of the construction of the office building at which time we will record a lease liability and a corresponding right-of-use asset. The initial term of the lease will be twelve years with annual rent of approximately $1.3 million, which is subject to change based on final construction. 77 Table of Contents Supplies Purchase Commitments We had non-cancelable purchase commitments with suppliers to purchase a minimum quantity of supplies for approximately $19.4 million at December 31, 2023. Acquisition-Related Contingent Consideration As part of our agreement to acquire the exclusive global diagnostic license to the nCounter Analysis System, we may pay up to an additional $10.0 million in cash, contingent upon first achievement or occurrence, by or on behalf of Veracyte, of the commercial launch of the first, second and third diagnostic tests for use on the nCounter multiplex analysis system. As of December 31, 2023, the achievement of one of the milestones is forecasted to occur within the next 12 months, requiring payments totaling $3.5 million. HalioDx Acquisition-Related Payments In connection with the HalioDx Acquisition, 11,031 unvested HalioDx free ordinary share awards, or free shares, were modified to provide us the right to purchase the vested free shares (call option) from the holders and the holders the right to sell the vested free shares to us (put option) from time to time through late 2023. As a result of the call and put options, the free shares are liability classified. Additionally, in connection with the HalioDx Acquisition, all of HalioDx's equity-classified options that were outstanding prior to the HalioDx Acquisition were terminated and cancelled at the acquisition date. We committed to pay cash consideration of $1.5 million to holders of unvested options on the date the employee satisfies the original service requirement. As part of the agreement, we held back $16.8 million of the cash consideration, or the holdback. Fifty percent of the holdback was placed in escrow on the founders' behalf on the first anniversary of the closing date and the remainder was paid directly to the founders who remained employed with Veracyte on the second anniversary. As of December 31, 2023, there were no remaining amounts for these HalioDx related items to be paid.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently adopted accounting pronouncements In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires entities to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The update will generally result in an entity recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities at amounts consistent with those recorded by the acquiree immediately before the acquisition date rather than at fair value. The new standard is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption 79 Table of Contents permitted. We adopted this guidance in 2023 and such adoption had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740) . The update requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. This ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. We expect this ASU will result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted.
