For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, selling, general and administrative expenses reflect expenses of $5.6 million (net of related insurance recovery of $0.6 million) and $2.5 million, respectively, related to the data security incidents. 43 Table of Contents Overview Description of Business At September 30, 2015, we operated primarily through two business units, Sally Beauty Supply and Beauty Systems Group, or BSG. We believe the Company is the largest open-line distributor of professional beauty supplies in the U.S. based on store count. As of September 30, 2015, through Sally Beauty Supply and BSG, we had a multi-channel platform of 4,792 company-operated stores and supplied 175 franchised stores primarily in North America and selected South American and European countries. Within BSG, we also have one of the largest networks of professional distributor sales consultants in North America. We provide our customers with a wide variety of leading third-party branded and exclusive-label professional beauty supplies, including hair color products, hair care products, styling appliances, skin and nail care products and other beauty items. Sally Beauty Supply stores target retail consumers and salon professionals, while BSG exclusively targets salons and salon professionals. For the year ended September 30, 2015, our consolidated net sales and operating earnings were $3,834.3 million and $495.3 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2015, Sally Beauty Supply operated 3,655 company-operated retail stores, 2,868 of which are located in the U.S., with the remaining 787 company-operated stores located in Canada, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Peru, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Sally Beauty Supply also supplied 18 franchised stores located in the United Kingdom, Belgium and certain other European countries. In the U.S. and Canada, our Sally Beauty Supply stores average approximately 1,700 square feet in size and are located primarily in strip shopping centers. Our Sally Beauty Supply stores carry an extensive selection of professional beauty supplies for both retail customers and salon professionals, featuring an average of 8,000 SKUs of beauty products across product categories including hair color, hair care, skin and nail care, beauty sundries and electrical appliances. Sally Beauty Supply stores carry leading third-party brands, such as Clairol , CHI , China Glaze , OPI and Conair , as well as an extensive selection of exclusive-label merchandise. Store formats, including average size and product selection, for Sally Beauty Supply outside the U.S. and Canada vary by marketplace. For the year ended September 30, 2015, Sally Beauty Supply's net sales and segment operating profit were $2,329.5 million and $412.4 million, respectively, representing 61% and 64% of our consolidated net sales and consolidated operating profit before unallocated corporate expenses and share-based compensation expenses, respectively. We believe BSG is the largest full-service distributor of professional beauty supplies in North America, exclusively targeting salons and salon professionals. As of September 30, 2015, BSG had 1,137 company-operated stores, supplied 157 franchised stores and had a sales force of approximately 958 professional distributor sales consultants selling exclusively to salons and salon professionals in the U.S., and in Canada, Mexico and certain European countries. Company-operated BSG stores, which primarily operate under the CosmoProf banner, average approximately 2,600 square feet in size and are primarily located in secondary strip shopping centers. BSG stores provide a comprehensive selection of beauty products featuring an average of 9,000 SKUs that include hair color and care, skin and nail care, beauty sundries and electrical appliances. Through BSG's large store base and sales force, BSG is able to access a significant portion of the highly fragmented U.S. salon industry. BSG stores carry leading third-party brands such as Paul Mitchell , Wella , Sebastian , Goldwell , Joico and Aquage , intended for use in salons and for resale by the salons to consumers. BSG is also the exclusive source for certain well-known third-party branded products pursuant to exclusive distribution agreements with certain suppliers within specified geographic territories. For the year ended September 30, 2015, BSG's net sales and segment operating profit were $1,504.8 million and $231.2 million, respectively, representing 39% and 36% of our consolidated net sales and consolidated operating profit before unallocated corporate expenses and share-based compensation expenses, respectively. 44 Table of Contents Key Industry and Business Trends We operate primarily within the large and growing U.S. beauty supply industry. We believe that a number of key industry and business trends and characteristics will influence our business and our financial results going forward. These key trends and characteristics are discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report. Please see "Key Industry and Business Trends" in Item 1 of this Annual Report. Significant Recent Acquisitions In the fiscal year 2013, the Company acquired certain assets and business operations of Essential Salon Products, Inc. ("Essential Salon"), a professional-only distributor of beauty products operating in the northeastern region of the United States, for approximately $15.3 million, subject to certain adjustments. The results of operations of Essential Salon are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition date. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets subject to amortization of $9.1 million, were recorded based on their preliminary estimated fair values at the acquisition date. In addition, goodwill of $3.1 million (which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes) was recorded as a result of this acquisition. We funded this acquisition primarily with cash from operations and borrowings under the ABL facility. In addition, we completed several other individually immaterial acquisitions during the fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 at the aggregate cost of approximately $7.1 million, $4.9 million and $6.8 million, respectively. We recorded intangible assets subject to amortization of $2.2 million, $1.4 million and $4.0 million in connection with these acquisitions completed in the fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, we recorded goodwill in the amount of $2.8 million, $2.6 million and $2.0 million, the majority of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes, in connection with these individually immaterial acquisitions. We funded these acquisitions primarily with cash from operations and borrowings under the ABL facility. The valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with these acquisitions was based on their fair values at the acquisition date. Share Repurchase Programs In August 2014, we announced that the Board had approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock over a period of approximately three years (the "2014 Share Repurchase Program"). The 2014 Share Repurchase Program expires on September 30, 2017. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 8.1 million shares of our common stock under the 2014 Share Repurchase Program at a cost of $227.6 million. In addition, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we repurchased and retired approximately 12.6 million shares of our common stock under the 2013 Share Repurchase Program (a share repurchase program approved by our Board in March 2013 and terminated in connection with the authorization of the 2014 Share Repurchase Program) at a cost of $333.3 million and, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 18.9 million shares of our common stock under the 2013 Share Repurchase Program and the 2012 Share Repurchase Program (a share repurchase program approved by our Board in August 2012 and terminated in connection with the authorization of the 2013 Share Repurchase Program) at a cost of $509.7 million. We reduced common stock and additional paid-in capital, in the aggregate, by these amounts. However, as required by GAAP, to the extent that the share repurchase amounts exceeded the balance of additional paid-in capital prior to such repurchases, we recorded the excess in accumulated deficit. We funded these share repurchases with cash from operations, borrowings under the ABL facility and a portion of the cash proceeds from our September 2012 and October 2013 debt issuances. 45 Table of Contents Data Security Incidents In March 2014, we disclosed that we had experienced a data security incident (the "2014 data security incident"). In May 2015, we disclosed that we had experienced a second illegal intrusion into our payment card systems (together with the 2014 data security incident, the "data security incidents").The data security incidents involved the unauthorized installation of malicious software (malware) on our information technology systems, including our point-of-sale systems that, we believe, may have illegally accessed and removed a portion of the payment card data (track 2) for some transactions. The costs that the Company has incurred to date in connection with the data security incidents primarily include professional advisory fees and legal costs and expenses relating to investigating and remediating the data security incidents. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, selling, general and administrative expenses reflect expenses of $5.6 million (net of related insurance recovery of $0.6 million) and $2.5 million, respectively, related to the data security incidents, inclusive, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, of an accrued liability of approximately $2.9 million related to potential litigation costs and expenses associated with the 2014 data security incident. We expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to the data security incidents in future periods. These costs may result from potential liabilities to payment card networks, governmental or third party investigations, proceedings or litigation and legal and other fees necessary to defend against any potential liabilities or claims, and further investigatory and remediation costs. Please see "Risk Factors We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems, " " Unauthorized access to confidential information and data on our information technology systems and security and data breaches could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results " and " We have experienced data security incidents and are not yet able to determine the full extent or scope of the potential liabilities relating to these data security incidents. " Cost Rationalization Initiatives In June 2015, the Board approved an initiative to restructure our Sally Beauty Supply operations in Germany (the "Germany restructuring"), which included the closing of 15 underperforming retail stores and two supporting administrative offices. This initiative is part of our ongoing cost rationalization efforts designed to increase the profitability of our Sally Beauty Supply segment's international operations. After completion of the Germany restructuring, which was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, we continue to operate 18 retail stores in Germany. In connection with the Germany restructuring we incurred pre-tax expenses in the aggregate amount of approximately 4.7 million ($5.3 million, at the weighted average exchange rate during the relevant period), including costs associated with lease obligations, asset impairments, employee severance, and other business transition and exit costs. Of this amount, approximately 2.2 million ($2.5 million, at the weighted average exchange rate during the relevant period) were non-cash expenses resulting from asset impairments. In addition, approximately 0.4 million ($0.4 million, at the weighted average exchange rate during the relevant period) represent one-time employee severance payments. The Germany restructuring expenses are included in cost of products sold and distribution expenses ( 1.2 million, $1.4 million, at the weighted average exchange rate during the relevant period) and in selling, general and administrative expenses reflect expenses ( 3.5 million, $3.9 million, at the weighted average exchange rate during the relevant period) in the Company's consolidated statements of earnings, based on the nature of the costs incurred. At September 30, 2015, the Company believes that any future costs of the Germany restructuring, primarily relating to remaining obligations under operating leases, will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's future operating results or cash flows. 46 Table of Contents Other Significant Items Derivative Instruments As a multinational corporation, we are subject to certain market risks including changes in market interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. We may consider a variety of practices in the ordinary course of our business to manage these market risks including, when deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments such as foreign currency options, collars and forwards (hereafter, "foreign exchange contracts") and interest rate swaps. Currently, we do not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Foreign Currency Derivative Instruments We are exposed to potential gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments in subsidiaries (including intercompany balances not permanently invested) and earnings denominated in foreign currencies, as well as exposure resulting from the purchase of merchandise by certain of our subsidiaries in a currency other than their functional currency and from the sale of products and services among the parent company and subsidiaries with a functional currency different from the parent or among subsidiaries with different functional currencies. Our primary exposures are to changes in exchange rates for the U.S. dollar versus the Euro, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Chilean peso and the Mexican peso. In addition, from time to time we may have exposure to changes in the exchange rate for the British pound sterling versus the Euro in connection with the sale of products and services among certain European subsidiaries of the Company. Our various foreign currency exposures at times offset each other, sometimes providing a natural hedge against foreign currency risk. In connection with the remaining foreign currency risk, the Company from time to time uses foreign exchange contracts to effectively fix the foreign currency exchange rate applicable to specific anticipated foreign currency-denominated cash flows, thus limiting the potential fluctuations in such cash flows resulting from foreign currency market movements. The Company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the exposure to the U.S. dollar resulting from certain of its Sinelco Group subsidiaries' purchases of merchandise from third-party suppliers. Sinelco's functional currency is the Euro. As such, at September 30, 2015, we hold foreign currency forwards which enable us to sell approximately 12.8 million ($14.3 million, at the September 30, 2015 exchange rate) at the weighted average contractual exchange rate of 1.1248. The foreign currency forwards discussed in this paragraph are with a single counterparty and expire ratably through September 15, 2016. The Company also uses foreign exchange contracts to mitigate its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with certain intercompany balances not permanently invested. As such, at September 30, 2015, we hold: (a) a foreign currency forward which enables us to sell approximately 28.5 million ($31.9 million, at the September 30, 2015 exchange rate) at the contractual exchange rate of 1.1274, (b) a foreign currency forward which enables us to sell approximately $5.0 million Canadian dollars ($3.8 million, at the September 30, 2015 exchange rate) at the contractual exchange rate of 1.3353, (c) a foreign currency forward which enables us to buy approximately $12.0 million Canadian dollars ($9.0 million, at the September 30, 2015 exchange rate) at the contractual exchange rate of 1.3452, (d) a foreign currency forward which enables us to sell approximately 18.5 million Mexican pesos ($1.1 million, at the September 30, 2015 exchange rate) at the contractual exchange rate of 16.9455 and (e) a foreign currency forward which enables us to buy approximately 7.8 million ($11.8 million, at the September 30, 2015 exchange rate) at the contractual exchange rate of 1.5157. All the foreign currency forwards discussed in this paragraph are with a single counterparty (not the same counterparty as that on the forwards discussed in the preceding paragraph) and expire on or before December 31, 2015. The Company's foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and do not currently meet the requirements for hedge accounting. Accordingly, the changes in the fair value (i.e., marked-to-market adjustments) of these derivative instruments (which are adjusted quarterly) are recorded in selling, general 47 Table of Contents and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, selling, general and administrative expenses included $2.7 million in net gains from all of the Company's foreign exchange contracts, including marked-to-market adjustments. Please see "Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign currency exchange rate risk" and Note 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. Share-Based Compensation Awards For the fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, total share-based compensation expenses charged against earnings, and included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $16.8 million, $22.1 million and $19.2 million, respectively, and resulted in an increase in additional paid-in capital by the same amounts. For the fiscal year 2014, share-based compensation expenses reflect an expense of $3.5 million in connection with the executive management transition plan disclosed in May 2014. Share-based compensation expenses for the fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 included $4.8 million, $8.8 million (including the expense of $3.5 million in connection with the executive management transition plan) and $5.9 million, respectively, of accelerated expense related to certain retirement eligible employees who are eligible to continue vesting awards upon retirement under the terms of the Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. Amended and Restated 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "2010 Plan"). For the fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, the total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings from all share-based compensation plans in which our employees participate or participated was $6.3 million, $8.2 million and $7.1 million, respectively, and resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets by generally the same amounts. Our consolidated statements of cash flows reflect, for the fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, excess tax benefits of $22.1 million, $14.6 million and $15.4 million, respectively, from employee exercises of stock options as financing cash flows. As of September 30, 2015, we had $10.1 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock option awards that is expected to be charged to expense over the weighted average period of 2.2 years, and $4.8 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock awards that is expected to be charged to expense over the weighted average period of 2.8 years. Non-recurring Items For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, cost of products sold and distribution expenses reflect 1.2 million ($1.4 million, at the weighted average exchange rate during the relevant period) and selling, general and administrative expenses reflect 3.5 million ($3.9 million, at the weighted average exchange rate during the relevant period) in expenses related to the Germany restructuring, based on the nature of the costs incurred. At September 30, 2015, the Company believes that any future costs of the Germany restructuring, primarily relating to remaining obligations under operating leases, will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's future operating results or cash flows. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, selling, general and administrative expenses also reflect expenses of $5.6 million (net of related insurance recovery of $0.6 million) and $2.5 million, respectively, consisting of costs related to the data security incidents. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, these amounts include an accrued liability related to potential litigation costs and expenses associated with the 2014 data security incident of approximately $2.9 million. In addition, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, selling, general and administrative expenses reflect expense of $3.5 million for a share-based compensation award in connection with the executive management transition plan disclosed in May 2014. 48 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table shows the condensed results of operations of our business for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015 2014 2013 Net sales $ 3,834.4 $ 3,753.5 $ 3,622.2 Cost of products sold and distribution expenses 1,936.5 1,893.3 1,826.9 Gross profit 1,897.9 1,860.2 1,795.3 Total other operating costs and expenses 1,402.6 1,353.2 1,274.9 Operating earnings 495.3 507.0 520.4 Interest expense 116.8 116.3 107.7 Earnings before provision for income taxes 378.5 390.7 412.7 Provision for income taxes 143.4 144.7 151.5 Net earnings $ 235.1 $ 246.0 $ 261.2 The following table shows the condensed results of operations of our business for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, expressed as a percentage of net sales for each respective period: Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015 2014 2013 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of products sold and distribution expenses 50.5 % 50.4 % 50.4 % Gross profit 49.5 % 49.6 % 49.6 % Total other operating costs and expenses 36.6 % 36.1 % 35.2 % Operating earnings 12.9 % 13.5 % 14.4 % Interest expense 3.0 % 3.1 % 3.0 % Earnings before provision for income taxes 9.9 % 10.4 % 11.4 % Provision for income taxes 3.8 % 3.8 % 4.2 % Net earnings 6.1 % 6.6 % 7.2 % 49 Table of Contents Key Operating Metrics The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information concerning key measures we rely on to gauge our operating performance (dollars in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015 2014 2013 Net sales: Sally Beauty Supply $ 2,329,523 $ 2,308,743 $ 2,230,028 BSG 1,504,820 1,444,755 1,392,188 Consolidated $ 3,834,343 $ 3,753,498 $ 3,622,216 Gross profit $ 1,897,851 $ 1,860,172 $ 1,795,263 Gross profit margin 49.5 % 49.6 % 49.6 % Selling, general and administrative expenses(b)(c) $ 1,313,134 $ 1,273,513 $ 1,202,709 Depreciation and amortization $ 89,391 $ 79,663 $ 72,192 Earnings before provision for income taxes: Segment operating profit: Sally Beauty Supply(a) $ 412,393 $ 431,655 $ 437,018 BSG 231,151 216,971 200,492 Segment operating profit 643,544 648,626 637,510 Unallocated expenses(b) (131,440 ) (119,523 ) (97,947 ) Share-based compensation expenses(c) (16,778 ) (22,107 ) (19,201 ) Operating earnings 495,326 506,996 520,362 Interest expense (116,842 ) (116,317 ) (107,695 ) Earnings before provision for income taxes $ 378,484 $ 390,679 $ 412,667 Segment operating profit margin: Sally Beauty Supply 17.7 % 18.7 % 19.6 % BSG 15.4 % 15.0 % 14.4 % Consolidated operating profit margin 12.9 % 13.5 % 14.4 % Number of stores at end-of-period (including franchises): Sally Beauty Supply 3,673 3,563 3,424 BSG 1,294 1,265 1,245 Consolidated 4,967 4,828 4,669 Same store sales growth (decline)(d) Sally Beauty Supply 1.7 % 1.3 % (0.6 )% BSG 5.7 % 3.5 % 4.2 % Consolidated 2.9 % 2.0 % 0.8 % (a) For the fiscal year 2015, Sally Beauty Supply's operating profit reflects $5.3 million in expenses related to the restructuring of its operations in Germany.

(d) For the purpose of calculating our same store sales metrics, we compare the current period sales for stores open for 14 months or longer as of the last day of a month with the sales for these stores for the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. Our same store sales are calculated in constant dollars and include internet-based sales (including the BSG Loxa Beauty website) and the effect of store expansions, if applicable, but do not generally include the sales from stores relocated until 14 months after the relocation. The sales from stores acquired are excluded from our same store sales calculation until 14 months after the acquisition. Description of Net Sales and Expenses Net Sales. Our net sales consist primarily of the following: Sally Beauty Supply. Sally Beauty Supply generates net sales primarily by selling products through its stores to both retail customers and salon professionals. Sally Beauty Supply sells products for hair color and care, skin and nail care, beauty sundries and electrical appliances. Because approximately 47% of our Sally Beauty Supply product sales come from exclusive-label brands, most of these same products are generally not available in most other retail stores or in our BSG business segment. Various factors influence Sally Beauty Supply's net sales including overall consumer traffic, local competition, inclement weather, product assortment and availability, price, hours of operation, and marketing and promotional activity. Sally Beauty Supply's product assortment and sales are generally not seasonal in nature. Beauty Systems Group. BSG generates net sales primarily by selling products to salons and salon professionals through company-operated and franchised stores as well as through its network of professional distributor sales consultants. BSG sells products for hair color and care, skin and nail care, beauty sundries and electrical appliances. These products are not sold directly to the general public and are generally not the same products as those sold in our Sally Beauty Supply stores. Various factors influence BSG's net sales, including product features and availability, competition, inclement weather, relationships with suppliers, new product introductions and price. BSG's product assortment and sales are generally not seasonal in nature. Cost of Products Sold and Distribution Expenses. We do not manufacture the products we sell, and instead purchase these products from recognized brand manufacturers and private label fillers. Cost of products sold and distribution expenses consist of the cost to purchase merchandise from these suppliers, as well as certain overhead expenses including procurement costs, freight from distribution centers to stores and merchandise handling costs at the distribution centers. Cost of products sold and distribution expenses are reduced by vendor rebates and allowances earned and include inventory shrinkage expense, which represents product that is lost, stolen or damaged primarily while in the stores. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation (including share-based compensation expenses), commissions paid to professional distributor sales consultants, employee benefits, rent, utilities, property maintenance, advertising costs, freight and distribution expenses for delivery to customers, credit card fees, insurance, corporate and shared costs, and other administrative costs and expenses. 51 Table of Contents Interest Expense. Interest expense includes the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and is stated net of interest income.

Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015 2014 Increase (Decrease) Net sales: Sally Beauty Supply $ 2,329,523 $ 2,308,743 $ 20,780 0.9 % BSG 1,504,820 1,444,755 60,065 4.2 % Consolidated net sales $ 3,834,343 $ 3,753,498 $ 80,845 2.2 % Gross profit: Sally Beauty Supply $ 1,276,529 $ 1,265,785 $ 10,744 0.8 % BSG 621,322 594,387 26,935 4.5 % Consolidated gross profit $ 1,897,851 $ 1,860,172 $ 37,679 2.0 % Gross profit margin: Sally Beauty Supply 54.8 % 54.8 % 0.0 % BSG 41.3 % 41.1 % 0.2 % Consolidated gross profit margin 49.5 % 49.6 % (0.1 )% Net Sales Consolidated Net Sales. Consolidated net sales increased by $80.8 million, or 2.2%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Company-operated Sally Beauty Supply and BSG stores that have been open for 14 months or longer contributed an increase in consolidated net sales of approximately $98.7 million, or 2.6% of consolidated net sales. Other sales channels (including sales from stores that have been open for less than 14 months, incremental sales from businesses acquired in the preceding 12 months, sales through our BSG franchise-based businesses and distributor sales consultants, and sales from our Sally Beauty Supply non-store sales channels) in the aggregate experienced a net decrease in sales of approximately $17.9 million, or 0.5% of consolidated net sales, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, primarily due to fewer acquisitions and store openings, and softer Sally Beauty Supply non-store sales. Consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, are inclusive of a net negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $87.3 million, or 2.3% of consolidated net sales. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, consolidated net sales reflect a same store sales growth rate of 2.9% compared to 2.0% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, our consolidated same store sales growth rate was positively impacted by improved customer traffic in our BSG segment in the U.S. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, the consolidated same store sales growth rate was negatively impacted by lower traffic in both operating segments driven primarily by inclement weather in the U.S. The $80.8 million increase in consolidated net sales is primarily the result of increases in unit volume (including increases in sales at existing stores and the incremental sales from 145 company-operated stores opened or acquired during the last twelve months) and average unit prices (resulting from changes in product mix, including the impact on average unit prices of third-party brands introduced this year at both segments). 52 Table of Contents Sally Beauty Supply. Net sales for Sally Beauty Supply increased by $20.8 million, or 0.9% of segment net sales, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. In the Sally Beauty Supply segment, company-operated stores that have been open for 14 months or longer contributed an increase in segment net sales of approximately $30.0 million, or 1.3% of segment net sales. Other sales channels (including sales from stores that have been open for less than 14 months and sales from our non-store sales channels, which include the catalog and e-commerce sales of our Sinelco Group subsidiaries) in the aggregate experienced a net decrease in sales of approximately $9.2 million, or 0.4% of segment net sales, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, primarily due to fewer Sally Beauty Supply store openings and softer non-store sales. Net sales for Sally Beauty Supply for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, are inclusive of a net negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $70.9 million, or 3.1% of Sally Beauty Supply's net sales. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, the Sally Beauty Supply segment's net sales reflect a same store sales growth rate of 1.7% compared to 1.3% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, the Sally Beauty Supply segment's same store sales growth rate was positively impacted by higher average sales transaction amounts at our U.S. stores compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, the segment's same store sales growth rate was adversely impacted by lower traffic driven primarily by inclement weather in the U.S. The $20.8 million increase in the Sally Beauty Supply segment's net sales is the result of increases in unit volume (including increases in sales at existing stores and the incremental sales from 111 company-operated stores opened during the last twelve months) and average unit prices (resulting from changes in product mix, including the impact on average unit prices of third-party brands introduced this year at our Sally Beauty Supply segment). Beauty Systems Group. Net sales for BSG increased by $60.1 million, or 4.2% of segment net sales, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. In the BSG segment, company-operated stores that have been open for 14 months or longer contributed an increase in segment net sales of approximately $68.7 million, or 4.8% of segment net sales, and sales through our distributor sales consultants contributed an increase in segment net sales of approximately $9.1 million, or 0.6%, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, while sales from stores that have been open for less than 14 months experienced a decrease of $11.0 million, or 0.8% of segment net sales, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, primarily due to a shift in the timing of store openings in the normal course of BSG's business. Other sales channels (including sales through our franchise-based businesses and incremental sales from businesses acquired in the preceding 12 months) in the aggregate experienced a net decrease in sales of approximately $6.7 million, or 0.5% of segment net sales, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, primarily due to fewer acquisitions. Net sales for BSG for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, are inclusive of a net negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $16.5 million, or 1.1% of BSG's net sales. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, the BSG segment's net sales reflect a same store sales growth rate of 5.7% compared to 3.5% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, the BSG segment's same store sales growth rate was positively impacted by improved customer traffic in the U.S. compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. The $60.1 million increase in the BSG segment's net sales is primarily the result of increases in unit volume (including increases in sales at existing stores and the incremental sales from 34 company-operated stores opened or acquired during the last twelve months) and average unit prices (resulting from changes in product mix, including the impact of certain third-party brands with higher average unit prices introduced this year at our BSG segment). 53 Table of Contents Gross Profit Consolidated Gross Profit. Consolidated gross profit increased by $37.7 million, or 2.0%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, primarily due to higher net sales. Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or consolidated gross profit margin, was 49.5% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to 49.6% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Consolidated gross profit for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 is inclusive of a negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $40.6 million. Sally Beauty Supply. Sally Beauty Supply's gross profit increased by $10.7 million, or 0.8%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, primarily due to higher sales. Sally Beauty Supply's gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 54.8% for both the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Sally Beauty Supply's gross profit for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 is inclusive of a negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $33.4 million. Beauty Systems Group. BSG's gross profit increased by $26.9 million, or 4.5%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, due to higher sales and improved gross profit margin. BSG's gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 41.3% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to 41.1% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. BSG's gross profit for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 is inclusive of a negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $7.2 million. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $39.6 million, or 3.1%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. This increase was attributable in part to incremental expenses (including employee compensation, rent and other occupancy-related expenses) resulting from stores opened in the preceding 12 months (approximately 145 net additional company-operated stores added since September 30, 2014, which represents a 3.1% increase in the number of stores). In addition, the increase reflects higher recruitment and compensation-related expenses primarily in connection with our ongoing management transition plans (approximately $5.0 million), higher expenses related to on-going upgrades to our information technology systems (approximately $3.7 million), higher advertising costs in our Sally Beauty Supply segment (approximately $5.4 million) and higher expenses principally associated with store remodels and relocations (approximately $2.4 million) in the Sally Beauty Supply segment, higher corporate expenses related to the data security incidents and to ongoing data security upgrades (approximately $4.0 million, net of related insurance recovery), and expenses incurred in connection with the restructuring of our Sally Beauty Supply segment's operations in Germany of approximately $3.9 million ($5.3 million, net of approximately $1.4 million reflected in cost of products sold and distribution expenses) in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 34.2% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to 33.9% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, mainly as a result of the expense increases mentioned earlier in this paragraph. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 are inclusive of a net positive impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, of approximately $34.2 million, resulting from a stronger U.S. dollar during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Depreciation and Amortization Consolidated depreciation and amortization increased by $9.7 million, or 12.2%, to $89.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to $79.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. This increase reflects the incremental depreciation and amortization expenses associated with capital expenditures made in the preceding 12 months (mainly in connection with store openings in both operating 54 Table of Contents segments, store remodels in the Sally Beauty Supply segment in the U.S., and ongoing information technology upgrades), partially offset by the impact of assets (including intangible assets) that became fully depreciated (or fully amortized) in the preceding 12 months. Operating Earnings The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information concerning our operating earnings for each reportable segment (dollars in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015 2014 Increase (Decrease) Operating Earnings: Segment operating profit: Sally Beauty Supply $ 412,393 $ 431,655 $ (19,262 ) (4.5)% BSG 231,151 216,971 14,180 6.5% Segment operating profit 643,544 648,626 (5,082 ) (0.8)% Unallocated expenses (131,440 ) (119,523 ) 11,917 10.0% Share-based compensation expenses (16,778 ) (22,107 ) (5,329 ) (24.1)% Operating earnings $ 495,326 $ 506,996 $ (11,670 ) (2.3)% Consolidated operating earnings decreased by $11.7 million, or 2.3%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. This decrease is primarily the result of higher unallocated expenses and a decrease in our Sally Beauty Supply segment's operating profit, partially offset by an increase in our BSG segment's operating profit and lower share-based compensation expenses, as discussed below. Operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 12.9% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to 13.5% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. This decrease reflects higher consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales, including incremental corporate expenses related primarily to the data security incidents and ongoing data security upgrades of approximately $4.0 million (net of certain insurance recovery related to the data security incidents) and expenses of $5.3 million related to the Sally Beauty Supply segment's Germany restructuring mentioned earlier. Sally Beauty Supply. Sally Beauty Supply's segment operating earnings decreased by $19.3 million, or 4.5%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. The decrease in the Sally Beauty Supply segment's operating earnings was primarily a result of the incremental costs related to 111 additional company-operated stores (stores opened during the past twelve months) operating during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. In addition, the decrease reflects higher advertising costs ($5.4 million), the incremental depreciation expense ($4.8 million) associated with capital expenditures made in the preceding 12 months (mainly in connection with store openings in several geographies and store remodels in the U.S., and with ongoing information technology upgrades), expenses related to the Germany restructuring initiative ($5.3 million), higher expenses principally associated with store remodels and relocations ($2.4 million) and higher recruitment and employee compensation-related expenses in connection with our management transition plans ($1.4 million), partially offset by the increase in the Sally Beauty Supply segment's net sales described above. Segment operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 17.7% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to 18.7% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. This decrease reflects higher segment operating expenses as a percentage of the segment's net sales, primarily as a result of the expense increases mentioned earlier in this paragraph. 55 Table of Contents Beauty Systems Group. BSG's segment operating earnings increased by $14.2 million, or 6.5%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, primarily as a result of increased sales, partially offset by the incremental costs related to 34 additional company-operated stores (stores opened during the past twelve months) operating during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, as well as by the incremental depreciation expense ($1.9 million) associated with capital expenditures made in the preceding 12 months (mainly in connection with ongoing information technology upgrades), higher allowance for doubtful accounts receivable (approximately $0.8 million, predominantly related to one customer) and higher expenses related primarily to upgrades to our BSG information technology systems (approximately $0.7 million). Segment operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 15.4% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to 15.0% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in the segment's gross profit margin described above, as well as a reduction in the segment's operating expenses as a percentage of the segment's net sales. Unallocated Expenses. Unallocated expenses, which represent certain corporate costs (such as payroll, employee benefits and travel expenses for corporate staff, certain professional fees, certain new business development expenses and corporate governance expenses) that have not been charged to our operating segments, increased by $11.9 million, or 10.0%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. This increase was due primarily to higher recruitment and employee compensation-related expenses primarily in connection with our ongoing management transition plans (approximately $3.2 million), incremental depreciation expense ($3.3 million) associated with capital expenditures made in the preceding 12 months (mainly in connection with ongoing information technology upgrades), higher corporate expenses related primarily to on-going upgrades to our information technology systems (approximately $2.5 million), higher corporate expenses related primarily to the data security incidents and ongoing data security upgrades (approximately $4.0 million, net of certain insurance recovery related to the data security incidents) and higher professional fees primarily related to new business development and other corporate initiatives (approximately $1.0 million). Share-based Compensation Expenses. Total compensation costs charged against income for share-based compensation arrangements decreased by $5.3 million, or 24.1%, to $16.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to $22.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. This decrease was mainly due to lower aggregate fair value at the date of grant of the stock options awarded during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 and the impact of awards that became fully vested since September 30, 2014. In addition, this decrease reflects the impact of a $3.5 million stock options award in connection with the executive management transition plan during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, without a comparable award in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Interest Expense Interest expense was $116.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to $116.3 million the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Interest expense is net of interest income of approximately $0.2 million for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the effect of higher principal balances on our debt outstanding during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, including the senior notes due 2023 issued in October 2013. This increase was partially offset by lower borrowings under the ABL facility during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Please see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" contained elsewhere in this Annual Report and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for additional information about the Company's debt. 56 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $143.4 million and $144.7 million and the annual effective tax rate was 37.9% and 37.0% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the effective income tax rate for the fiscal year 2015, compared to the fiscal year 2014, is primarily due to increased foreign tax losses resulting in part from our ongoing expansion into international geographies and a beneficial tax settlement in the fiscal year 2014 without a comparable tax benefit in the fiscal year 2015. Net Earnings As a result of the foregoing, consolidated net earnings decreased by $10.9 million, or 4.4%, to $235.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to $246.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Net earnings, as a percentage of net sales, were 6.1% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to 6.6% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. The Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2014 compared to the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2013 The table below presents net sales, gross profit and gross profit margin data for each reportable segment (dollars in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2014 2013 Increase (Decrease) Net sales: Sally Beauty Supply $ 2,308,743 $ 2,230,028 $ 78,715 3.5 % BSG 1,444,755 1,392,188 52,567 3.8 % Consolidated net sales $ 3,753,498 $ 3,622,216 $ 131,282 3.6 % Gross profit: Sally Beauty Supply $ 1,265,785 $ 1,223,378 $ 42,407 3.5 % BSG 594,387 571,885 22,502 3.9 % Consolidated gross profit $ 1,860,172 $ 1,795,263 $ 64,909 3.6 % Gross profit margin: Sally Beauty Supply 54.8 % 54.9 % (0.1 )% BSG 41.1 % 41.1 % 0.0 % Consolidated gross profit margin 49.6 % 49.6 % 0.0 % Net Sales Consolidated Net Sales. Consolidated net sales increased by $131.3 million, or 3.6%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Company-operated Sally Beauty Supply and BSG stores that have been open for 14 months or longer contributed an increase in consolidated net sales of approximately $120.2 million, or 3.3%. Other sales channels (including sales from stores that have been open for less than 14 months, incremental sales from businesses acquired in the preceding 12 months, sales through our BSG franchise-based businesses and distributor sales consultants, and sales from our Sally Beauty Supply non-store sales channels) in the aggregate contributed a net increase in sales of approximately $11.1 million, or 0.3%, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our consolidated net sales. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, consolidated net sales reflect a 2.0% same store sales growth rate compared to a same store sales growth rate of 0.8% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. For 57 Table of Contents the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, the consolidated same store sales growth rate was negatively impacted by lower traffic in the U.S. primarily driven by inclement weather that resulted in 6,157 store-closure days in the first six months of fiscal year 2014, compared to 1,906 in the prior year comparable period. However, the negative impact on consolidated same store sales resulting from inclement weather in the first six months of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 was offset by an improvement in same store sales in the second half of the fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, the consolidated same store sales growth rate was adversely impacted by lower non-Beauty Club Card traffic in the U.S. and a difficult comparison against strong growth in the prior year in certain of the Sally Beauty Supply segment's product categories (such as nail care and certain hair product lines). The $131.3 million increase in consolidated net sales is the result of increases in both unit volume (including increases in sales at existing stores and the incremental sales from 160 company-operated stores opened or acquired during the last twelve months) and average unit prices (resulting from changes in product mix), including the impact on average unit prices of third-party brands introduced recently at our Sally Beauty Supply segment. Sally Beauty Supply. Net sales for Sally Beauty Supply increased by $78.7 million, or 3.5%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. In the Sally Beauty Supply segment, company-operated stores that have been open for 14 months or longer contributed an increase in segment net sales of approximately $80.7 million, or 3.6%. Certain other sales channels (including sales from stores that have been open for less than 14 months and sales from our non-store sales channels, which include the catalog and e-commerce sales of our Sinelco Group subsidiaries) in the aggregate contributed an increase in sales of approximately $3.3 million, or 0.1%, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. On the other hand, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, incremental sales from businesses acquired in the preceding 12 months were $5.3 million with no comparable amount for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Net sales for Sally Beauty Supply for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, are inclusive of a positive impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $11.8 million. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, the Sally Beauty Supply segment's net sales reflect a 1.3% same store sales growth rate compared to a 0.6% negative growth rate for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, the Sally Beauty Supply segment's same store sales growth rate was negatively impacted by lower traffic in the U.S. driven primarily by inclement weather that resulted in 4,884 store closure days in the first six months of the fiscal year 2014, compared to 1,369 in the prior year comparable period. However, the negative impact on the Sally Beauty Supply segment's same store sales resulting from inclement weather in the first six months of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 was offset by an improvement in same store sales in the second half of the fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, the segment's negative same store sales growth rate was adversely impacted by lower non-Beauty Club Card traffic in the U.S. and a difficult comparison against strong growth in the prior year in certain of the Sally Beauty Supply segment's product categories, as discussed earlier. The $78.7 million increase in the Sally Beauty Supply segment's net sales is the result of increases in both unit volume (including increases in sales at existing stores and the incremental sales from 141 company-operated stores opened during the last twelve months) and average unit prices (resulting from changes in product mix), including the impact on average unit prices of certain third-party brands introduced recently. Beauty Systems Group. Net sales for BSG increased by $52.6 million, or 3.8%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. In the BSG segment, company-operated stores that have been open for 14 months or longer contributed an increase in segment net sales of approximately $39.4 million, or 2.8%. In addition, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, incremental sales from businesses acquired in the preceding 12 months were $6.4 million, or 0.5%, higher for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Other 58 Table of Contents sales channels (including sales from stores that have been open for less than 14 months, sales through our distributor sales consultants and sales through our franchise-based businesses) in the aggregate contributed a net increase in sales of approximately $6.8 million, or 0.5%, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Net sales for BSG for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, are inclusive of a negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $6.7 million. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, the BSG segment's net sales reflect a 3.5% same store sales growth rate compared to 4.2% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, the BSG segment's same store sales growth rate was negatively impacted by lower traffic in the U.S. driven primarily by inclement weather that resulted in 1,273 store closure days in the first six months of the fiscal year 2014, compared to 537 in the prior year comparable period. The $52.6 million increase in the BSG segment's net sales is primarily the result of increases in unit volume (including increases in sales at existing stores and the incremental sales from 19 company-operated stores opened or acquired during the last twelve months). Gross Profit Consolidated Gross Profit. Consolidated gross profit increased by $64.9 million, or 3.6%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, due to higher sales. Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or consolidated gross profit margin, was 49.6% for both the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our consolidated gross profit. Sally Beauty Supply. Sally Beauty Supply's gross profit increased by $42.4 million, or 3.5%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, due to higher sales. Sally Beauty Supply's gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 54.8% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to 54.9% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. The decline in gross profit margin was primarily the result of a shift in product mix (to lower margin product) in the U.S., including the impact of increases in sales of third-party brands, which generally have a lower gross profit margin for us than exclusive-label products. Beauty Systems Group. BSG's gross profit increased by $22.5 million, or 3.9%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, due to higher sales. BSG's gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 41.1% for both the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $70.8 million, or 5.9%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. This increase was attributable to incremental expenses (including employee compensation, rent and other occupancy-related expenses) resulting from stores opened and from businesses acquired in the preceding 12 months (160 additional company-operated stores added since September 30, 2013, a 3.6% increase), higher corporate expenses associated with our self-funded employee healthcare benefits program in the U.S. (approximately $11.4 million), higher advertising costs in the Sally Beauty Supply segment of $6.3 million, higher corporate expenses related primarily to on-going upgrades to our information technology systems (approximately $3.3 million) and an increase in our investments in new business development primarily at BSG's Loxa Beauty business (approximately $2.5 million). In addition, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, selling, general and administrative expenses reflect the charge of $2.5 million in connection with the data security incident and the $3.5 million share-based compensation expense in connection with the executive management transition plan mentioned earlier without a comparable amount for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a 59 Table of Contents percentage of net sales, increased to 33.9% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to 33.2% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, mainly as a result of the expense increases and the charges mentioned earlier in this paragraph. Depreciation and Amortization Consolidated depreciation and amortization was $79.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to $72.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. This increase reflects the incremental depreciation and amortization expenses associated with businesses acquired in the preceding 12 months and with capital expenditures made in that period (mainly in connection with store openings in both operating segments and with ongoing information technology upgrades), partially offset by the impact of assets that became fully depreciated in the preceding 12 months. Operating Earnings The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information concerning our operating earnings for each reportable segment (dollars in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2014 2013 Increase (Decrease) Operating Earnings: Segment operating profit: Sally Beauty Supply $ 431,655 $ 437,018 $ (5,363 ) (1.2) % BSG 216,971 200,492 16,479 8.2 % Segment operating profit 648,626 637,510 11,116 1.7 % Unallocated expenses (119,523 ) (97,947 ) 21,576 22.0 % Share-based compensation expenses (22,107 ) (19,201 ) 2,906 15.1 % Operating earnings $ 506,996 $ 520,362 $ (13,366 ) (2.6) % Consolidated operating earnings decreased by $13.4 million, or 2.6%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. The decrease in consolidated operating earnings is primarily the result of higher unallocated expenses and share-based compensation expenses and a decrease in the Sally Beauty Supply segment's operating profit, partially offset by an increase in the BSG segment's operating profit, as discussed below. Operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 13.5% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to 14.4% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. This decrease reflects higher consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales, including the $2.5 million charge in connection with the data security incident and the $3.5 million share-based compensation expense in connection with the executive management transition plan mentioned earlier. Sally Beauty Supply. Sally Beauty Supply's segment operating earnings decreased by $5.4 million, or 1.2%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. The decrease in the Sally Beauty Supply segment's operating earnings was primarily a result of the incremental costs related to 141 additional company-operated stores (stores opened during the past twelve months) operating during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, the incremental depreciation expense (approximately $3.8 million) associated with capital expenditures made in the preceding 12 months (mainly in connection with store openings and ongoing information technology upgrades), higher legal and professional fees of approximately $3.2 million and higher advertising costs of $6.3 million, partially offset by the increase in the Sally Beauty Supply segment's sales volume described above. Segment operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 18.7% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, 60 Table of Contents compared to 19.6% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. This decrease reflects higher segment operating expenses as a percentage of the segment's net sales primarily as a result of the expense increases mentioned earlier in this paragraph. Beauty Systems Group. BSG's segment operating earnings increased by $16.5 million, or 8.2%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, primarily as a result of increased sales, partially offset by the incremental costs related to 19 additional company-operated stores (stores opened or acquired during the past twelve months) operating during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 and investments in new business development (approximately $2.5 million). Segment operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 15.0% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to 14.4% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, primarily as a result of a reduction in the segment's operating expenses as a percentage of the segment's net sales. Unallocated Expenses. Unallocated expenses, which represent certain corporate costs (such as payroll, employee benefits and travel expenses for corporate staff, certain professional fees, certain new business development expenses and corporate governance expenses) that have not been charged to our operating segments, increased by $21.6 million, or 22.0%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. This increase was due primarily to higher corporate expenses associated with our self-funded employee healthcare benefits program in the U.S. (approximately $11.4 million) and related to on-going upgrades to our information technology systems (approximately $3.3 million). In addition, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, unallocated expenses reflect the charge of $2.5 million in connection with the data security incident without a comparable amount for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Share-based Compensation Expenses. Total compensation costs charged against income for share-based compensation arrangements increased by $2.9 million, or 15.1%, to $22.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to $19.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. This increase was primarily due to the impact of share-based awards made during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, including the $3.5 million share-based compensation expense in connection with the executive management transition plan described above, partially offset by the impact of share-based compensation awards that became fully vested during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Interest Expense Interest expense increased by $8.6 million, to $116.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Interest expense is net of interest income of approximately $0.2 million for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the effect of higher principal balances on our debt outstanding during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, including the senior notes due 2023 issued in October 2013. Please see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" contained elsewhere in this Annual Report and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for additional information about the Company's debt. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $144.7 million and $151.5 million and the annual effective tax rate was 37.0% and 36.7% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Net Earnings As a result of the foregoing, consolidated net earnings decreased by $15.2 million, or 5.8%, to $246.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to $261.2 million for the fiscal year 61 Table of Contents ended September 30, 2013. Net earnings, as a percentage of net sales, were 6.6% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to 7.2% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Financial Condition September 30, 2015 Compared to September 30, 2014 Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) increased by $54.8 million to $695.4 million at September 30, 2015, compared to $640.6 million at September 30, 2014. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.41 to 1.00 at September 30, 2015, compared to 2.38 to 1.00 at September 30, 2014. The increase in working capital reflects an increase in current assets of $83.0 million, partially offset by an increase in current liabilities of $28.2 million. The increase in current assets is principally due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $33.5 million (please see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for a description of our sources and uses of cash) and an increase of $56.8 million in inventory, partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts receivable and accounts receivable, other, in the aggregate, of $7.4 million. The increase in current liabilities is principally due to an increase of $16.5 million in accounts payable and an increase of $9.9 million in accrued liabilities, as discussed below. Trade accounts receivable and accounts receivable, other, in the aggregate, decreased by $7.4 million to $91.1 million at September 30, 2015, compared to $98.5 million at September 30, 2014 due primarily to the timing of collections from customers and vendors in the ordinary course of our business and the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments. Inventory increased by $56.8 million to $885.2 million at September 30, 2015, compared to $828.4 million at September 30, 2014 primarily due to the effect of stores opened (145 net additional Sally Beauty Supply and BSG company-operated stores added during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015), the addition of new product lines in both operating segments and the expansion of our BSG segment's exclusive distribution rights into new geographic areas in the U.S., partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments of approximately $23.9 million. Accounts payable increased by $16.5 million to $275.9 million at September 30, 2015, compared to $259.5 million at September 30, 2014 due to the timing of payments to suppliers primarily in connection with recent purchases of merchandise inventory and capital expenditures. Accrued liabilities increased by $9.9 million to $208.7 million at September 30, 2015, compared to $198.8 million at September 30, 2014, primarily due to the timing of payments of employee compensation and compensation-related expenses of $5.2 million and an accrued liability related to the 2014 data security incident of approximately $2.9 million. Net property and equipment increased by $32.7 million to $270.8 million at September 30, 2015, compared to $238.1 million at September 30, 2014, primarily due to capital expenditures, including amounts incurred but not paid at September 30, 2015, of $118.1 million, partially offset by the fiscal year 2015 depreciation expense of $75.1 million and foreign currency translation adjustments of approximately $9.3 million. Goodwill decreased by $12.0 million to $524.4 million at September 30, 2015, compared to $536.3 million at September 30, 2014, primarily due to foreign currency translation adjustments of approximately $14.8 million, partially offset by goodwill recorded in connection with businesses acquired during the fiscal year 2015 of $2.8 million. Intangible assets, excluding goodwill, decreased by $15.9 million to $98.8 million at September 30, 2015, compared to $114.7 million at September 30, 2014, primarily due to amortization expense of $14.3 million recognized in the fiscal year 2015 and foreign currency translation adjustments, partially offset by intangible assets recorded in connection with businesses acquired during the fiscal year 2015 of $2.2 million. Long-term debt, including current portion, increased by $1.6 million to $1,787.6 million at September 30, 2015, compared to $1,786.0 million at September 30, 2014, primarily due to foreign currency translation 62 Table of Contents adjustments and the amortization of premium on certain senior notes. Please see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. Total stockholders' deficit decreased by $49.2 million to $297.8 million at September 30, 2015, compared to $347.1 million at September 30, 2014. This decrease was primarily a result of net earnings of $235.1 million, and share-based compensation expenses, the impact of exercises of stock options and other share-based compensation activity, in the aggregate, of approximately $90.9 million. This decrease was partially offset by our repurchase and retirement of approximately 8.1 million shares of our common stock for approximately $227.6 million and foreign currency translation adjustments, net of tax, of $49.2 million. Please see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. Liquidity and Capital Resources We broadly define liquidity as our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments. In addition, liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate debt and equity financing and to convert into cash those assets that are no longer required to meet existing strategic and financial objectives. Therefore, liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current or potentially available funds for use in achieving long-range business objectives and meeting debt service commitments. We are highly leveraged and a substantial portion of our liquidity needs will arise from debt service on our outstanding indebtedness and from funding the costs of operations, working capital, capital expenditures and share repurchases. As a holding company, we depend on our subsidiaries, including Sally Holdings LLC (which we refer to as "Sally Holdings"), to distribute funds to us so that we may pay our obligations and expenses. The ability of our subsidiaries to make such distributions will be subject to their operating results, cash requirements and financial condition and their compliance with relevant laws, and covenants and financial ratios related to their existing or future indebtedness, including covenants restricting Sally Holdings' ability to pay dividends to us. If, as a consequence of these limitations, we cannot receive sufficient distributions from our subsidiaries, we may not be able to meet our obligations to fund general corporate expenses. Please see "Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business," and " Risks Relating to Our Substantial Indebtedness." We may from time to time repurchase or otherwise retire or refinance our debt (through our subsidiaries or otherwise) and take other steps to reduce or refinance our debt. These actions may include open market repurchases of our notes or other retirements of outstanding debt. The amount of debt that may be repurchased, or refinanced or otherwise retired, if any, will be determined in the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on market conditions, trading levels of the Company's debt from time to time, the Company's cash position and other considerations. At September 30, 2015, cash and cash equivalents were $140.0 million. Based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth, we anticipate that existing cash balances, funds expected to be generated by operations and funds available under the ABL facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, fund share repurchases and potential acquisitions, and finance anticipated capital expenditures, including information technology upgrades and store remodels, over the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that anticipated net sales and operating improvements will be realized, or that future borrowings will be available under our ABL facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, our ability to meet our debt service obligations and liquidity needs are subject to certain risks, which include, but are not limited to, increases in competitive activity, the loss of key suppliers, rising interest rates, the loss of key personnel, the ability to execute our business strategy, general economic conditions and other risks discussed in this Annual Report. Please see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Annual Report. 63 Table of Contents We utilize our ABL facility for the issuance of letters of credit, for certain working capital and liquidity needs and to manage normal fluctuations in our operational cash flow. In that regard, we may from time to time draw funds under the ABL facility for general corporate purposes including funding of capital expenditures, acquisitions, interest payments due on our indebtedness and share repurchases. There were no funds drawn or borrowings outstanding during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 under the ABL facility. As of September 30, 2015, there were no borrowings outstanding under the ABL facility and Sally Holdings had $476.9 million available for borrowings under the ABL facility, subject to borrowing base limitations, as reduced by outstanding letters of credit. We are a holding company and do not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of equity interests in our subsidiaries. The agreements and instruments governing the debt of Sally Holdings and its subsidiaries contain material limitations on their ability to pay dividends and other restricted payments to us which, in turn, constitute material limitations on our ability to pay dividends and other payments to our stockholders. Please see " Long-Term Debt Covenants " below. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we completed several acquisitions at an aggregate cost of $7.1 million, $4.9 million and $22.1 million, respectively. We generally funded these acquisitions with cash from operations, borrowings under the ABL facility and a portion of the cash proceeds from our September 2012 and October 2013 debt issuances. Share Repurchase Programs In August 2014, we announced that the Board had approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock over a period of approximately three years (the "2014 Share Repurchase Program"). The 2014 Share Repurchase Program expires on September 30, 2017. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 8.1 million shares of our common stock under the 2014 Share Repurchase Program at a cost of $227.6 million. In addition, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we repurchased and retired approximately 12.6 million shares of our common stock under the 2013 Share Repurchase Program (a share repurchase program approved by our Board in March 2013 and terminated in connection with the authorization of the 2014 Share Repurchase Program) at a cost of $333.3 million and, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 18.9 million shares of our common stock under the 2013 Share Repurchase Program and the 2012 Share Repurchase Program (a share repurchase program approved by our Board in August 2012 and terminated in connection with the authorization of the 2013 Share Repurchase Program) at a cost of $509.7 million. We funded these share repurchases with cash from operations, borrowings under the ABL facility and a portion of the cash proceeds from our September 2012 and October 2013 debt issuances. Future repurchases of shares of our common stock are expected to be funded with existing cash balances, funds expected to be generated by operations and funds available under the ABL facility. Historical Cash Flows For the fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, our primary sources of cash have been funds provided by operating activities, our October 2013 debt issuance and, when necessary, borrowings under our ABL facility. The primary uses of cash during the past three years were for share repurchases, debt service, capital expenditures and acquisitions. 64 Table of Contents The following table shows our sources and uses of funds for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015 2014 Change 2014 2013 Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 300,787 $ 315,972 $ (15,185 ) $ 315,972 $ 310,454 $ 5,518 Net cash used by investing activities (112,818 ) (81,754 ) (31,064 ) (81,754 ) (106,977 ) 25,223 Net cash used by financing activities (151,955 ) (173,734 ) 21,779 (173,734 ) (396,775 ) 223,041 Effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (2,551 ) (1,024 ) (1,527 ) (1,024 ) 193 (1,217 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 33,463 $ 59,460 $ (25,997 ) $ 59,460 $ (193,105 ) $ 252,565 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 decreased by $15.2 million to $300.8 million compared to $316.0 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, primarily due to a decrease in net earnings ($10.9 million) and net changes in the components of working capital in the normal course of our business ($11.4 million), partially offset by a change in depreciation and amortization expense ($9.7 million). The changes in the components of working capital include net changes in operating assets ($49.3 million), partially offset by net changes in operating liabilities ($37.8 million). Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 increased by $5.5 million to $316.0 million compared to $310.5 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. This increase was primarily due to net changes in the components of working capital in the normal course of our business, partially offset by a decrease in net earnings ($15.2 million). Net Cash Used by Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 increased by $31.1 million to $112.8 million compared to $81.8 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. This increase reflects an increase in capital expenditures ($29.7 million) primarily related to store openings and to ongoing information technology upgrades in both business segments, and to store remodels in the Sally Beauty Supply segment in the U.S. during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, as well as an increase in cash used for acquisitions (net of cash acquired) of $1.3 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Net cash used by investing activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 decreased by $25.2 million to $81.8 million, compared to $107.0 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. This decrease reflects, in the Sally Beauty Supply segment, capital expenditures related to our opening of a distribution facility in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 without a comparable capital project in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, as well as lower expenditures in our point-of-sale system upgrade 65 Table of Contents project in the U.S., as we completed that capital project. In addition, the decrease reflects less net cash used for acquisitions (net of cash acquired) of $17.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Net Cash Used by Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities decreased by $21.8 million to $152.0 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to $173.7 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock of $105.7 million, an increase in proceeds from exercises of stock options and excess tax benefits resulting from share-based compensation activity, in the aggregate, of $35.1 million, and the impact of debt issuance costs of $3.9 million paid in connection with issuance of the senior notes due 2023 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 with no comparable amount in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, partially offset by a decrease in net borrowings under our long-term debt of $123.0 million. Net cash used by financing activities decreased by $223.0 million to $173.7 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to $396.8 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. This decrease was primarily due to $176.4 million less cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. In addition, the decrease reflects our issuance of the senior notes due 2023 in October 2013 ($200.0 million), partially offset by our payment in full of borrowings under the ABL facility ($76.0 million) during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, as well as net borrowings of $76.0 million under the ABL facility during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Long-Term Debt Outstanding Long-Term Debt In 2006, the Company, through its subsidiaries (Sally Investment Holdings LLC and Sally Holdings) incurred $1,850.0 million of indebtedness in connection with the Company's separation from its former parent, The Alberto-Culver Company, which we refer to as Alberto-Culver. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, Sally Holdings entered into a $400 million, five-year asset-based senior secured loan facility (the "ABL facility"). The availability of funds under the ABL facility, as amended in June 2012, is subject to a customary borrowing base comprised of: (i) a specified percentage of our eligible credit card and trade accounts receivable (as defined therein) and (ii) a specified percentage of our eligible inventory (as defined therein), and reduced by (iii) certain customary reserves and adjustments and by certain outstanding letters of credit. The ABL facility includes a $25.0 million Canadian sub-facility for our Canadian operations. In July 2013, the Company, Sally Holdings and other parties to the ABL facility entered into a second amendment to the ABL facility which, among other things, increased the maximum availability under the ABL Facility to $500.0 million (subject to borrowing base limitations), reduced pricing, relaxed the restrictions regarding the making of Restricted Payments, extended the maturity to July 2018 and improved certain other covenant terms. At September 30, 2015, the Company had $476.9 million available for borrowing under the ABL facility, including the Canadian sub-facility. In addition, the terms of the ABL facility contain a commitment fee of 0.25% on the unused portion of the facility. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, Sally Holdings and Sally Capital Inc. (collectively, the "Issuers"), both indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of their 6.875% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "senior notes due 2019") and $850.0 million aggregate principal amount of their 5.75% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "senior notes due 2022"), including $150.0 million of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes due 2022 issued at par plus a premium. Such premium is being amortized over the term of the senior notes due 2022 using the effective interest method. The net proceeds from these debt issuances were used to retire outstanding indebtedness 66 Table of Contents in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $1,391.9 million (substantially all of which was incurred in 2006 in connection with our separation from Alberto-Culver) and for general corporate purposes. In connection with the issuances of the senior notes due 2019 and the senior notes due 2022, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 the Company incurred and capitalized, in the aggregate, financing costs of approximately $31.2 million. This amount is included in long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized over the term of the senior notes due 2019 and the senior notes due 2022, as appropriate, using the effective interest method in accordance with GAAP. On October 29, 2013, the Issuers issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of their 5.5% Senior Notes due 2023 (the "senior notes due 2023") at par. The Company used the net proceeds from this debt issuance, approximately $196.3 million, to repay borrowings outstanding under the ABL facility of $88.5 million (which borrowings were primarily used to fund share repurchases) and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. In connection with the issuances of the senior notes due 2023, the Company incurred and capitalized financing costs of approximately $3.9 million. This amount is included in long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized over the term of the senior notes due 2023 using the effective interest method in accordance with GAAP. The principal amount of long-term debt (excluding capitalized leases) as of September 30, 2015 is as follows (dollars in thousands): Principal Amount(c) Maturity Dates Interest Rates(a) ABL facility $ July 2018 (i) Prime plus (0.50% to 0.75%) or; (ii) LIBOR(b) plus (1.50% to 1.75%) Senior notes due 2019 750,000 Nov. 2019 6.875% Senior notes due 2022 850,000 June 2022 5.750% Senior notes due 2023 200,000 Nov. 2023 5.500% Total $ 1,800,000 (a) Interest rates shown represent the coupon or contractual rate related to each debt instrument listed. (b) When used in this Annual Report, LIBOR means the London Interbank Offered Rate. (c) Amounts reported above do not reflect unamortized premium of $6.5 million related to notes with an aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million and unamortized debt issuance costs in the aggregate amount of $21.8 million, at September 30, 2015. Long-Term Debt Covenants We are a holding company and do not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of equity interests in our subsidiaries. The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business. These restrictions and limitations relate to: Incurrence of additional indebtedness Granting of liens on assets Repurchases and redemptions of capital stock and the payment of dividends Making of investments, including joint ventures Making of certain debt prepayments Making of acquisitions Mergers or consolidations Disposition of assets 67 Table of Contents Borrowings under the ABL facility are secured by the accounts, inventory and credit card receivables of our domestic subsidiaries and Canadian subsidiaries (in the case of borrowings under the Canadian sub-facility), together with general intangibles and certain other personal property of our domestic subsidiaries and Canadian subsidiaries (in the case of borrowings under the Canadian sub-facility) relating to the accounts and inventory, as well as deposit accounts of our domestic subsidiaries and Canadian subsidiaries (in the case of borrowings under the Canadian sub-facility) and, solely with respect to borrowings by SBH Finance B.V., intercompany notes owed to SBH Finance B.V. by our foreign subsidiaries. The senior notes due 2019, the senior notes due 2022 and the senior notes due 2023 (which we refer to collectively as "the Notes" or the "senior notes due 2019, 2022 and 2023") are unsecured obligations of the Issuers and are jointly and severally guaranteed by the Company and Sally Investment, and by each material domestic subsidiary of the Company. Interest on the senior notes due 2019, 2022 and 2023 is payable semi-annually, during the Company's first and third fiscal quarters. The ABL facility and the indentures governing the senior notes due 2019, 2022 and 2023 contain other covenants regarding restrictions on assets dispositions, granting of liens and security interests, prepayment of certain indebtedness and other matters and customary events of default, including customary cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions. As of September 30, 2015, all the net assets of our consolidated subsidiaries were unrestricted from transfer under our credit arrangements. The senior notes due 2019 carry optional redemption features whereby the Company has the option to redeem the notes, in whole or in part, on or after November 15, 2017 at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and on or after November 15, 2015 at par plus a premium declining ratably to par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Prior to November 15, 2015, the notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to par plus a make-whole premium as provided in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The senior notes due 2022 carry optional redemption features whereby the Company has the option to redeem the notes, in whole or in part, on or after June 1, 2020 at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and on or after June 1, 2017 at par plus a premium declining ratably to par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Prior to June 1, 2017, the notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to par plus a make-whole premium as provided in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The senior notes due 2023 carry optional redemption features whereby the Company has the option to redeem the notes, in whole or in part, on or after November 1, 2021 at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and on or after November 1, 2018 at par plus a premium declining ratably to par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Prior to November 1, 2018, the notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to par plus a make-whole premium as provided in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, on or prior to November 1, 2016, the Company has the right to redeem at par plus a specified premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of notes originally issued, subject to certain limitations, with the proceeds from certain kinds of equity offerings, as defined in the indenture. The ABL facility does not contain any restriction against the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness. However, the ABL facility restricts the incurrence of secured indebtedness if, after giving effect to the incurrence of such secured indebtedness, the Company's Secured Leverage Ratio exceeds 4.0 to 1.0. At September 30, 2015, the Company's Secured Leverage Ratio was less than 0.1 to 1.0. Secured Leverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) Secured Funded Indebtedness (as defined in the ABL facility) to (ii) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the ABL facility). The ABL facility is pre-payable and the commitments thereunder may be terminated, in whole or in part at any time without penalty or premium. 68 Table of Contents The indentures governing the senior notes due 2019, 2022 and 2023 contain terms which restrict the ability of Sally Beauty's subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness. However, in addition to certain other material exceptions, the Company may incur additional indebtedness under the indentures if its Consolidated Coverage Ratio, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such indebtedness, exceeds 2.0 to 1.0 ("Incurrence Test"). At September 30, 2015, the Company's Consolidated Coverage Ratio was approximately 5.6 to 1.0. Consolidated Coverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the indentures) for the period containing the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters, to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense (as defined in the indentures) for such period. The indentures governing the senior notes due 2019, 2022 and 2023 restrict Sally Holdings and its subsidiaries from making certain dividends and distributions to equity holders and certain other restricted payments (hereafter, a "Restricted Payment" or "Restricted Payments") to us. However, the indentures permit the making of such Restricted Payments if, at the time of the making of such Restricted Payment, the Company satisfies the Incurrence Test as described above and the cumulative amount of all Restricted Payments made since the issue date of the applicable senior notes does not exceed the sum of: (i) 50% of Sally Holdings' and its subsidiaries' cumulative consolidated net earnings since July 1, 2006, plus (ii) the proceeds from the issuance of certain equity securities or conversions of indebtedness to equity, in each case, since the issue date of the applicable senior notes plus (iii) the net reduction in investments in unrestricted subsidiaries since the issue date of the applicable senior notes plus (iv) the return of capital with respect to any sales or dispositions of certain minority investments since the issue date of the applicable senior notes. Further, in addition to certain other baskets, the indentures permit the Company to make additional Restricted Payments in an unlimited amount if, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of any indebtedness to make such Restricted Payment, the Company's Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the indentures) is less than 3.25 to 1.00. At September 30, 2015, the Company's Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio was approximately 2.8 to 1.0. Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) Consolidated Total Indebtedness, as defined in the indentures, minus cash and cash equivalents on-hand up to $100.0 million, in each case, as of the end of the most recently-ended fiscal quarter to (ii) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the indentures) for the period containing the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters. The ABL facility also restricts the making of Restricted Payments. More specifically, under the ABL facility, Sally Holdings may make Restricted Payments if availability under the ABL facility equals or exceeds certain thresholds, and no default then exists under the facility. For Restricted Payments up to $30.0 million during each fiscal year, borrowing availability must equal or exceed the lesser of $75.0 million or 15% of the borrowing base for 45 days prior to such Restricted Payment. For Restricted Payments in excess of that amount, borrowing availability must equal or exceed the lesser of $100.0 million or 20% of the borrowing base for 45 days prior to such Restricted Payment and the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined below) must equal or exceed 1.1 to 1.0. Further, if borrowing availability equals or exceeds the lesser of $150.0 million or 30% of the borrowing base, Restricted Payments are not limited by the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test. The Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the ABL facility) during the trailing twelve-month period preceding such proposed Restricted Payment minus certain unfinanced capital expenditures made during such period and income tax payments paid in cash during such period to (ii) fixed charges (as defined in the ABL facility). In addition, during any period that borrowing availability under the ABL facility is less than the greater of $40.0 million or 10% of the borrowing base, the level of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio that the Company must satisfy is 1.0 to 1.0. As of September 30, 2015, the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio was approximately 3.5 to 1.0. When used in this Annual Report, the phrase "Consolidated EBITDA" is intended to have the meaning given to such phrase in the ABL facility or the indentures governing the senior notes due 2019, 2022 and 2023, as appropriate. EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and should not be considered a substitute for 69 Table of Contents financial performance and liquidity measures determined in accordance with GAAP, such as net earnings, operating earnings and operating cash flows. We are currently in compliance with the agreements and instruments governing our debt, including our financial covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants in future periods will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which in turn will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. Further, our ability to comply with these covenants in future periods will also depend substantially on the pricing of our products, our success at implementing cost reduction initiatives and our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy. Please see "Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Substantial Indebtedness." Capital Requirements During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, we had total capital expenditures of approximately $118.1 million, including amounts incurred but not paid at September 30, 2015 (approximately $11.6 million), which were primarily to fund the addition of new stores and store remodels, expansion or relocation of existing stores in the ordinary course of our business, as well as ongoing information technology upgrades. For the fiscal year 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of approximately $125.0 million to $135.0 million, excluding acquisitions. Capital expenditures will be primarily to fund the addition of new stores, store remodels, upgrades to our distribution centers in the U.S., expansion or relocation of existing stores, as well as certain corporate projects in the ordinary course of our business, including ongoing technology upgrades. Contractual Obligations The following table is a summary of our contractual cash obligations and commitments outstanding by future payment dates at September 30, 2015 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Total Long-term debt obligations, including interest obligations(a) $ 112,318 $ 224,279 $ 928,720 $ 1,165,196 $ 2,430,513 Obligations under operating leases(b) 172,144 260,815 130,698 71,730 635,387 Purchase obligations(c) 18,253 19,000 19,000 18,208 74,461 Other long-term obligations(d)(e) 14,921 9,125 4,665 7,780 36,491 Total $ 317,636 $ 513,219 $ 1,083,083 $ 1,262,914 $ 3,176,852 (a) Long-term debt obligations include obligations under capital leases and future interest payments on senior notes outstanding as of September 30, 2015. The amounts shown above do not include unamortized premium and deferred debt issuance costs reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheets since those excluded amounts do not represent contractual obligations. (b) In accordance with GAAP, obligations under operating leases are not reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The amounts reported for operating leases do not include common area maintenance (CAM), property taxes or other executory costs. Please see Note 12 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" contained elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information about the Company's operating leases. The amounts shown above do not include obligations of the Company's franchisees under operating leases of approximately $0.8 million for which the Company is contingently liable in the event of default by the franchisee. 70 Table of Contents (c) Purchase obligations reflect legally binding agreements entered into by us to purchase goods or services, that specify minimum quantities to be purchased and with fixed or variable price provisions. In accordance with GAAP, these obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts shown do not reflect open purchase orders, mainly for merchandise, to be fulfilled within one year, which are generally cancellable. (d) Other long-term obligations, including current portion, principally represent obligations under insurance and self-insurance programs. These obligations are included in accrued liabilities and other liabilities, as appropriate, in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. (e) The table above does not include $3.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the realization and timing of the related future cash flows, if any. The information contained in the table above with regards to the Company's long-term debt obligations is based on the current terms of such debt obligations and does not reflect any assumptions about the Company's ability to refinance some or all of its senior notes on or before their maturity. In the event that the Company refinances some or all of its senior notes on or before their maturity, actual payments for some of the periods shown may differ materially from the amounts reported herein. In addition, other future events could cause actual payments to differ materially from these amounts. The majority of our operating leases are for Sally Beauty Supply and BSG stores (which typically are located in strip shopping centers) and for Sally Beauty Supply and BSG distribution centers. The use of operating leases allows us to expand our business to new locations without making significant up-front cash outlays for the purchase of land and buildings. Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements At September 30, 2015 and 2014, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than obligations under operating leases (see Contractual Obligations table above), and letters of credit (related to inventory purchases and self-insurance programs) in the aggregate amount of $23.1 million and $22.0 million, respectively. Inflation We believe inflation did not have a material effect on our results of operations during each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 30, 2015. However, we have recently experienced an upswing in labor and real estate costs in the U.S. Employee compensation and rent expenses represent two of our most significant operating expenses. A material increase in labor and real estate costs in the future, particularly during an extended period of time, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. We consider accounting policies to be critical when they require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and when different estimates that our management reasonably could have used have a material effect on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Our critical accounting estimates include but are not limited to the valuation of inventory, vendor rebates and concessions, retention of risk, income taxes, assessment of long-lived assets and intangible assets for impairment and share-based payments. 71 Table of Contents Valuation of Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost, determined using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, or net realizable value. When necessary, the Company adjusts the carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value, including disposal costs, and for estimated inventory shrinkage. In assessing the net realizable value of inventory, management considers several key factors including estimates of the future demand for the Company's products, historical turn-over rates, the age and sales history of the inventory, and historic as well as anticipated changes in stock keeping units ("SKUs"). We estimate inventory shrinkage between physical counts based upon our historical experience. Actual results differing from these estimates could significantly affect our inventory and cost of products sold and distribution expenses. Inventory shrinkage expense averaged approximately 1.0% of consolidated net sales in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013. A 10% increase or decrease in our estimate of inventory shrinkage at September 30, 2015, would impact net earnings by approximately $1.6 million, net of income tax. Vendor Rebates and Concessions The Company deems a cash consideration received from a supplier to be a reduction of the cost of products sold unless it is in exchange for an asset or service or a reimbursement of a specific, incremental, identifiable cost incurred by the Company in selling the vendor's products. The majority of cash consideration received by the Company is considered to be a reduction of the cost of the related products and is reflected in cost of products sold and distribution expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings as the related products are sold. Any portion of such cash consideration received that is attributable to inventory on hand is reflected as a reduction of inventory. We consider the facts and circumstances of the various contractual agreements with vendors in order to determine the appropriate classification of amounts received in the consolidated statements of earnings. We record cash consideration expected to be received from vendors in other receivables at the amount we believe will be collected. These receivables could be significantly affected if the actual amounts subsequently collected differ from management's expectations. A 10% increase or decrease in these receivables at September 30, 2015, would impact net earnings by approximately $2.3 million, net of income tax. Retention of Risk Employee Health Insurance Liability We maintain a largely self-funded program, primarily in the U.S., for healthcare benefits for employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. We cover the majority of expenses associated with these benefits, other than certain fees and out-of pocket expenses paid by the employees through payroll deductions. Payments for healthcare benefits below specified amounts (currently $350,000 per individual per year) are self-insured by us. We base our estimate of ultimate liability on trends in claim payment history, historical trends in claims incurred but not yet reported, and other components such as expected increases in medical costs, projected premium costs and the number of plan participants. We review our liability on a regular basis and adjust our accruals accordingly. As of September 30, 2015 and 2014, we accrued an estimated liability relating to employee health insurance of $6.5 million and $7.0 million, respectively. Changes in facts and circumstances may lead to a change in the estimated liability due to revisions of the estimated ultimate costs of our employee healthcare benefits. In assessing the adequacy of our employee health insurance liability, management considers several key factors including estimates of medical costs and trends in claims. This liability could be significantly affected if actual results differ from management's expectations. A 10% increase or decrease in our employee health insurance liability at September 30, 2015 would impact net earnings by approximately $0.4 million, net of income tax. 72 Table of Contents Workers' Compensation Liability, General Liability, and Automobile and Property Liability We maintain a large deductible insurance plan for workers' compensation liability, general liability and automobile and property liability loss exposures. We base our estimates of the ultimate liability on an actuarial analysis performed by an independent third-party actuary. We review our liability on a regular basis and adjust our accruals accordingly. As of September 30, 2015 and 2014, our balance sheets included an estimated liability related to these deductible and retention limits of approximately $29.4 million and $31.4 million, respectively. Changes in facts and circumstances may lead to a change in the estimated liability due to revisions of the estimated ultimate costs that affect our workers' compensation, general liability, and automobile and property liability insurance coverage. Changes in estimates occur over time due to such factors as claims incidence and severity of injury or damages. Our liabilities could be significantly affected if actual results differ from management's expectations or actuarial analyses. A 10% increase or decrease in our workers' compensation liability, general liability, and automobile and property liability at September 30, 2015 would impact net earnings by approximately $1.8 million, net of income tax. The change in the insurance and self-insurance liability was as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2015 2014 Balance at beginning of period $ 39,103 $ 37,266 Self-insurance expense 74,277 76,841 Payments, net of employee contributions (76,903 ) (75,004 ) Balance at end of period $ 36,477 $ 39,103 Income Taxes We record income tax provisions in our consolidated financial statements based on an estimation of current income tax liabilities. The development of these provisions requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing. If we prevail in tax matters for which provisions have been established or are required to settle matters in excess of established provisions, our effective tax rate for a particular period could be significantly affected. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the effective income tax rates were 37.9%, 37.0% and 36.7%, respectively. The increase in the effective income tax rate for the fiscal year 2015, compared to the fiscal year 2014, is primarily due to increased foreign tax losses resulting in part from our ongoing expansion into international geographies and a beneficial tax settlement in the fiscal year 2014 without a comparable tax benefit in the fiscal year 2015. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, the annual effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 37.5% to 38.5%. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are estimated to be recovered or settled. We believe that it is more likely than not that our results of operations in the future will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance currently recorded. We have recorded a valuation allowance to account for uncertainties regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, primarily foreign loss carryforwards. In the future, if we determine that certain deferred tax assets will not be realizable, the related adjustments could significantly affect our effective tax rate at that time. The estimated tax benefit of an uncertain tax position is recorded in our financial statements only after 73 Table of Contents determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax position will withstand challenge, if any, from applicable taxing authorities. Assessment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets for Impairment Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, including store equipment, and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. The recoverability of long-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization is assessed by comparing the net carrying amount of each asset to its total estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum of its undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, they are reviewed for impairment at least annually, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the value of the asset may be impaired. When assessing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for potential impairment, management compares the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. In addition, management considers whether the value of an asset has been impaired by evaluating if various factors (including current operating results, anticipated future results and cash flows, and relevant market and economic conditions) indicate a possible impairment. When appropriate, the Company first assesses relevant qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment tests otherwise required under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ("ASC 350"). Based on the reviews performed by the Company and after taking into account recent potential triggering events, including the recent decline in the average daily trading prices for shares of our common stock, there were no material asset impairments recognized in the current or prior fiscal years presented, except for asset impairments in the aggregate amount of $2.5 million recognized in connection with the Germany restructuring in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Share-Based Payments We recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or to the date a participant becomes eligible for retirement, if earlier. For fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, total compensation cost charged against income and included in selling, general and administrative expenses for share-based compensation arrangements was $16.8 million, $22.1 million and $19.2 million, respectively. The amount of stock option expense is determined based on the fair value of each stock option grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following valuation inputs: expected life, volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The expected life of stock options represents the period of time that the stock options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical employee tenure and option exercise trends. The expected volatility reflects the average historical volatility for the Company's common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with a remaining term, at the grant date, equal to the expected life of the stock options. The dividend yield represents our anticipated cash dividend over the expected life of the stock options. The amount of stock option expense recognized is significantly affected by these estimates. In addition, we record periodic stock option expense based on an estimate of the total number of stock options expected to vest, which requires us to estimate future forfeitures. We estimate future forfeitures based on our historical experience. Actual forfeitures could differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the amount and timing of the recognition of stock option expense. We have based all these estimates on management's assumptions as of September 30, 2015. Our estimates for future periods may be based on different assumptions and, accordingly, may differ. 74 Table of Contents We believe that our share-based compensation expenses are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimate or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in share-based compensation expenses that could be material. A 10% change in our share-based compensation expenses for the year ended September 30, 2015 would affect earnings by approximately $1.0 million, net of income tax. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company has not yet adopted and is currently assessing the potential effect of the following pronouncements on its consolidated financial statements: In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers which will supersede Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605, Revenue Recognition . In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of this new standard by one year. A core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should measure revenue in connection with its sale of goods and services to a customer based on an amount that depicts the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for each of those goods and services. For a contract that involves more than one performance obligation, the entity must (a) determine or, if necessary, estimate the standalone selling price at inception of the contract for the distinct goods or services underlying each performance obligation and (b) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative standalone selling prices. In addition, under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue when (or as) it satisfies each performance obligation under the contract by transferring the promised good or service to the customer. A good or service is deemed transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. The new standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. For public companies, this amendment is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted, but no earlier than December 16, 2016. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor determined the effect of the new standard on its financial statements. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments ("ASU 2015-16") which will eliminate the current requirement to recognize measurement-period adjustments to provisional amounts retrospectively. Instead, ASU 2015-16 requires the acquirer to recognize measurement-period adjustments, as well as the impact on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization and similar items (if any) as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, in the period when the amount of each adjustment is determined. For public companies, this amendment is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early application is permitted. In addition, the Company has not yet adopted the following recent accounting pronouncement and it does not believe the adoption of these pronouncements will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements: In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in Cloud Computing Arrangement . This pronouncement provides guidance to determine whether a cloud-based computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud-based computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer must account for the software element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. Otherwise, the customer must account for the arrangement as a service contract. The new standard permits the use of either the prospective or retrospective transition method. For public companies, this amendment is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. 75 Table of Contents Accounting Changes In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ("ASU 2015-03"), which requires that capitalized debt issuance costs be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability. Prior to the issuance of this new standard, the Company had presented capitalized debt issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization, in other assets on its consolidated balance sheets, consistent with applicable GAAP. As permitted, the Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-03, retrospectively, in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-03, at September 30, 2015 and 2014, unamortized debt issuance costs of $21.8 million and $25.7 million, respectively, related to our senior notes are reported as a deduction from the related long-term debt obligations (in long-term debt) on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The adoption of this standard did not have any other impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Please see Notes 4 and 13 below for more information about the Company's long-term debt. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory ("ASU 2015-11"), which is intended to narrow down the alternative methods available for valuing inventory. The new guidance does not apply to inventory currently measured using the last-in-first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory valuation methods. Under the new standard, inventory valued using other methods, including the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method, must be valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis. As permitted, the Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-11 in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 and its adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest Imputation of Interest: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements ("ASU 2015-15") which permits an entity to report deferred debt issuance costs associated with a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset and to amortize such costs over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings under the credit line. For public companies, this amendment is effective concurrently with ASU 2015-03. As permitted, the Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-15 in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 and its adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
