ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW AT&T Inc. is referred to as we, AT&T or the Company throughout this document. AT&T products and services are provided or offered by subsidiaries and affiliates of AT&T Inc. under the AT&T brand and not by AT&T Inc., and the names of the particular subsidiaries and affiliates providing the services generally have been omitted. AT&T is a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates operate worldwide in the telecommunications and technology industries. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes (Notes). Our Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this document generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this document can be found in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. On April 8, 2022, we closed our transaction to combine substantially all of our previous WarnerMedia segment (WarnerMedia) with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc (Discovery). Upon the separation and distribution of WarnerMedia, the WarnerMedia business met the criteria for discontinued operations. For discontinued operations, we also evaluated transactions that were components of AT&T single plan of a strategic shift, including dispositions that did not individually meet the criteria due to materiality, and determined discontinued operations to be comprised of WarnerMedia, Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic Ltd. (Playdemic). These businesses are reflected in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations, including for periods prior to the consummation of the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction. (See Notes 6 and 24) 19 AT&T Inc. Dollars in millions except per share amounts We have two reportable segments: Communications and Latin America. Our segment results presented in Note 4 and discussed below follow our internal management reporting. Each segment percentage calculation of total segment operating revenue is derived from our segment results table in Note 4. Segment operating income is primarily attributable to our Communications segment due to prior-years operating losses in Latin America. Percentage increases and decreases that are not considered meaningful are denoted with a dash.

This segment provides services to businesses and consumers located in the United States and businesses globally. Our business strategies reflect integrated product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets. This segment contains the following business units: Mobility provides nationwide wireless service and equipment. Business Wireline provides advanced ethernet-based fiber services, fixed wireless services, IP Voice and managed professional services, as well as legacy voice and data services and related equipment, to business customers. Consumer Wireline provides broadband services, including fiber connections that provide multi-gig services, and AIA services, to residential customers in select locations. Consumer Wireline also provides legacy telephony voice communication services. The Latin America segment accounted for approximately 3% of our 2024 and 2023 total segment operating revenues and less than 1% of segment operating income in 2024. This segment provides wireless service and equipment in Mexico. 20 AT&T Inc. Dollars in millions except per share amounts RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results Our financial results from continuing operations are summarized in the following table. We then discuss factors affecting our overall results from continuing operations. Additional analysis is discussed in our Segment Results section. We also discuss our expected revenue and expense trends for 2025 in the Operating Environment and Trends of the Business section.

Operations and support expenses decreased in 2024, reflecting lower Mobility equipment costs resulting from lower wireless sales volumes and expense declines from our continued transformation efforts, including lower personnel charges. Asset impairments and abandonments and restructuring increased in 2024. The increase in 2024 was primarily due to a third-quarter noncash goodwill impairment charge of $4,422 associated with our Business Wireline reporting unit. We performed an interim goodwill impairment test of the Business Wireline reporting unit and concluded that the calculated fair value was lower than the book value, which was driven by a faster-than-previously anticipated industry-wide secular decline of legacy services (see Note 9). Noncash charges in 2024 also included restructuring charges, including termination fees associated with our network modernization program to deploy commercial scale open radio access network (Open RAN). Noncash charges in 2023 primarily relate to severance and restructuring charges, as well as the abandonment of non-deployed wireless equipment associated with our Open RAN network modernization program. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2024, primarily due to the shortening of estimated economic lives of wireless network equipment that will be replaced earlier than originally anticipated with our Open RAN network modernization efforts. Also contributing to higher depreciation expense was the impact of ongoing capital spending for strategic initiatives such as fiber and network upgrades. Operating income decreased in 2024 and increased in 2023. Our operating margin was 15.6% in 2024, compared to 19.2% in 2023, and (3.8)% in 2022, which included noncash goodwill impairment charges of $24,812. Interest expense increased in 2024, primarily due to lower capitalized interest associated with spectrum acquisitions, mostly offset by lower debt balances. Interest expense in 2023 also includes distributions on Mobility preferred interests, which were repurchased on April 5, 2023 (see Note 16). 21 AT&T Inc. Dollars in millions except per share amounts Equity in net income of affiliates increased in 2024. The increase reflects cash distributions received by AT&T in excess of the carrying amount of our investment in DIRECTV, partially offset by the performance of our investment in DIRECTV (see Notes 10 and 19). Other income (expense) net increased in 2024. The increase was primarily driven by actuarial remeasurement of benefit plan assets and obligations, with an actuarial loss of $56 in 2024, compared to net actuarial and settlement losses of $1,594 in 2023 (see Note 14). Also contributing to the increase was the prior-year write-down of our SKY Mexico equity investment. These increases were partially offset by lower pension and postretirement benefit credits and lower returns on other benefit-related investments. Income tax expense increased in 2024. While our income before income taxes decreased in 2024, it includes a goodwill impairment associated with our Business Wireline reporting unit, which is not deductible for tax purposes and results in a higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate was 26.6% in 2024, 21.3% in 2023, and (122.2)% in 2022. The effective tax rate in 2022 was also impacted by goodwill impairments, which are not deductible for tax purposes. Segment Results Our segments are comprised of strategic business units or other operations that offer products and services to different customer segments over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We evaluate segment performance based on operating income as well as EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin. See Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures for a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA margin to the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Revenue declines were also driven by lower Mobility equipment revenue. These decreases were partially offset by increases in Mobility service revenue and our Consumer Wireline business unit, driven by gains in wireless and broadband services. Operating income decreased in 2024 and increased in 2023. The 2024 operating income reflects a decrease in operating income from our Business Wireline business unit, partially offset by increases in our Mobility and Consumer Wireline business units. Our Communications segment operating income margin was 23.0% in 2024, 23.6% in 2023 and 22.8% in 2022. Our Communications segment EBITDA margin was 39.5% in 2024, 38.3% in 2023 and 37.1% in 2022. 22 AT&T Inc.

Tablet net adds (losses) were 167, (68) and 203 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Wearables and other net adds were 430, 639 and 1,020 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 3 Calculated by dividing the aggregate number of wireless subscribers who canceled service during a month by the total number of wireless subscribers at the beginning of that month. The churn rate for the period is equal to the average of the churn rate for each month of that period, excluding the impact of disconnections resulting from our 3G network shutdown in February 2022. 23 AT&T Inc. Dollars in millions except per share amounts Service revenue increased during 2024, largely due to growth from subscriber gains and higher postpaid average revenue per subscriber (ARPU). ARPU ARPU increased in 2024 and reflects pricing actions. Churn The effective management of subscriber churn is critical to our ability to maximize revenue growth and to maintain and improve margins. Postpaid churn and postpaid phone-only churn were lower in 2024. Equipment revenue decreased in 2024, primarily driven by lower wireless device sales volumes. The decrease was partially offset by sales of higher-priced phones in 2024. Operations and support expenses decreased in 2024, largely due to lower equipment and selling costs driven by lower wireless sales volumes, partially offset by higher network costs. Depreciation expense increased in 2024, primarily due to shortening of estimated economic lives of wireless equipment that will be replaced earlier than originally anticipated with our Open RAN deployment and network transformation, and ongoing capital spending for network upgrades and expansion, which we expect to continue through 2025. Operating income increased in 2024 and 2023. Our Mobility operating income margin was 30.9% in 2024, 30.8% in 2023 and 29.1% in 2022. Our Mobility EBITDA margin was 42.8% in 2024, 40.9% in 2023 and 39.1% in 2022. Business Wireline Results Percent Change 2024 2023 2022 2024 vs. 2023 2023 vs. 2022 Operating revenues Service $ 18,064 $ 20,274 $ 21,891 (10.9) % (7.4) % Equipment 755 609 647 24.0 (5.9) Total Operating Revenues 18,819 20,883 22,538 (9.9) (7.3) Operating expenses Operations and support 13,352 14,217 14,934 (6.1) (4.8) Depreciation and amortization 5,555 5,377 5,314 3.3 1.2 Total Operating Expenses 18,907 19,594 20,248 (3.5) (3.2) Operating Income (Loss) $ (88) $ 1,289 $ 2,290 % (43.7) % Service revenues decreased in 2024, driven by lower demand for legacy voice, data and network services along with product simplification, partially offset by growth in fiber and connectivity services. We expect these trends to continue. Revenue declines also were impacted by the absence of revenues from our cybersecurity business that was contributed to LevelBlue and higher intellectual property sales in the prior year. Equipment revenues increased in 2024, driven by higher customer premises equipment sales, which can vary from year to year based on the nature of services purchased. Operations and support expenses decreased in 2024, primarily driven by lower personnel costs associated with ongoing transformation initiatives, lower network access and customer support expenses and the contribution of our cybersecurity business. Partially offsetting the decreases were higher vendor credits in 2023 and higher equipment costs in 2024. As part of our transformation activities, we expect operations and support expense improvements to continue in 2025 as we further right size our operations in alignment with the strategic direction of the business. Depreciation expense increased in 2024, primarily due to ongoing capital investment for strategic initiatives such as fiber, which we expect to further increase in 2025. Operating income decreased in 2024 and 2023. Our Business Wireline operating income margin was (0.5)% in 2024, 6.2% in 2023 and 10.2% in 2022. Our Business Wireline EBITDA margin was 29.1% in 2024, 31.9% in 2023 and 33.7% in 2022. 24 AT&T Inc.

Broadband revenues increased in 2024, driven by an increase in fiber customers, which we expect to continue as we invest further in building our fiber footprint, and higher ARPU, partially offset by declines in copper-based broadband services. Legacy voice and data service revenues decreased in 2024, reflecting the continued decline in demand for these services in favor of other technologies, such as wireless and fiber. Other service and equipment revenues decreased in 2024, reflecting the continued decline in the number of VoIP customers. Operations and support expenses decreased in 2024, driven by lower customer support costs, lower marketing expense and savings from cost initiatives, offset by higher network-related costs as our fiber build scales. 25 AT&T Inc.

Operations and support expenses increased in 2024, driven by increased equipment and selling costs resulting from higher sales, partially offset by favorable impact of foreign exchange. Depreciation expense decreased in 2024, driven by lower in-service assets and favorable impact of foreign exchange. Operating income improved in 2024 and 2023. Our Mexico operating income margin was 0.9% in 2024, (3.6)% in 2023 and (10.4)% in 2022. Our Mexico EBITDA margin was 16.5% in 2024, 14.8% in 2023 and 10.6% in 2022. 26 AT&T Inc. Dollars in millions except per share amounts OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS OF THE BUSINESS 2025 Revenue Trends We expect revenue growth in our wireless and broadband businesses as customers demand instant connectivity and higher speeds made possible by wireless network enhancements through 5G deployment and our fiber network expansion. We believe that our simplified go-to-market strategy for 5G in underpenetrated markets will continue to contribute to wireless subscriber and service revenue growth and that expansion of our fiber footprint and our multi-gig offerings will drive greater demand for broadband services on our fast-growing fiber network, as well as increasing our converged customers that have both wireless and fiber. As we expand our fiber reach, we will be orienting our business portfolio to leverage this opportunity to offset continuing declines in legacy Business Wireline products by growing connectivity with small to mid-sized businesses. We plan to use our strong fiber and wireless assets, broad distribution and integrated product offerings to strengthen our overall market position. We will continue to rationalize our product portfolio with a longer-term shift of the business to fiber and mobile connectivity, and growth in value-added services. As customers are demanding faster and more reliable services, we are decommissioning our legacy copper network and enhancing our offerings to include services that provide better experiences over new technologies, such as AT&T Internet Air. 2025 Expense Trends During 2025, we expect expense trends consistent with the prior year, and that we will continue to focus on efficiency, led by our cost transformation initiative. We expect the spending required to support growth and efficiency initiatives, primarily our continued deployment of fiber and 5G, to pressure expense trends in 2025. These investments will help prepare us to meet increased customer demand for enhanced wireless and broadband services, including video streaming, augmented reality, smart technologies, user generated content and artificial intelligence (AI). The software benefits of our 5G wireless technology should result in a more efficient use of capital and lower network-related expenses in the coming years. Furthermore, to the extent customers upgrade their handsets in 2025, the expenses associated with those device sales are expected to contribute to higher costs. We continue to transform our operations to be more efficient and effective. We are restructuring businesses, working with regulators and customers to sunset legacy networks, improving customer service and ordering functions through digital transformation, sizing our support costs and staffing with current activity levels, and reassessing overall benefit costs. We also expect cost savings through AI-driven efficiencies in our network design and operations, software development, sales, marketing, customer support services and general and administrative costs. Market Conditions In recent years, uncertainty surrounding global growth rates, inflation and an increasing interest rate environment continued to produce volatility in the credit, currency and equity markets. We expect ongoing pressure on pricing during 2025 as we respond to the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment and our competitive marketplace, especially in wireless services. Included on our consolidated balance sheets are assets held by benefit plans for the payment of future benefits. Our pension plans are subject to funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). We expect only minimal ERISA contribution requirements to our pension plans for 2025. Investment returns on these assets depend largely on trends in the economy, and a weakness in the equity, fixed income and real asset markets could require us to make future contributions to the pension plans. In addition, our policy of recognizing actuarial gains and losses related to our pension and other postretirement plans in the period in which they arise subjects us to earnings volatility caused by changes in market conditions; however, these actuarial gains and losses do not impact segment performance as they are required to be recorded in Other income (expense) net. Changes in our discount rate, which are tied to changes in the bond market, and changes in the performance of equity markets, may have significant impacts on the valuation of our pension and other postretirement obligations at the end of 2025 (see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates ). Expected Growth Areas Over the next few years, we expect our growth to come from wireless and IP-based fiber broadband services. We provide integrated services to diverse groups of customers in the U.S. on a converged telecommunications network utilizing different technological platforms. In 2025, our key initiatives include: Continuing our wireless subscriber momentum and 5G deployment, with expansion of wireless subscribers in underpenetrated markets and converged customers. Continuing our fiber deployment, improving fiber penetration, growing AT&T Internet Air services, accelerating subscriber growth and increasing broadband revenues. Deploying Open RAN to build a more robust ecosystem of network infrastructure providers and suppliers, fostering lower network costs, improved operational efficiencies and allowing for continued investment in our fast-growing broadband network. Continuing to drive efficiencies and a competitive advantage through cost transformation initiatives and product simplification. 27 AT&T Inc. Dollars in millions except per share amounts Wireless We expect to continue to deliver revenue growth in the coming years. We are in a period of rapid growth in wireless video and data usage and believe that there are substantial opportunities available for next-generation integrated services that combine technologies and services. As of December 31, 2024, we served 141 million wireless subscribers in North America, with 118 million in the United States. Our LTE technology covers over 440 million people in North America, and in the United States, we cover all major metropolitan areas and over 336 million people. When combined with our upgraded backhaul network, we provide enhanced network capabilities and superior mobile broadband speeds for data and video services. In December 2018, we introduced the nation first commercial mobile 5G service and expanded that deployment nationwide in July 2020. At December 31, 2024, our network covers more than 314 million people with 5G technology in the United States and North America. Our networks covering both the U.S. and Mexico have enabled our customers to use wireless services without roaming on other companies networks. We believe this seamless access will prove attractive to customers and provide a significant growth opportunity. At December 31, 2024, we provided LTE coverage to over 104 million people in Mexico. Integration of Wireless and Fiber Services The communications industry has evolved into internet-based technologies capable of converging the offering of wireline and wireless services. As the owner and operator of scaled wireless and fiber networks, we plan to continue to focus on expanding our wireless network capabilities and providing broadband offerings that allow customers to integrate their home or business fixed services with their mobile service. In January 2022, we launched our multi-gig rollout, which brings the fastest internet to AT&T Fiber customers in select locations with symmetrical 2 gig and 5 gig tiers. We intend to continue to develop and provide unique integrated mobile and broadband/fiber solutions. REGULATORY LANDSCAPE AT&T subsidiaries operating within the United States are subject to federal and state regulatory authorities. While these issues may apply only to certain subsidiaries, the words we, AT&T and our are used to simplify the discussion. The following discussions are intended as a condensed summary of the issues rather than as a comprehensive legal analysis and description of all of these specific issues. International Regulation Our subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory authorities in the territories in which the subsidiaries operate. Our licensing, compliance and advocacy initiatives in foreign countries primarily enable the provision of enterprise (i.e., large business) services globally and wireless services in Mexico. The General Data Protection Regulation went into effect in Europe in May of 2018. This regulation created a range of new compliance obligations and significantly increased financial penalties for noncompliance. AT&T processes and handles personal data of its customers and subscribers, employees of its enterprise customers and its employees. U.S. Regulation In the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Telecom Act), Congress established a national policy framework intended to bring the benefits of competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition and reducing or eliminating regulatory burdens that harm consumer welfare. Nonetheless, since then, the FCC and some state regulatory commissions have maintained, re-imposed or expanded certain regulatory requirements that were imposed decades ago on our traditional wireline subsidiaries when they operated as legal monopolies. Recently, the FCC regulatory approach has depended on control of the executive branch, eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations in a number of areas, while imposing or re-imposing regulations in other areas. We continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts, at both the state and federal levels, to reduce inappropriate regulatory burdens that inhibit our ability to compete effectively and offer needed services to our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks. At the same time, we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services, which are subject to vigorous competition. We have organized the following discussion by service impacted. Internet Until 2015, the FCC classified fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as information services subject to minimal regulation. In 2015, the FCC reclassified such services as telecommunications services subject to broader regulation by the FCC and imposed net neutrality rules. Since then, the FCC has twice reversed course, most recently again reclassifying such services as telecommunications services subject to broader regulation by the FCC in an order adopted on April 25, 2024. Multiple trade associations and other parties challenged the FCC reclassification decision in appeals consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The trade associations petitioned the Sixth Circuit to stay the FCC order. On August 1, 2024, the Sixth Circuit issued a stay of the FCC order pending review of the appeals, holding that broadband providers are likely to succeed on the merits. On January 2, 2025, the Sixth Circuit issued an order granting the petition for review and setting aside the FCC net neutrality order, holding that broadband internet access service is an information service. 28 AT&T Inc. Dollars in millions except per share amounts At least one state has adopted legislation regulating the rates of fixed broadband service. In 2021, New York enacted the Affordable Broadband Act (ABA), requiring ISPs offering fixed mass-market broadband service, including fixed wireless, to offer discounted plans to low-income customers. In June 2021, the ABA was enjoined by a federal district court, which found the ABA preempted by federal law. In April 2024, the Second Circuit overruled and vacated the district court order. In August 2024, trade associations asked the Supreme Court to review the Second Circuit decision. On December 16, the Supreme Court issued an order denying the request. Those associations have since requested rehearing of that Supreme Court decision. Under an agreement with the New York Attorney General, the law began to be enforced on January 15, 2025. In response, AT&T announced that it would no longer offer its AT&T Internet Air fixed wireless service in New York. Other states could consider similar legislation. Since 2018, some states have adopted legislation or issued executive orders that established state net neutrality rules, including California and Vermont. We expect additional states may seek to impose net neutrality requirements in the future. On November 15, 2023, the FCC adopted rules to facilitate equal access to broadband and prevent digital discrimination in broadband access. The rules, which became effective March 22, 2024, prohibit covered entities from implementing policies or practices not justified by genuine issues of technical or economic feasibility, that differentially impact consumers access to broadband internet access service based on prohibited characteristics (including income level, race, and ethnicity) or that have such differential impact, whether intentional or not. The rules broadly apply prospectively to all aspects of an ISP service that could impact a consumer ability to access broadband, including deployment, marketing, and credit checks, among other things. We may be required to answer complaints alleging that the company has violated the FCC rules and those complaints may seek relief, including changes to our business practices or civil forfeitures that could result in significant costs or reputational harm. It is currently uncertain how the FCC will implement and enforce these new rules. Several business associations have filed appeals challenging the rules and several of those appeals have been consolidated in the Eighth Circuit, which held oral argument on September 25, 2024. Privacy-related legislation continues to be adopted or considered in a number of jurisdictions. Legislative, regulatory and litigation actions could result in increased costs of compliance, further regulation or claims against broadband internet access service providers and others, and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data. Infrastructure Investment On November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) was signed into law. The legislation appropriates $65,000 to support broadband deployment and adoption. The National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA) is responsible for distributing more than $48,000 of this funding, including $42,500 in state grants for broadband deployment projects in unserved and underserved areas through the Broadband, Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) Programs. NTIA and states are in the process of administering these grants. Where appropriate, AT&T has applied for, and in some cases has been awarded, and may continue to apply for grants under this or other government infrastructure programs. Wireless Industry-wide network densification and 5G technology expansion efforts, which are needed to satisfy extensive demand for video and internet access, will involve significant deployment of small cell equipment. This increases the importance of local permitting processes that allow for the placement of small cell equipment in the public right-of-way on reasonable timelines and terms. The FCC has adopted multiple Orders streamlining federal, state, and local wireless structure review processes that had the tendency to delay and impede deployment of small cell and related infrastructure used to provide telecommunications and broadband services. Additional spectrum will be needed industrywide for 5G and future services. In 2023, the FCC statutory authority to conduct spectrum auctions lapsed and it is uncertain when Congress will reauthorize it. Also in 2023, the federal government released a national spectrum strategy that focused on spectrum sharing but did not include terms of future spectrum sharing model(s) or specific timelines to make additional spectrum bands available for 5G and future generations of service. As a result, the federal government ability and intent to make sufficient spectrum available to the industry in needed timeframes and on terms suitable for mobile broadband network deployments remains uncertain. In June and November 2020, the FCC issued Declaratory Rulings clarifying the limits on state and local authority to deny applications to modify existing structures to accommodate wireless facilities. In September 2024, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals resolved challenges to those Declaratory Rulings, largely sustaining the FCC rulings. The decision ensures that the FCC retains the ability to remove state and local regulations that could delay or impede spectrum and technology upgrades on existing cell site facilities. In recent years, the FCC took several actions to make spectrum available for 5G services, including the auction of 280 MHz of mid-band spectrum previously used for satellite service (the C-Band auction) and 39 GHz band spectrum. AT&T obtained spectrum in these auctions. The FCC also made 150 MHz of mid-band CBRS spectrum available, to be shared with Federal incumbents, which enjoy priority. In addition, in 2022, the FCC completed Auction 110, in which AT&T won 40 MHz of 3.45 GHz spectrum nationwide at a cost of $9,079. (See Note 6) 29 AT&T Inc. Dollars in millions except per share amounts ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND STANDARDS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Because of the size of the financial statement line items they relate to or the extent of judgment required by our management, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our actuarial estimates of retiree benefit expense and the associated significant weighted-average assumptions are discussed in Note 14. Our assumed weighted-average discount rates for pension and postretirement benefits of 5.70% and 5.60%, respectively, at December 31, 2024, reflect the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligations could be effectively settled or paid out to participants. We determined our discount rate based on a range of factors, including a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality, fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected durations of future cash outflows for the obligations. These bonds had an average rating of at least Aa3 or AA- by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, denominated in U.S. dollars, and generally not callable, convertible or index linked. For the year ended December 31, 2024, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, we increased our pension discount rate by 0.70%, resulting in a decrease in our pension plan benefit obligation of $1,994, and increased our postretirement discount rate by 0.60%, resulting in a decrease in our postretirement benefit obligation of $317. Our expected long-term rate of return is 7.75% on pension plan assets and 4.00% on postretirement plan assets for 2024 and 2025. Our expected return on plan assets is calculated using the actual fair value of plan assets. If all other factors were to remain unchanged, we expect that a 0.50% decrease in the expected long-term rate of return would cause 2025 combined pension and postretirement cost to increase $136, which under our accounting policy would be adjusted to actual returns in the current year upon remeasurement of our retiree benefit plans. We recognize gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets and obligations immediately in Other income (expense) net in our consolidated statements of income. These gains and losses are generally measured annually as of December 31, and accordingly, will normally be recorded during the fourth quarter, unless an earlier remeasurement is required. Should actual experience differ from actuarial assumptions, the projected pension benefit obligation and net pension cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement benefit cost would be affected in future years. See Note 14 for additional discussions regarding our assumptions. Asset Valuations and Impairments Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but tested at least annually on October 1 for impairment. For impairment testing, we estimate fair values using models that predominantly rely on the expected cash flows to be derived from the reporting unit or use of the asset. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recoverable over the remaining life. Inputs underlying the expected cash flows include, but are not limited to, subscriber counts, revenue per user, capital investment and acquisition costs per subscriber, and ongoing operating costs. We based our assumptions on a combination of our historical results, trends, business plans and marketplace participant data. Annual Goodwill Testing Goodwill is tested on a reporting unit basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its book value. If the fair value exceeds the book value, then no impairment is measured. We estimate fair values using an income approach (also known as a discounted cash flow model) and market multiple approaches. The income approach utilizes our future cash flow projections with a perpetuity value discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital. The market multiple approach uses the multiples of publicly traded companies whose services are comparable to those offered by the reporting units. During the third quarter of 2024, we updated the long-term strategic plan of our Business Wireline reporting unit. The updated plans reflected lower long-term projected future cash flows associated with the industry-wide secular decline, including a faster-than-previously anticipated decline of legacy services. We identified this as an impairment indicator and performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test of our Business Wireline reporting unit. The interim impairment test methodology was consistent with our approach for annual impairment testing (see Note 1), using similar models updated with our current view of key inputs and assumptions. We concluded that the calculated fair value of the Business Wireline reporting unit was lower than the book value, resulting in a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $4,422 for the entirety of our Business Wireline reporting unit goodwill. As of October 1, 2024, the calculated fair values of the reporting units with remaining goodwill exceeded their book values in all circumstances in excess of 10%. If either the projected long-term growth rates declined by 0.5%, if the projected long-term 30 AT&T Inc. Dollars in millions except per share amounts EBITDA margin declined by 0.5%, or if the weighted average cost of capital increased by 0.5%, the fair values would still be higher than the book value of the reporting units. The fair values of our remaining reporting units could be negatively impacted by future sustained declines in macroeconomic or business conditions, higher discount rates or declines in the value of AT&T stock and could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. U.S. Wireless Licenses The fair value of U.S. wireless licenses is assessed using a discounted cash flow model (the Greenfield Approach) and a qualitative corroborative market approach based on auction prices, depending upon auction activity. The Greenfield Approach assumes a company initially owns only the wireless licenses and makes investments required to build an operation comparable to current use. These licenses are tested annually for impairment on an aggregated basis, consistent with their use on a national scope for the United States. For impairment testing, we assume subscriber and revenue growth will trend up to projected levels, with a long-term growth rate reflecting expected long-term inflation trends. We assume churn rates will initially exceed our current experience but decline to rates that are in line with industry-leading churn. We used a discount rate of 8.75%, based on the optimal long-term capital structure of a market participant and its associated cost of debt and equity for the licenses, to calculate the present value of the projected cash flows. If either the projected rate of long-term growth of cash flows or revenues declined by 0.5%, or if the discount rate increased by 0.5%, the fair values of these wireless licenses would still be higher than the book value. The fair value of these wireless licenses exceeded their book values by more than 10%. Income Taxes Our estimates of income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in Note 13 and reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and probability of these estimates. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the final review of our tax returns by federal, state or foreign tax authorities. We use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements. We regularly review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. These adjustments to our UTBs may affect our income tax expense. Settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash. New Accounting Standards See Note 1 for discussion of recently issued or adopted accounting standards. OTHER BUSINESS MATTERS Environmental We are subject from time to time to judicial and administrative proceedings brought by various governmental authorities under federal, state or local environmental laws. We reference in our Forms 10-Q and 10-K certain environmental proceedings that could result in monetary sanctions (exclusive of interest and costs) of three hundred thousand dollars or more. However, we do not believe that any of those currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 Cash provided by operating activities $ 38,771 $ 38,314 $ 35,812 Cash used in investing activities (17,490) (19,660) (26,899) Cash used in financing activities (24,708) (15,614) (59,564) At December 31, 2024 2023 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,298 $ 6,722 Total debt 123,532 137,331 We had $3,298 in cash and cash equivalents available at December 31, 2024, decreasing $3,424 since December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents included cash of $2,149 and money market funds and other cash equivalents of $1,149. Approximately $1,268 of our cash and cash equivalents were held in accounts outside of the U.S. and may be subject to restrictions on repatriation. 31 AT&T Inc. Dollars in millions except per share amounts In 2024, cash inflows were primarily provided by cash receipts from operations, including cash from our sale and transfer of our receivables to third parties, distributions from DIRECTV and sales of idle Rabbi Trust assets and other investments. These inflows were exceeded by cash used to meet the needs of the business, including, but not limited to, payment of operating expenses. The cash generated from operating activities was used to fund capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, repay short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and dividend payments to stockholders. We maintain availability under our credit facilities and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. Refer to Contractual Obligations discussion below for additional information regarding our cash requirements. Cash Provided by Operating Activities from Continuing Operations During 2024, cash provided by operating activities was $38,771, compared to $38,314 in 2023, reflecting the timing of working capital associated with device payments, as well as the expansion of committed, cost-efficient receivable sales programs, and operational growth, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. We actively manage the timing of our supplier payments for operating items to optimize the use of our cash. Among other things, we seek to make payments on 90-day or greater terms, while providing the suppliers with access to bank facilities that permit earlier payments at their cost (referred to as supplier financing program). In addition, for payments to suppliers of handset inventory, as part of our working capital initiatives, we have arrangements that allow us to extend the stated payment terms by up to 90 days at an additional cost to us (referred to as direct supplier financing). The net impact of direct supplier financing, including principal and interest payments, was to improve cash from operating activities $661 in 2024 and decrease cash from operating activities $299 in 2023. All supplier financing payments are due within one year. (See Note 22) Cash Used in Investing Activities from Continuing Operations During 2024, cash used in investing activities totaled $17,490, consisting primarily of $20,263 (including interest during construction) for capital expenditures. During 2024, net FirstNet sustainability payments were $237. In 2024, we received a return of investment of $928 from DIRECTV representing distributions in excess of cumulative equity in earnings from DIRECTV (see Note 10) and sold Rabbi Trust and other investments totaling $2,575. For capital improvements, we have negotiated favorable vendor payment terms of 120 days or more (referred to as vendor financing) with some of our vendors, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. Vendor financing payments were $1,792 in 2024, compared to $5,742 in 2023. Capital expenditures in 2024 were $20,263, and when including $1,792 cash paid for vendor financing, capital investment was $22,055 ($1,540 lower than the prior year). The vast majority of our capital expenditures are spent on our networks, including product development and related support systems. In 2024, we placed $700 of productive assets (primarily software) in service under vendor financing arrangements (compared to $2,651 in 2023). The amount of capital expenditures is influenced by demand for services and products, capacity needs and network enhancements. In 2025, we expect that our capital investment, which includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing, will be in the $22,000 range. Cash Provided by or Used in Financing Activities from Continuing Operations In 2024, cash used in financing activities totaled $24,708 and was comprised of debt repayments, payments of dividends and vendor financing payments. A tabular summary of our debt activity during 2024 is as follows: First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Full Year 2024 Net commercial paper borrowings $ 428 $ 262 $ (2,686) $ $ (1,996) Repayments: USD notes $ (2,300) $ (1,615) $ $ (2,575) $ (6,490) EUR notes (2,181) (32) (2,213) CAD notes (442) (442) CHF notes (467) (467) Other (204) (136) (203) (142) (685) Repayments of long-term debt $ (4,685) $ (2,225) $ (203) $ (3,184) $ (10,297) 32 AT&T Inc. Dollars in millions except per share amounts The weighted average interest rate of our long-term debt portfolio, including credit agreement borrowings and the impact of derivatives, was approximately 4.2% as of December 31, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023. We had $122,116 of total notes and debentures outstanding at December 31, 2024. This also included Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc and Australian dollar denominated debt that totaled approximately $30,685. At December 31, 2024, we had $5,089 of long-term debt maturing within one year. We had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings or other short-term borrowings on December 31, 2024. The weighted average interest rate on our outstanding short-term borrowings was approximately 6.0% as of December 31, 2023. During 2024, we paid $1,792 of cash under our vendor financing program, compared to $5,742 in 2023. Total vendor financing payables included in our December 31, 2024 consolidated balance sheet were $1,448, with $749 due within one year (in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ) and the remainder predominantly due within five years (in Other noncurrent liabilities ). In December 2024, our Board of Directors approved a $10,000 share repurchase authorization and terminated the March 2014 authorization, under which approximately 144 million shares were available for repurchase. At December 31, 2024, we had $10,000 remaining from our common stock repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors in December 2024. We paid dividends on common and preferred shares of $8,208 in 2024, compared with $8,136 in 2023. Dividends on common stock declared by our Board of Directors totaled $1.11 per share in 2024 and in 2023. Our dividend policy considers the expectations and requirements of stockholders, capital funding requirements of AT&T and long-term growth opportunities. Our 2025 financing activities will focus on managing our debt level and paying dividends, subject to approval by our Board of Directors, and repurchasing common stock when deemed appropriate. We plan to fund our financing uses of cash through a combination of cash from operations, issuance of debt and asset sales. The timing and mix of any debt issuance and/or refinancing will be guided by credit market conditions and interest rate trends. Credit Facilities The following summary of our various credit and loan agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to each agreement filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We use credit facilities as a tool in managing our liquidity status. We currently have a $12,000 revolving credit agreement that terminates on November 18, 2029 (Revolving Credit Agreement). No amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024. We also utilize other external financing sources, which include various credit arrangements supported by government agencies to support network equipment purchases as well as a commercial paper program. Our Revolving Credit Agreement contains covenants that are customary for an issuer with an investment grade senior debt credit rating as well as a net debt-to-EBITDA financial ratio covenant requiring AT&T to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of not more than 3.75-to-1. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants for our credit facilities. Collateral Arrangements Most of our counterparty collateral arrangements require cash collateral posting by AT&T only when derivative market values exceed certain thresholds. Under these arrangements, which cover the majority of our $34,884 derivative portfolio, counterparties are still required to post collateral. During 2024, we received $477 of cash collateral, on a net basis. Cash postings under these arrangements vary with changes in credit ratings and netting agreements. (See Note 12) Other Our total capital consists of debt (long-term debt and debt maturing within one year), redeemable noncontrolling interest and stockholders equity. Our capital structure does not include debt issued by our equity method investments. At December 31, 2024, our debt ratio was 50.7%, compared to 53.5% at December 31, 2023 and 56.1% at December 31, 2022. The debt ratio is affected by the same factors that affect total capital, and reflects our recent debt issuances, repayments and reclassifications related to redemption of noncontrolling interests. 33 AT&T Inc. Dollars in millions except per share amounts A significant amount of our cash outflows for continuing operations is related to tax items, acquisition of spectrum through FCC auctions and benefits paid for current and former employees: Total taxes incurred, collected and remitted by AT&T during 2024 and 2023 were $16,968 and $16,877. These taxes include income, franchise, property, sales, excise, payroll, gross receipts and various other taxes and fees. Total domestic spectrum acquired primarily through FCC auctions, including cash, exchanged spectrum, auction deposits and spectrum relocation and clearing costs, was approximately $380 in 2024, $2,940 in 2023 and $10,200 in 2022. Total health and welfare benefits provided to certain active and retired employees and their dependents totaled approximately $2,550 in 2024 and $2,990 in 2023, with $736 paid from plan assets in 2024, compared to $624 in 2023. Of those benefits, approximately $2,290 related to medical and prescription drug benefits in 2024, compared to $2,730 in 2023. We paid $2,447 of pension benefits out of plan assets in 2024, compared to $4,863 in 2023. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024, and the estimated timing of payment, are in the following table: Payments Due By Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Long-term debt obligations 1 $ 135,952 $ 5,399 $ 14,962 $ 13,823 $ 101,768 Interest payments on long-term debt 2 90,504 5,549 10,300 9,326 65,329 Purchase obligations 3 27,997 9,916 10,982 5,495 1,604 Operating lease obligations 4 25,475 4,789 7,693 5,015 7,978 FirstNet sustainability payments 5 16,449 420 2,462 3,132 10,435 Unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) 6 9,912 245 9,667 Other finance obligations 7 8,802 1,522 2,039 1,566 3,675 Total Contractual Obligations $ 315,091 $ 27,840 $ 48,438 $ 38,357 $ 200,456 1 Represents principal or payoff amounts of notes, debentures and credit agreement borrowings at maturity (see Note 11). Foreign debt includes the impact from hedges, when applicable. 2 Includes credit agreement borrowings. 3 We expect to fund the purchase obligations with cash provided by operations or through incremental borrowings. The minimum commitment for certain obligations is based on termination penalties that could be paid to exit the contracts. (See Note 21) 4 Represents operating lease payments (see Note 8). 5 Represents contractual commitment to make sustainability payments over the 25-year contract. These sustainability payments represent our commitment to fund FirstNet operating expenses and future reinvestment in the network, which we own and operate. FirstNet has a statutory requirement to reinvest funds that exceed the agency operating expenses, which we anticipate to be $15,000. (See Note 20) 6 The noncurrent portion of the UTBs is included in the More than 5 Years column, as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of additional cash payments, if any, at this time (see Note 13). 7 Represents future minimum payments under the Crown Castle and other arrangements (see Note 18), payables subject to extended payment terms (see Note 22) and finance lease payments (see Note 8). Certain items were excluded from this table because the year of payment is unknown and could not be reliably estimated, we believe the obligations are immaterial, or the settlement of the obligation will not require the use of cash. These items include: deferred income tax liability of $58,939 (see Note 13); net postemployment benefit obligations of $9,595 (including current portion); and other noncurrent liabilities of $8,292. 34 AT&T Inc. Dollars in millions except per share amounts DISCUSSION AND RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES We also evaluate segment and business unit performance based on EBITDA, which is defined as operating income excluding depreciation and amortization, and/or EBITDA margin, which is defined as EBITDA divided by total revenue. EBITDA is used as part of our management reporting, and we believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it measures the cash generation potential of our business units. EBITDA does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating income nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. There are material limitations to using these non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA and EBITDA margin, as we have defined them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 2024 2023 2022 Communications Segment Operating income $ 27,095 $ 27,801 $ 26,736 Add: Depreciation and amortization expense 19,433 17,363 16,681 EBITDA $ 46,528 $ 45,164 $ 43,417 Operating income margin 23.0 % 23.6 % 22.8 % EBITDA margin 39.5 % 38.3 % 37.1 % Mobility Operating income $ 26,314 $ 25,861 $ 23,812 Add: Depreciation and amortization expense 10,217 8,517 8,198 EBITDA $ 36,531 $ 34,378 $ 32,010 Operating income margin 30.9 % 30.8 % 29.1 % EBITDA margin 42.8 % 40.9 % 39.1 % Business Wireline Operating income $ (88) $ 1,289 $ 2,290 Add: Depreciation and amortization expense 5,555 5,377 5,314 EBITDA $ 5,467 $ 6,666 $ 7,604 Operating income margin (0.5) % 6.2 % 10.2 % EBITDA margin 29.1 % 31.9 % 33.7 % Consumer Wireline Operating income $ 869 $ 651 $ 634 Add: Depreciation and amortization expense 3,661 3,469 3,169 EBITDA $ 4,530 $ 4,120 $ 3,803 Operating income margin 6.4 % 4.9 % 5.0 % EBITDA margin 33.4 % 31.3 % 29.8 % Latin America Segment Operating income $ 40 $ (141) $ (326) Add: Depreciation and amortization expense 657 724 658 EBITDA $ 697 $ 583 $ 332 Operating income margin 0.9 % (3.6) % (10.4) % EBITDA margin 16.5 % 14.8 % 10.6 % 35 AT&T Inc.
