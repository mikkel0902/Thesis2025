Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors for a discussion of forward-looking statements and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements. We use a 52- or 53-week fiscal year, with each fiscal year ending on the Sunday that is closest to November 30 of that year. See Financial Information Presentation Fiscal Year. This Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. To supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures throughout this Annual Report, as described further below, to provide investors with additional useful information about our financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance from management point of view and because we believe they provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry. However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, our consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on our calculation of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Overview We are an iconic American company with a rich history of profitable growth, quality, innovation and corporate citizenship. Our story began in San Francisco, California, in 1853 as a wholesale dry goods business. We created the first riveted blue jean 20 years later. Today we design, market and sell products that include jeans, casual and dress pants, activewear, tops, shorts, skirts, dresses, jackets and related accessories for men, women and children around the world under our Levi , Dockers , Levi Strauss Signature and Denizen and Beyond Yoga brands. We service our consumers through our global infrastructure which develops, sources and markets our products around the world. In the first quarter of 2024 we announced the strategic decision to discontinue the Denizen brand. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we announced we are undertaking an evaluation of strategic alternatives to the global Dockers business, including a sale or other strategic transactions. We operate our business according to three reportable segments: Americas, Europe, and Asia, collectively comprising our Levi's Brands business, which includes the Levi's , Levi Strauss Signature and Denizen brands. The Dockers and Beyond Yoga businesses do not meet the quantitative thresholds for reportable segments and therefore are presented in our financial statements under the caption of Other Brands. Our iconic, enduring brands are brought to life every day around the world by our talented and creative employees and partners. The Levi brand epitomizes classic, authentic American style and effortless cool. We have cultivated Levi as a lifestyle brand that is inclusive and democratic in the eyes of consumers while offering products that feel exclusive, personalized and original. This approach has enabled the Levi brand to evolve with the times and continually reach a new, younger audience, while our rich heritage continues to drive relevance and appeal across demographics. The Dockers brand helped drive Casual Friday in the 1990s and has been a cornerstone of casual menswear for more than 30 years. The Levi Strauss Signature and Denizen brands, which we developed for value-conscious consumers, offer quality craftsmanship and great fit and style at affordable prices. The Beyond Yoga brand is a body positive, premium athleisure apparel brand focused on quality, fit and comfort. 45 Table of Contents We recognize wholesale revenue from sales of our products through third-party retailers such as department stores, specialty retailers, third-party e-commerce sites and franchise locations dedicated to our brands. We also sell our products directly to consumers ( DTC ) through a variety of formats, including our own company-operated mainline and outlet stores, company-operated e-commerce sites and select shop-in-shops that we operate within department stores and other third-party retail locations. As of December 1, 2024, our products were sold in approximately 50,000 retail locations in approximately 120 countries, including approximately 3,400 brand-dedicated stores and shop-in-shops. As of December 1, 2024, we had company-operated stores located in 39 countries and approximately 600 company-operated shop-in-shops. The remainder of our brand-dedicated stores and shop-in-shops were operated by franchisees and other partners. Across all of our brands, pants including jeans, casual pants, dress pants, shorts, skirts, and activewear represented 67% and 68% of our total units sold in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. Tops including shirts, sweaters, jackets, dresses and jumpsuits represented 27% and 26% of our total units sold in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remainder of our products are footwear and accessories. Men's products generated 63% and 64% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. Women's products generated 36% and 34% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remainder of our products are non-gendered. Products other than denim bottoms which include tops, footwear and accessories and pants excluding jeans represented 39% of our net revenues in both fiscal years 2024 and 2023. Our Europe and Asia businesses, collectively, contributed 42% of our net revenues and 40% of our segment operating income in fiscal year 2024, as compared to 43% of our net revenues and 46% of our segment operating income in fiscal year 2023. Revenues from our international business, which includes our Europe and Asia segments, as well as Canada and Latin America from our Americas segment, represented 57% and 56% of our net revenues in fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023, respectively. Sales of Levi brand products represented approximately 89% and 87% of our net revenues in fiscal year 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our wholesale channel generated 54% and 57% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. Sales to franchise partners, included as a component of our wholesale channel, generated 6% of our net revenues in both fiscal years 2024 and 2023. Our DTC channel generated 46% and 43% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, with our company operated e-commerce business representing 21% and 20% of DTC channel net revenues and 10% and 9% of total net revenues in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our key long-term objectives are to strengthen our brands globally in order to deliver sustainable profitable growth and generate industry-leading shareholder returns. Critical strategies to achieve these objectives include being a brand-led business, putting DTC first, and further powering the portfolio by diversifying across geographies, categories, genders and channels. We intend to achieve these strategies through operational excellence and a one team mindset. Supply Chain Disruption of container shipping traffic through the Red Sea and surrounding waterways is affecting transit times and shipping costs for goods manufactured in Asia and destined to Europe and the U.S. We have taken actions to divert the flow of goods and are negotiating with shipping companies on the cost impacts to minimize impacts on the business. Additionally, inflationary pressures, competition for, and price volatility of, resources throughout the supply chain persist. We continue to pursue mitigation strategies and create new efficiencies in our global supply chain. Effects of Inflation Inflationary pressures persist, including increased costs of labor and increased supply chain costs. Trends such as these have resulted in higher product costs in previous periods and may do so again in the future, increasing pressure to reduce costs and raise product prices, which could have a negative impact on consumer demand. If these inflationary pressures continue, our revenue, operating margins and net income will be impacted in 2025. Project Fuel In the first quarter of 2024, our Board of Directors (the "Board") approved a multi-year global productivity initiative, Project Fuel designed to accelerate the execution of our Brand Led and DTC First strategies while fueling long-term profitable growth. This will be a two-year initiative beginning in 2024, with a focus on optimizing our operating model and structure, redesigning business processes and identifying opportunities to reduce costs and simplify processes across our organization. The first phase of the global productivity initiative was completed primarily in the first half of 2024, resulting in the Company recognizing $188.7 million in restructuring charges for the year ended December 1, 2024, primarily due to severance, other post-employment benefits, contract terminations and asset impairments, recorded within Restructuring charges, net in the consolidated statements of income. Additionally, the Company is changing its distribution strategy from an owned and 46 Table of Contents operated model to a mix of owned and third-party operated distribution centers, which has and will continue to result in the sale, lease or transfer of certain distribution centers currently owned and operated by the Company to third-party logistics providers. During the year ended December 1, 2024, we also recognized $54.3 million of restructuring related charges primarily consisting of consulting fees and an impairment charge of $11.1 million related to capitalized internal-use software as a result of the decision to discontinue certain technology projects in connection with Project Fuel, recorded within Selling, general, and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) in the Company consolidated statements of income, and $5.5 million in goodwill impairment charges related to our footwear business as a result of the decision to discontinue the category recorded within Goodwill and other intangible impairment charges in the Company consolidated statements of income. We may incur additional significant restructuring and related charges as we progress our global productivity initiative, which could be material in a future fiscal quarter or year. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company announced that it has initiated a formal review of strategic alternatives for the Dockers brand, which could include a potential sale or other strategic transaction. The Company has retained Bank of America as its financial advisor. The Company has not set a deadline or definitive timetable for the completion of the strategic alternatives review process, and there can be no assurance that this process will result in any transaction or particular outcome. Other Factors Affecting Our Business We believe the other key business and marketplace factors that are impacting our business include the following: Inflation and other macroeconomic pressures in the U.S. and the global economy such as rising interest rates, energy prices, potential new tariffs and recession fears are creating a complex and challenging retail environment for us and our customers as consumers reduce discretionary spending. A decline in consumer spending has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our revenues, operating margins and net income. These trends historically have impacted and may impact our future financial results, affecting revenue, operating margins and net income. The diversification of our business model across geographies, channels, brands, and categories affects our gross margin. For example, if our sales in higher gross margin geographies, channels, brands and categories grow at a faster rate than in our lower gross margin business geographies, channels, brands and categories, we would expect a favorable impact to aggregate gross margin over time. Gross margin in our Europe segment is generally higher than in our Americas and Asia segments. DTC sales generally have higher gross margins than sales through third parties, although DTC sales also typically have higher selling expenses and could have lower profitability. As we continue to execute on our strategic framework to be DTC first, we expect to see greater impact on our margins. Enhancements to our existing product offerings, or our expansion into new brands and products categories, may also impact our future gross margin. Foreign currencies continue to be volatile. Significant fluctuations of the U.S. Dollar against various foreign currencies, including the Euro and Mexican Peso, has in the past and may in the future negatively impact our financial results, revenue, operating margins and net income. The current domestic and international political environment, including volatile trade relations and military and civil conflicts, have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy. There is greater uncertainty with respect to potential changes in trade regulations, tariffs, sanctions and export controls which also increase volatility in the global economy. This environment has affected and may continue to affect production and distribution lead times, increasing our costs and potentially affecting our ability to meet customer demand. If these disruptions persist, they may require us to modify our current sourcing practices, which may impact our product costs, and, if not mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reached agreement among over 140 countries to implement a minimum 15% tax rate on certain multinational enterprises, commonly referred to as Pillar Two. Many countries continue to announce changes in their tax laws and regulations based on the Pillar Two framework. While we continue to evaluate the impact of these legislative changes as additional guidance becomes available, uncertainty remains regarding the timing and interpretation by tax authorities in affected jurisdictions. These legislative changes are not expected to have a material impact in fiscal year 2025 but could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate, tax liabilities, and cash tax in future years. There has been increased focus from our stakeholders, including consumers, employees, investors, regulatory organizations and legislatures on corporate environmental, social, and governance ( ESG ) practices, including corporate practices related to the causes and impacts of climate change and corporate statements, practices or products related to a variety of social issues. We expect that stakeholder expectations and actions with respect to 47 Table of Contents ESG practices and social issues and regulatory requirements will continue to evolve rapidly, which may impact our reputation and financial results. Wholesaler/retailer dynamics and wholesale channels remain challenged by mixed growth prospects due to increased competition from e-commerce shopping, pricing transparency enabled by the proliferation of online technologies, and vertically-integrated specialty stores. Retailers, including our top customers, have in the past and may in the future decide to consolidate, undergo restructurings or rationalize their stores, which could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry our products. These factors contribute to a global market environment of intense competition, constant product innovation and continuing cost pressure, and combine with the continuing global economic conditions to create a challenging commercial and economic environment. We evaluate these factors as we develop and execute our strategies. For additional information regarding these risks, as well as other risks we face, see the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors . Seasonality of Sales We typically achieve our largest quarterly revenues in the fourth quarter. In fiscal year 2024, our net revenues in the first, second, third and fourth quarters represented 24%, 23%, 24% and 29%, respectively, of our total net revenues for the fiscal year. Fiscal year 2024 benefited from a 53rd week, which was included in the fourth quarter, impacting net revenues by approximately $85 million or 1.3%. In fiscal year 2023, our net revenues in the first, second, third and fourth quarters represented 27%, 22%, 24% and 27%, respectively, of our total net revenues for the fiscal year. We typically achieve a significant amount of revenues from our DTC channel on the Friday following Thanksgiving Day, which is commonly referred to as Black Friday. Due to the timing of our fiscal year end, a particular fiscal year might include one, two or no Black Fridays, which could impact our net revenues for the fiscal year. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 included one Black Friday. The level of our working capital reflects the seasonality of our business and varies throughout the fiscal year to support our seasonal and holiday revenue patterns as well as business trends. 48 Table of Contents Our Results for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Fiscal year 2024 benefited from a 53rd week, which was included in the fourth quarter, benefiting net revenues by approximately $85 million or 4.6% of fourth quarter net revenues. Net revenues. Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, consolidated net revenues increased 12.0% on a reported basis and 7.9% on an organic net revenues basis. Excluding the effects of currency, revenue growth was driven by DTC, which grew across our regions, and wholesale, which grew in Americas and Asia. Operating income . Compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, consolidated operating income increased 40.3% to $212.2 million from $151.2 million. The increase was due to higher revenue and gross margin in the current fiscal year partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses. Net income. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, consolidated net income of $182.6 million increased from $126.8 million. The increase was primarily due to higher revenue and gross profit, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. Adjusted EBIT. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, Adjusted EBIT of $246.8 million increased from $200.1 million. The increase was due to higher revenue and gross profit described above, partially offset by higher Adjusted SG&A. Adjusted net income. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, Adjusted net income of $202.2 million increased from $178.6 million. The increase was primarily due to the higher Adjusted EBIT described above. Diluted earnings per share. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, diluted earnings per share of $0.46 increased from $0.32 due to higher net income described above. Adjusted diluted earnings per share. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.50 increased from $0.44 mainly due to the increase in Adjusted net income described above. Currency translation did not have a significant impact on Adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our Fiscal Year 2024 Results Net revenues. Compared to fiscal year 2023, consolidated net revenues increased 2.9% on a reported basis and 3.2% on an organic net revenues basis. The increase was driven by growth in DTC, which grew across our regions. The growth was partially offset by a decline in wholesale. Operating income . Compared to fiscal year 2023, consolidated operating income decreased to $264.1 million from $353.3 million primarily due to higher SG&A expenses, restructuring charges, and goodwill and other intangible impairment charges in the current fiscal year. Net income. Compared to fiscal year 2023, consolidated net income decreased to $210.6 million from $249.6 million. The decrease was due to lower operating income described above. Adjusted EBIT. Compared to fiscal year 2023, Adjusted EBIT of $649.9 million increased from $554.8 million primarily due to higher revenue and gross profit, partially offset by higher Adjusted SG&A expenses, driven by selling expenses in support of our DTC business. Adjusted EBIT margin was 10.2%, 120 basis points higher than the prior fiscal year on a reported basis and 130 basis points higher on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted net income. Compared to fiscal year 2023, Adjusted net income increased to $502.7 million from $440.7 million. The increase was primarily due to higher Adjusted EBIT described above. Diluted earnings per share. Compared to fiscal year 2023, diluted earnings per share of $0.52 decreased from $0.62 mainly due to the lower net income described above. Adjusted diluted earnings per share. Compared to fiscal year 2023, Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.25 increased from $1.10 due to the lower Adjusted net income described above. Currency translation unfavorably affected Adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.02.

We use a 52- or 53-week fiscal year, with each fiscal year ending on the Sunday that is closest to November 30 of that year. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries have fiscal years ending November 30. Each fiscal year generally consists of four 13-week quarters, with each quarter ending on the Sunday that is closest to the last day of the last month of that quarter. Fiscal year 2024 was a 53-week year, ending on December 1, 2024, and 2023 was a 52-week year ending November 26, 2023. Each quarter of fiscal years 2024 and 2023 consisted of 13 weeks with the exception of the fourth quarter of 2024 which consisted of 14 weeks. Segments . Our Levi's Brands business, which includes Levi's , Levi Strauss Signature and Denizen brands, is defined by geographical regions into three segments: Americas, Europe and Asia. Our Dockers and Beyond Yoga businesses are managed separately and do not meet the quantitative thresholds of a reportable operating segment and are reported in our financial statements under the caption of Other Brands . Effective in the second quarter of 2024, Dockers and Beyond Yoga businesses are disclosed as separate lines under the caption Other Brands to increase transparency of performance. Prior periods were adjusted to reflect the change. Classification . Our classification of certain significant revenues and expenses reflects the following: Net revenues comprise net sales and licensing revenues. Net sales include sales of products to wholesale customers, including franchised stores, and direct sales to consumers at our company-operated stores and shop-in-shops located within department stores and other third-party locations, as well as company-operated e-commerce sites. Net revenues are recorded net of discounts, allowances for estimated returns and retailer promotions and other incentives. Licensing revenues, which include revenues from the use of our trademarks in connection with the manufacturing, advertising and distribution of trademarked products by third-party licensees, are earned and recognized as products are sold by licensees based on royalty rates as set forth in the applicable licensing agreements. Cost of goods sold primarily comprises product costs, labor and related overhead, sourcing costs, inbound freight, internal transfers and the cost of operating our manufacturing facilities, including the related depreciation expense. On both a reported and constant-currency basis, cost of goods sold reflects the transactional currency impact resulting from the purchase of products in a currency other than the functional currency. Selling expenses reflected in SG&A expenses include, among other things, all occupancy costs and depreciation associated with our company-operated stores and commissions associated with our company-operated shop-in-shops, as well as costs associated with our e-commerce operations. We reflect substantially all distribution costs in SG&A expenses, for both our DTC and wholesale channels, including costs related to receiving and inspection at distribution centers, warehousing, shipping to our customers, handling, and certain other activities associated with our distribution network. 50 Table of Contents Results of Operations A discussion regarding our results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is presented below.

Fiscal year 2024 benefited from a 53rd week, impacting net revenues by approximately $85 million, or 1.3%. Americas . Net revenues in our Americas segment increased on both reported and organic net revenues basis, with currency affecting net revenues unfavorably by approximately $14 million. Organic net revenues increased as a result of higher revenue in our DTC channel, partially offset by lower revenue in our wholesale channel. The increase in DTC channel revenues was driven by both strong performance and store expansion in our company-operated stores, due to higher traffic, an increase in units sold, and sales from an additional week in fiscal year 2024. There were 46 more stores in operation as of December 1, 2024, as compared to November 26, 2023. E-commerce revenue increased primarily from higher traffic and conversion. The decrease in wholesale channel revenue was driven by lower units sold and the exit of our Denizen business of $53 million. 52 Table of Contents Europe . Net revenues in Europe increased on both a reported and organic net revenues basis, with currency translation affecting net revenues favorably by approximately $8 million. Excluding the effects of currency, net revenues increased due to growth in our DTC channel due to expansion in our company-operated stores and higher sales from an additional week in fiscal year 2024. There were 8 more stores in operation as of December 1, 2024, as compared to November 26, 2023. E-commerce revenues increased due to higher online traffic. The increase in DTC channel revenues was partially offset by a decrease in wholesale channel revenues due to lower volumes, as well as the exit from Russia, which included wholesale revenues of approximately $8 million in the prior fiscal year. Asia . Net revenues in Asia increased on both reported and organic net revenues basis, with currency translation affecting net revenues unfavorably by approximately $37 million. Excluding the effects of currency, net revenues increased in 2024 in both our DTC and wholesale channels. In our DTC channel, revenues increased due to strong performance in our company-operated stores as a result of higher selling prices, and strong performance in our e-commerce as a result of higher online traffic. Additionally, store expansion attributed to revenue growth, as there were 40 more stores in operation as of December 1, 2024, as compared to November 26, 2023. Weak store performance in China resulting from lower traffic and lower units sold partially offset these increases. Wholesale channel revenues increased due to higher volume and higher average selling prices, particularly in India and Turkey, partially offset by lower units sold in China. Other Brands. Dockers . Net revenues in Dockers decreased on a reported and organic net revenues basis, with currency affecting net revenues unfavorably by approximately $4 million. Excluding the effects of currency, net revenues decreased in 2024 primarily due to lower volume in the U.S. wholesale channel, partially offset by expansion in our DTC channel. Beyond Yoga . Net revenues in Beyond Yoga increased on a reported and organic net revenues basis. Net revenues increased in 2024 primarily due to growth in e-commerce and store expansion. Wholesale channel growth was primarily due to higher volume. Net revenues by channel Wholesale . On both a reported and organic net revenues basis, net revenues in our wholesale channel decreased, with currency translation affecting net revenues unfavorably by approximately $19 million. The decrease was primarily driven by the exit of the Denizen brand, which contributed approximately $53 million to the decline, and lower volumes, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. Additionally, the impact of the exit of the Russia business contributed $8 million to the decline. DTC (Direct to Consumer) . Net revenues in our DTC channel increased on both a reported and organic net revenues basis, with currency translation affecting net revenues unfavorably by approximately $28 million. The increase was driven by strong performance and expansion in our company-operated stores, as well as e-commerce, and included more sales at full price without discounts or promotions. Additionally, fiscal year 2024 included a 53rd week which resulted in higher sales compared to 2023. Our U.S. DTC business grew 13%. As a percentage of net revenues, DTC comprised 46% of total net revenues. Levi Brands net revenues Levi . Net revenues for the Levi brand increased on both a reported and organic net revenues basis, with currency translation affecting net revenues unfavorably by approximately $43 million. The increase was a result of higher revenue in our DTC channel, due to improved store performance and store expansion, and higher e-commerce traffic, partially offset by a decrease in wholesale revenues, primarily in Europe, due to lower volume.

Corporate expenses . Currency translation did not have a significant impact for fiscal year 2024. Corporate expenses represent costs that management does not attribute to any of our operating segments. Included in corporate expenses are certain impairment charges, acquisition related charges and other corporate staff costs. Corporate expenses also include costs associated with our global inventory sourcing organization which are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin. The increase in corporate expenses for the year ended December 1, 2024 is primarily due to restructuring related expenses, mostly consulting fees, of $54.3 million, in connection with Project Fuel and additional funding of employee incentive compensation, which increased $12.9 million as compared to the prior fiscal year. We also recognized $11.1 million of impairments related to discontinued technology projects during the year ended December 1, 2024 compared with $49.3 million in charges related to the impairment of capitalized internal-use software, net of a $3.9 million gain on the early termination of store leases related to the Russia-Ukraine war during the year ended November 26, 2023. Operating margin . Currency translation unfavorably affected total operating margin by approximately 10 basis points as compared to the prior year. Compared to fiscal year 2023, consolidated operating income decreased 25.2% to $264.1 million from $353.3 million due to higher gross margin being more than offset by SG&A expenses in the current fiscal year. Interest expense Interest expense was $41.8 million for the year ended December 1, 2024, as compared to $45.9 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease is primarily due to the $200.0 million revolving credit facility paid off in 2023. Our weighted-average interest rate on average borrowings outstanding for fiscal year 2024 was 4.01%, as compared to 4.20% for fiscal year 2023. Other (expense) income, net Other (expense) income, net, primarily consists of foreign exchange management activities and transactions. For the years ended December 1, 2024 and November 26, 2023, we recorded net other expenses of $3.3 million and $42.2 million, respectively. The net expense recognized in fiscal year 2024 was primarily due to $21.9 million of losses on forward foreign exchange contracts, partially offset by $11.8 million of marketable securities gains and $8.2 million of foreign currency transaction gains. The prior fiscal year included $47.8 million of foreign currency transaction losses and the recognition of a pension settlement loss of $19.0 million, partially offset by $24.7 million of gains on forward foreign exchange contracts. 57 Table of Contents Income tax expense Income tax expense was $8.4 million for the year ended December 1, 2024, compared to $15.6 million for the prior fiscal year. Our effective income tax rate was 3.8% for the year ended December 1, 2024, compared to 5.9% for the prior fiscal year. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily driven by an international intellectual property transaction which benefited fiscal year 2024, partially offset by the reduced FDII benefit in the current year. During 2024, the Company completed an intercompany sale of intellectual property between entities based in different tax jurisdictions resulting in net tax benefits of $46.4 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity outlook We believe we will have adequate liquidity over the next 12 months and in the longer term to operate our business and to meet our cash requirements. Over the long term, we plan to deploy capital across all four of our capital allocation priorities: (1) to reinvest 3.5-4% of our revenue in capital, including high growth investment opportunities and initiatives, to grow our business organically, (2) to return capital to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends, with a dividend payout ratio target of 25-35% of net income; (3) to pursue high return on investment acquisitions, both organic and inorganic, that support our current strategies; and (4) to repurchase shares with the goal of offsetting dilution or opportunistic buybacks or both, while maintaining an adequate public float of our shares. Our aim is to return 55-65% of our Adjusted free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We continue to concentrate our capital investments in new stores, distribution capacity and technology to accelerate the profitable growth of our business. For more information on our calculation of Adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Future determinations regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our results of operations, payout ratio, capital requirements, financial condition, prospects, contractual arrangements, any limitations on payment of dividends present in our current and future debt agreements and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Cash sources We have historically relied primarily on cash flows from operations, borrowings under credit facilities, issuances of notes and other forms of debt financing. We regularly explore financing and debt reduction alternatives, including new credit agreements, unsecured and secured note issuances, equity financing, equipment and real estate financing, securitizations and asset sales. Our Credit Agreement provides for an asset-based, senior secured revolving credit facility ( Credit Facility ), in which the borrowing availability is primarily based on the value of our U.S. Levi trademarks and the levels of accounts receivable and inventory in the United States and Canada. The maximum availability under the facility is $1.0 billion, of which $950.0 million is available to us for revolving loans in U.S. Dollars and $50.0 million is available to us for revolving loans either in U.S. Dollars or Canadian Dollars. The facility has an accordion feature which, if exercised, can expand the maximum availability to $1.15 billion. As of December 1, 2024, we did not have any borrowings under the Credit Facility. Unused availability under the facility was $803.0 million, and our total availability of $823.8 million (based on collateral levels as defined by the agreement less outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility) was reduced by $20.8 million from other credit-related instruments. We also had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $690.0 million resulting in a total liquidity position (unused availability and cash and cash equivalents) of approximately $1.5 billion. Of our $690.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $363.8 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. Cash uses Our principal cash requirements include working capital, capital expenditures, payments of principal and interest on our debt, payments of taxes, contributions to our pension plans and payments for postretirement health benefit plans, payment of taxes resulting from net settlement of shares issued under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended to date ("2016 Plan"), and our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan as amended to date ( 2019 Plan ), and, if market conditions warrant, occasional investments in, or acquisitions of, business ventures. In addition, we regularly evaluate our ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock, all consistent with the terms of our debt agreements. 58 Table of Contents On May 31, 2022, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $750 million of our Class A common stock. The previously approved $200 million share repurchase program was completed as of the end of the second quarter of 2022. During fiscal 2024, 4.8 million shares were repurchased for $90.0 million, plus broker's commissions, in the open market. During fiscal 2023, 0.5 million shares were repurchased for $8.1 million, plus broker's commissions, in the open market. In January 2025, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.13 per share to holders of record of its Class A and Class B common stock at the close of business on February 12, 2025, for a total quarterly dividend of approximately $51 million. In the absence of a dividend policy, we will continue to evaluate and consider declaration of dividends on a quarterly basis and the expectation is that they will grow in line with net income. Cash requirements for fiscal 2025 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in new stores, distribution capacity and technology. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 are expected to be approximately $260 million. Additionally, we have commitments of approximately $290 million for sponsorship, naming rights and related benefits with respect to the Levi's Stadium through 2043. Based on the fair value of our capital stock and the number of shares outstanding as of December 1, 2024, future payments related to shares surrendered for employee tax withholding on the exercise or vesting of outstanding equity awards could range up to approximately $30 million, which could become payable in 2025. These estimates and projections are based upon assumptions that are inherently subject to significant economic, competitive, legislative and other uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, our actual expenditures and liabilities may be materially higher or lower than the estimates and projections reflected. The inclusion of these projections and estimates should not be regarded as a representation by us that the estimates will prove to be correct. Cash flows The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our consolidated statements of cash flows: Year Ended December 1, 2024 November 26, 2023 (Dollars in millions) Cash provided by operating activities $ 898.4 $ 435.5 Cash used for investing activities (281.1) (240.7) Cash used for financing activities (319.3) (214.1) Cash and cash equivalents as of fiscal year end 690.0 398.8 Cash flows from operating activities Cash provided by operating activities was $898.4 million for fiscal year 2024, as compared to $435.5 million for fiscal year 2023. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2024 is primarily driven by higher collections on trade receivables, lower spending on inventory and employee incentives, partially offset by higher spending on SG&A expenses. In addition, the Company has received payments of approximately $87.1 million associated with the transition of our distribution center to a third-party logistics provider during fiscal year 2024. Cash flows from investing activities Cash used for investing activities was $281.1 million for fiscal year 2024, as compared to $240.7 million for fiscal year 2023. The increase in cash used for investing activities is due to lower proceeds from short-term investments, higher payments on settlement of forward foreign exchange contracts, and higher payments incurred for business acquisitions during fiscal year 2024, partially offset by lower payments for capital expenditures. See Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report regarding our acquisition of Expofaro S.A.S. Cash flows from financing activities Cash used for financing activities was $319.3 million for fiscal year 2024, as compared to $214.1 million for fiscal year 2023. Cash used in 2024 primarily reflects dividend payments of $198.5 million and repurchase of common stock of $90.1 million. Cash used in fiscal year 2023 primarily reflects dividend payments of $190.5 million. 59 Table of Contents Indebtedness The borrower of substantially all of our debt is Levi Strauss & Co., the parent and U.S. operating company. Of our total debt of $1.0 billion as of December 1, 2024, 100% was fixed-rate debt, net of capitalized debt issuance costs. As of December 1, 2024, our required aggregate debt principal payments of $1.0 billion begin in 2027. Short-term borrowings of $5.5 million at various foreign subsidiaries were expected to be either paid over the next 12 months or refinanced at the end of their applicable terms. Our long-term debt agreements contain customary covenants restricting our activities as well as those of our subsidiaries. We were in compliance with all of these covenants as of December 1, 2024. 60 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A Margin, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Margin, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share We define the following non-GAAP measures as follows: Most comparable GAAP measure Non-GAAP measure Non-GAAP measure definition Selling, general and administration ( SG&A ) expenses Adjusted SG&A SG&A expenses excluding acquisition and integration related charges, property, plant, and equipment, right-of-use asset impairment, and early lease terminations, net and restructuring related charges, severance and other, net.

Net income Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBIT excluding depreciation and amortization expense Net income margin Adjusted net income margin Adjusted net income as a percentage of net revenues Diluted earnings per share Adjusted diluted earnings per share Adjusted net income per weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding We believe Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income margin and Adjusted diluted earnings per share are useful to investors because they help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by certain expenses that we include in calculating net income but that can vary from company to company depending on its financing, capital structure and the method by which its assets were acquired, and can also vary significantly from period to period. Our management also uses Adjusted EBIT in conjunction with other GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including as a measure of our core operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income margin and Adjusted diluted earnings per share have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include: Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect income tax payments that reduce cash available to us; Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness, which reduces cash available to us; Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin and Adjusted EBITDA exclude other expense, net, which includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on our forward foreign exchange contracts and transaction gains and losses on our foreign exchange balances, although these items affect the amount and timing of cash available to us when these gains and losses are realized; 61 Table of Contents all of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude acquisition and integration charges, impairment charges and early terminations and restructuring charges, net and restructuring related charges, severance and other, net which can affect our current and future cash requirements; all of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain other SG&A expense items, which include severance, transaction and deal related costs, including acquisition and integration costs which can affect our current and future cash requirements; all of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain other SG&A expense items, which include non-cash property and equipment and right-of-use asset impairment charges. The store-related assets being impaired may still be in use, resulting in lower recurring expenses of depreciation of property and equipment and right-of-use asset amortization. Although property and equipment impairment charges are non-cash expenses, the assets being impaired may need to be replaced in the future which can affect our current and future cash requirements; the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculations of all of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from all of these non-GAAP financial measures or similarly titled measures; Adjusted EBITDA excludes the recurring, non-cash expenses of depreciation of property and equipment and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated may need to be replaced in the future; and Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income margin and Adjusted diluted earnings per share do not include all of the effects of income taxes and changes in income taxes reflected in net income. Because of these limitations, all of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with net income and other operating and financial performance measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.

We believe Adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available after capital expenditures for operational expenses and investment in our business. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest in future growth and return capital to stockholders. Our use of Adjusted free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results under GAAP. First, Adjusted free cash flow is not a substitute for net cash flow from operating activities. Second, other companies may calculate Adjusted free cash flow or similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of Adjusted free cash flow as a tool for comparison. Additionally, the utility of Adjusted free cash flow is further limited as it does not reflect our future contractual commitments and does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. Because of these and other limitations, Adjusted free cash flow should be considered along with net cash flow from operating activities and other comparable financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted free cash flow for each of the periods presented. Year Ended December 1, 2024 November 26, 2023 (Dollars in millions) Most comparable GAAP measure: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 898.4 $ 435.5 Net cash used for investing activities (281.1) (240.7) Net cash used for financing activities (319.3) (214.1) Non-GAAP measure: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 898.4 $ 435.5 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (227.5) (313.6) Adjusted free cash flow $ 670.9 $ 121.9 Organic Net Revenues and Constant-Currency: We report our net revenues in accordance with GAAP, as well as on an organic net revenues basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our revenues which excludes the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates from the change in reported net revenues, net revenues derived from business acquisitions or divestitures impacting the previous 12 months of the reporting date and the estimated impact of any 53rd week. We report our operating results in accordance with GAAP, as well as on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. The term foreign currency exchange rates refers to the exchange rates we use to translate our operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars. Because we are a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on our reported results. In general, our reported financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business. References to our operating results on a constant-currency basis mean our operating results without the impact of foreign currency translation fluctuations. We calculate constant-currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign currency exchange rates for the current period. Our constant-currency results do not eliminate the transaction currency impact, which primarily includes the realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized from the measurement and remeasurement of purchases and sales of products in a currency other than the functional currency and of forward foreign exchange contracts. We believe disclosure of organic net revenues and Adjusted EBIT constant-currency, Adjusted EBIT Margin constant-currency and Adjusted Net Income constant-currency results is helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period 67 Table of Contents comparisons of our results by increasing the transparency of our underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. However, organic net revenues and constant-currency results are non-GAAP financial measures and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have limitations in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. 68 Table of Contents Organic Net Revenues: The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by segment on an organic net revenues basis for each of the periods presented.

Critical accounting estimates refers to those assumptions and approximations that may have a material impact on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes due to the level of subjectivity involved in developing the estimate. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting estimates, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in such estimates, based on newly available information, or different assumptions or conditions, may affect amounts reported in future periods. We summarize our critical accounting estimates and assumptions below. Sales returns and allowances . Revenue is recorded net of an allowance for estimated returns, discounts and retailer promotions and other similar incentives. We recognize allowances for estimated returns in the period in which the related sale is recorded. These estimates are calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information regarding retailer inventory levels. In addition, allowances for estimated returns may be established for significant future known or anticipated events. The types of known or anticipated events that are considered, and will continue to be considered, include the financial condition of our customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products. We recognize allowances for estimated discounts, retailer promotions and other similar incentives at the later of the period in which the related sale is recorded or the period in which the sales incentive is offered to the customer. These estimates are calculated using the most likely amount method. Under this method, certain forms of variable consideration are based on expected sell-through results, which requires subjective estimates. These estimates are supported by historical results as well as specific customer and product-specific facts and circumstances related to the current period. The determination of sales allowances is considered a critical accounting estimate because significant judgment is required to estimate sales volume and demand. Actual allowances may differ from estimates due to changes in sales volume based on wholesale customer or consumer demand and changes in customer and product-specific circumstances. Inventory valuation. We value inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. In determining inventory net realizable value, substantial consideration is given to the expected product selling price. We estimate expected selling prices based on our historical recovery rates for sale of slow-moving and obsolete inventory and other factors, such as market conditions, expected channel of disposition, and current consumer preferences. We record an adjustment to inventory when future estimated selling price is less than cost. The determination of inventory net realizable value is considered a critical accounting estimate because significant judgment is required to evaluate whether there will be future demand for inventories held as well as the prices at which our wholesale customers and retail consumers are willing to pay for these inventories. Estimates may differ from actual results due to changes in resale or market value, avenues of disposition, consumer and retailer preferences and economic conditions. Impairment . Upon acquisition, we estimate and record the fair value of purchased intangible assets, which primarily consist of trademarks and customer relationships. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, including trademark intangible assets, are not amortized, but are assessed for impairment at least annually. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable. We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Annual testing is performed in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for all indefinite-lived assets and reporting units except for the Beyond Yoga indefinite-lived assets and reporting unit, which is performed in the third quarter. When testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit or the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. For goodwill, if necessary, we perform a single step quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, if necessary, we perform a quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the asset with the asset's carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. For fiscal 2024, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for the goodwill in certain of our reporting units and 74 Table of Contents certain indefinite-lived intangible assets. This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors, as of the test date, to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value. For our other reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including Beyond Yoga , a quantitative assessment was performed. Determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset is based on management assessment, using industry accepted valuation models. Third-party valuation specialists are engaged when necessary. This determination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which may include revenue growth rates, profit margins, operating expenses, capital expenditures, terminal value, a royalty rate and a discount rate. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the amount of any such charge. Furthermore, estimating the fair value requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding not only our future plans, but industry and other market conditions outside of our control. Given the uncertainty of global economic conditions, those estimates could be significantly different than future performance. The Beyond Yoga reporting unit assets and liabilities, including the intangible assets, were established in the fourth quarter of 2021 at the fair value on the acquisition date. Based on the annual assessment in 2024, the carrying values of the reporting unit, trademark intangible asset, and customer relationship intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair values, resulting in impairment charges being taken for the carrying values of the reporting unit, trademark intangible asset, and customer relationship intangible assets to approximate their respective approximate fair values. As our long-term strategies change, planned business performance expectations are not met over time, or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of the reporting unit, the intangible assets, or both might continue to decline and lead to additional impairment charges in the future. Several factors could impact the Beyond Yoga brand's ability to achieve expected future cash flows, including the success of retail store and international expansion, store and e-commerce productivity, the impact of promotional activity, continued economic volatility and potential operational challenges related to macroeconomic factors and other strategic initiatives to drive increased profitability. Given that carrying value approximates fair value, if profitability trends decline over time from those that are expected, it is possible that an interim test, or our annual impairment test, could result in additional impairment of the related assets. Our other reporting units and intangible assets, primarily related to the 1985 acquisition of the Company by Levi Strauss Associates Inc., had substantial fair value in excess of carrying value. For further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for goodwill and intangible assets, see Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies - Goodwill and Intangible Assets. For further discussion of the impairment charges taken in 2023, see Note 3: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Income tax. Significant judgment is required in determining our global income tax provision, therefore, the determination of our income tax provision is considered a critical accounting estimate. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise from examinations in various jurisdictions and assumptions and estimates used in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Significant judgments are required in order to determine the realizability of deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the existence of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Changes in the expectations regarding the realization of deferred tax assets could materially impact income tax expense in future periods. We continuously review issues raised in connection with all ongoing examinations and open tax years to evaluate the adequacy of our tax liabilities. We evaluate uncertain tax positions under a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the uncertain tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on its technical merits. The second step is, for those positions that meet the recognition criteria, to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than fifty percent likely of being realized. We believe our recorded tax liabilities are adequate to cover all open tax years based on our assessment. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and involves significant judgments about future events. To the extent that our view as to the outcome of these matters changes, we will adjust income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. We classify interest and penalties related to income taxes as income tax expense. 75 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report for recently issued accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and expected impact to our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 76 Table of Contents
