For the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 Overview This overview of management discussion and analysis highlights selected information in this document and may not contain all the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources, and critical accounting estimates, you should carefully read this entire document. These have an impact on the Company consolidated financial condition and results of consolidated operations. Net income was $78.9 million, $68.9 million, and $73.0 million and diluted earnings per share were $3.30, $3.15, and $3.60 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The following table shows the Company annualized performance ratios for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022: 2024 2023 2022 Return on average assets 1.04 % 0.97 % 1.11 % Return on average common equity 9.67 % 10.10 % 11.38 % Average common equity to average assets (non-GAAP) 10.76 % 9.61 % 9.77 % Total assets at December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $7.52 billion, $7.59 billion, and $6.74 billion, respectively. Net loan balances increased to $5.60 billion at December 31, 2024, from $5.51 billion at December 31, 2023, and from $4.77 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in 2024 was primarily due to organic growth within the established footprint. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to approximately $730.2 million of gross loans acquired, after purchase accounting adjustments, from Blackhawk Bank. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to approximately $418.5 million of loans acquired from Jefferson Bank. Total deposit balances decreased to $6.06 billion at December 31, 2024 from $6.12 billion at December 31, 2023 which was an increase from $5.26 billion at December 31, 2022. The decrease in 2024 was due primarily to a reduction in brokered CDs and purchased CDs as part of the Company's strategy to reduce its cost of funds. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to $1.19 billion acquired from Blackhawk Bank. Net interest margin (tax effected), defined as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets, was 3.34% for 2024, 3.05% for 2023 and 3.13% for 2022. The increase in 2024 was primarily due to repricing of earning assets catching up to the increased cost of funding experience in 2023. The decrease in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in rates on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. Net interest income increased to $228.7 million in 2024 from $193.5 million in 2023 and $184.3 million in 2022. During 2024, the increase in net interest income was primarily due to the Blackhawk Bank acquisition being present for a full calendar year and the previously mentioned explanation for the increase in net interest margin (tax effected). During 2023, the increase in net interest income was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. Non-interest income increased to $96.3 million in 2024 compared to $86.8 million in 2023 and $74.7 million in 2022. The increase in 2024 was primarily due to the Blackhawk Bank acquisition being present for a full calendar year and the increase in insurance commissions due to the acquisition of Mid Rivers Insurance Group in 2024. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank and an increase in insurance revenues. Non-interest expenses increased to $215.0 million in 2024 compared to $185.7 million in 2023, and $162.9 million in 2022. The increase in 2024 is primarily due to increased employees and locations from the Blackhawk Bank acquisition being present for a full calendar year. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank and nonrecurring costs tied to the acquisition and integration. 17 Following is a summary of the factors that contributed to the changes in net income (in thousands): 2024 vs 2023 2023 vs 2022 Net interest income $ 35,265 $ 9,186 Provision for credit losses 469 (1,298 ) Other income, including securities transactions 9,500 12,104 Other expenses (29,243 ) (22,879 ) Income taxes (6,028 ) (1,130 ) Increase (decrease) in net income $ 9,963 $ (4,017 ) Credit quality is an area of importance to the Company. Year-end total nonperforming loans were $29.8 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $20.1 million at December 31, 2023, and $19.2 million at December 31, 2022. Repossessed Assets balances totaled $2.2 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $1.2 million at December 31, 2023, and $4.4 million at December 31, 2022. The Company provision for credit losses was $5.6 million for 2024, compared to $6.1 million for 2023, and $4.8 million for 2022. The decrease of provision expense in 2024 was primarily due to the provision requirements in 2023 for the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. The increase in provision expense for 2023 was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. The Company capital position remains strong and the Company has consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios above the well-capitalized standards. The Company Tier 1 capital ratio to risk weighted assets ratio at December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was 12.82%, 12.02%, and 12.40%, respectively. The Company total capital to risk weighted assets ratio at December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was 15.37%, 14.84% and 15.20%, respectively. The increase in 2024 was primarily due to net income of the Company exceeding dividends paid to shareholders. The decrease in 2023 was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. The Company liquidity position remains sufficient to fund operations and meet the requirements of borrowers, depositors, and creditors. The Company maintains various sources of liquidity to fund its cash needs. See Liquidity herein for a full listing of its sources and anticipated significant contractual obligations. The Company enters into financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include lines of credit, letters of credit and other commitments to extend credit. The total outstanding commitments at December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.2 billion, respectively. See Note 17 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities herein for further information. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates The Company has established various accounting policies that govern the application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in the preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements. The significant accounting policies of the Company are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities; management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from these judgments and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the Company. Investment in Debt and Equity Securities. The Company classifies its investments in debt securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are recorded at amortized cost. Available-for-sale and equity securities are carried at fair value. Due to the subjective nature of the valuation process, it is possible that the actual fair values of these investments could differ from the estimated amounts, thereby affecting the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. If the estimated value of investments is less than the cost or amortized cost, the Company evaluates whether an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. If such an event or change has occurred and the Company determines that the impairment is other-than-temporary, a further determination is made as to the portion of impairment that is related to credit loss. The impairment of the investment that is related to the credit loss is expensed in the period in which the event or change occurred. The remainder of the impairment is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Loans. Loans are reported at amortized cost. Amortized cost is the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase discounts and premiums, fair value hedge accounting adjustments and deferred loan fees and costs. Accrued interest is reported separately and is included in interest receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans. The Company believes the allowance for credit losses for loans is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. The allowance for credit losses for loans represents the best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. An estimate of potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio are determined and an allowance for those losses is established by considering factors including historical loss rates, expected cash flows and estimated collateral values. In assessing these factors, the Company uses relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis for non-impaired loans with similar risk characteristics. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimate of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for relevant factors to each pool including merger and acquisition activity, economic conditions, changes in policies, procedures and underwriting, and concentrations. The Company estimates the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses for impaired loans by evaluating them separately. A specific allowance is assigned to an impaired loan when expected cash flows or collateral are less than the carrying amount of the loan. Allowance for Credit Losses - Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period that the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses 18 on off-balance sheet credit exposures is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred Income Tax Assets/Liabilities. The Company net deferred income tax asset arises from differences in the dates that items of income and expense enter into our reported income and taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for these items as they arise. From an accounting standpoint, deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they are realizable based on the historical level of taxable income, estimates of future taxable income and the reversals of deferred tax liabilities. In most cases, the realization of the deferred tax asset is based on future profitability. If the Company were to experience net operating losses for tax purposes in a future period, the realization of deferred tax assets would be evaluated for a potential valuation reserve. Additionally, the Company reviews its uncertain tax positions annually. An uncertain tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is "more likely than not" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be recognized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the "more likely than not" test, no tax benefit is recorded. A significant amount of judgment is applied to determine both whether the tax position meets the "more likely than not" test as well as to determine the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be recognized. Differences between the position taken by management and that of taxing authorities could result in a reduction of a tax benefit or increase to tax liability, which could adversely affect future income tax expense. Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Core deposit and customer relationships, which are intangible assets with a finite life, are recorded on the Company consolidated balance sheets. These intangible assets were capitalized as a result of past acquisitions and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of up to 15 years. Core deposit intangible assets, with finite lives will be tested for impairment when changes in events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Core deposit intangible assets were tested for impairment during 2024 as part of the goodwill impairment test and no impairment was deemed necessary. As a result of the Company acquisition activity, goodwill, an intangible asset with an indefinite life, is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually, unless there are factors present that indicate a potential impairment, in which case, the goodwill impairment test is performed more frequently than annually. Fair Value Measurements. The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The Company estimates the fair value of a financial instrument using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, the Company estimates fair value. The Company valuation methods consider factors such as liquidity and concentration concerns. Other factors such as model assumptions, market dislocations, and unexpected correlations can affect estimates of fair value. Imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded. ASC 820 establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of financial instruments that considers the attributes specific to particular assets or liabilities and establishes a three-level hierarchy for determining fair value based on the transparency of inputs to each valuation as of the fair value measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: Level 1 quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices of identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. At the end of each quarter, the Company assesses the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured. From time to time, assets or liabilities may be transferred within hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date. Transfers into or out of hierarchy levels are based upon the fair value at the beginning of the reporting period. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy can be found in Note 11 Disclosures of Fair Values of Financial Instruments. Results of Operations Net Interest Income The largest source of operating revenue for the Company is net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between total interest income earned on earning assets and total interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The amount of interest income is dependent upon many factors, including the volume and mix of earning assets, the general level of interest rates and the dynamics of changes in interest rates. The cost of funds necessary to support earning assets varies with the volume and mix of interest-bearing liabilities and the rates paid to attract and retain such funds. Net interest income is the excess of interest received from earning assets over interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. For analytical purposes, net interest income is presented on a full tax equivalent (TE) basis in the table that follows. The federal statutory rate in effect of 21% was used for all years. The TE analysis portrays the income tax benefits associated with the tax-exempt assets. The year-to-date net yield on interest-earning assets excluding the TE adjustments of $3.1 million, $3.1 million, and $3.2 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, were 3.28%, 3.00%, and 3.08% at December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The Company 19 average balances, fully tax equivalent interest income and interest expense, and rates earned or paid for major balance sheet categories are set forth in the following table (dollars in thousands): Year Ended Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Average Average Average Average Average Average Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Assets Interest-bearing deposits $ 145,502 $ 7,900 5.42 % $ 82,640 $ 5,107 6.18 % $ 56,517 $ 492 0.87 % Federal funds sold 297 53 18.00 % 8,299 419 5.05 % 5,772 113 1.96 % Certificates of deposit investments 3,053 144 4.71 % 1,822 98 5.37 % 1,756 37 2.10 % Investment securities Taxable 879,221 21,510 2.42 % 964,898 24,307 2.52 % 1,053,511 20,595 1.95 % Tax-exempt (Municipals)(TE)(1) 273,995 9,574 3.49 % 276,417 9,889 3.58 % 328,832 11,121 3.38 % Loans (TE)(1)(2)(3) 5,558,527 321,498 5.78 % 5,079,949 263,406 5.19 % 4,518,566 186,697 4.13 % Total earning assets 6,860,595 360,679 5.25 % 6,414,025 303,226 4.73 % 5,964,954 219,055 3.67 % Cash and due from banks 98,932 133,237 123,306 Premises and equipment 101,529 94,897 88,744 Other assets 603,998 520,944 439,545 Allowance for credit losses (68,805 ) (62,878 ) (58,876 ) Total assets $ 7,596,249 $ 7,100,225 $ 6,557,673 Liabilities and stockholders' equity Deposits: Demand deposits, interest-bearing $ 3,040,397 67,999 2.24 % $ 2,618,452 47,939 1.83 % $ 2,598,480 13,709 0.53 % Savings deposits 675,622 810 0.12 % 663,760 739 0.11 % 666,334 570 0.09 % Time deposits 1,019,629 38,110 3.74 % 961,162 28,616 2.98 % 655,240 4,534 0.69 % Total interest-bearing deposits 4,735,648 106,919 2.26 % 4,243,374 77,294 1.82 % 3,920,054 18,813 0.48 % Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 221,789 6,448 2.91 % 225,307 6,565 2.91 % 202,242 1,795 0.89 % FHLB advances 239,949 8,673 3.61 % 462,197 16,779 3.63 % 276,401 6,184 2.24 % Federal funds purchased 1 % 192 10 5 % 481 9 1.87 % Subordinated debt 99,313 4,454 4.48 % 99,638 4,196 4.18 % 94,471 3,945 4.18 % Junior subordinated debentures 24,168 2,156 8.92 % 21,337 1,859 8.87 % 19,275 868 4.50 % Other debt 1 % % 14 % Total borrowings 585,220 21,732 3.71 % 808,671 29,409 3.64 % 592,884 12,801 2.16 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 5,320,868 128,651 2.42 % 5,052,045 106,703 2.11 % 4,512,938 31,614 0.70 % Demand deposits 1,407,537 1,312,023 1,356,912 Other liabilities 50,665 53,838 46,811 Stockholders equity 817,179 682,319 641,012 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 7,596,249 $ 7,100,225 $ 6,557,673 Net interest income $ 231,791 $ 196,523 $ 187,441 Net interest spread 2.83 % 2.62 % 2.97 % Impact of non-interest-bearing funds 0.51 % 0.43 % 0.16 % TE net yield on interest-earning assets 3.34 % 3.05 % 3.13 % (1) Tax-exempt income is shown on a fully tax equivalent basis.

The following table summarizes the approximate relative contribution of changes in average volume and interest rates to changes in net interest income for the past two years (in thousands): 2024 Compared to 2023 2023 Compared to 2022 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) Total Total Change Volume (1) Rate (1) Change Volume (1) Rate (1) Earning assets: Interest-bearing deposits $ 2,793 $ 3,486 $ (693 ) $ 4,615 $ 325 $ 4,290 Federal funds sold (366 ) (687 ) 321 306 67 239 Certificates of deposit investments 46 59 (13 ) 61 1 60 Investment securities: Taxable (3,034 ) (2,097 ) (937 ) 3,712 (1,854 ) 5,566 Tax-exempt (315 ) (86 ) (229 ) (1,232 ) (1,848 ) 616 Loans (2) 58,089 26,325 31,764 76,709 25,020 51,689 Total interest income 57,213 27,000 30,213 84,171 21,711 62,460 Interest-bearing liabilities: Deposits: Demand deposits, interest-bearing 20,060 8,392 11,668 34,230 107 34,123 Savings deposits 71 12 59 169 (1 ) 170 Time deposits 9,494 1,828 7,666 24,082 2,970 21,112 Total interest-bearing deposits 29,625 10,232 19,393 58,481 3,076 55,405 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (117 ) (117 ) 4,770 228 4,542 FHLB advances (8,106 ) (8,015 ) (91 ) 10,595 5,509 5,086 Federal funds purchased (9 ) (5 ) (4 ) 1 (7 ) 8 Subordinated debt 258 (14 ) 272 251 251 Junior subordinated debentures 297 251 46 991 82 909 Total borrowings (7,677 ) (7,900 ) 223 16,608 6,063 10,545 Total interest expense 21,948 2,332 19,616 75,089 9,139 65,950 Net interest income $ 35,265 $ 24,668 $ 10,597 $ 9,082 $ 12,572 $ (3,490 ) (1) Changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate. (2) Nonaccrual loans have been included in the average balances. Balances are net of unaccreted discount related to loans acquired. Net interest income on a tax-effected basis increased $35.3 million or 17.9% in 2024 compared to an increase of $9.1 million or 4.8% in 2023. Net interest income on a tax-effected basis increased primarily due to the growth in average earnings assets including loans and interest-bearing deposits. The tax-effected net interest margin increased primarily due to higher interest-bearing liability costs in 2023 being more than offset by the repricing of earning assets. In 2024, average earning assets increased by $446.6 million, or 7.0%, and average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $268.8 million or 5.3%. These increases were primarily due to assets and liabilities acquired from Blackhawk Bank being present for the entire calendar year. Changes in average balances are shown below: Average interest-bearing cash deposits held by the Company increased $62.9 million or 76.1% in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2023, average interest-bearing cash deposits held by the Company increased $26.1 million or 46.2% compared to 2022. Average federal funds sold decreased $8.0 million or 96.4% in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2023, average federal funds sold increased $2.5 million or 43.8% compared to 2022. Average certificates of deposit investments increased $1.2 million or 67.6% in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2023, average certificates of deposit investments increased $0.1 million or 3.8% compared to 2022. Average loans increased by $478.6 million or 9.4% in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2023, average loans increased by $561.4 million or 12.4% compared to 2022. Average securities decreased by $88.1 million or 7.1% in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2023, average securities decreased by $141.0 million or 10.2% compared to 2022. Average interest-bearing deposits increased by $492.3 million or 11.6% in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2023, average deposits increased by $323.3 million or 8.2% compared to 2022. 21 Average securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by $3.5 million or 1.60% in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2023, average securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased by $23.1 million or 11.4% compared to 2022. Average borrowings and other debt decreased by $219.9 million or 37.7% in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2023, average borrowings and other debt increased by $193.0 million or 49.4% compared to 2022. Net interest margin increased to 3.34% compared to 3.05% in 2023 and 3.13% in 2022. Asset yields increased by 52 basis points in 2024, and interest- bearing liabilities increased by 31 basis points. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses in 2024 was $5.6 million compared to $6.1 million in 2023 and $4.8 million in 2022. Nonperforming loans increased to $29.8 million at December 31, 2024 from $20.1 million at December 31, 2023 and $19.2 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease in provision expense in 2024 was primarily due to the required provision in 2023 tied to the Blackhawk Bank acquisition. The increase in provision expense in 2023 was primarily related to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. Net charge-offs were $4.1 million during 2024, $0.3 million during 2023 and $1.2 million during 2022.

Other Income An important source of the Company revenue is derived from other income. The following table sets forth the major components of other income for the last three years (in thousands): Change From Prior Year 2024 2023 2024 2023 2022 $ % $ % Wealth management revenues $ 22,818 $ 20,793 $ 22,492 $ 2,025 9.7 % $ (1,699 ) -7.6 % Insurance commissions 28,552 24,814 21,622 3,738 15.1 % 3,192 14.8 % Service charges 12,362 10,881 9,112 1,481 13.6 % 1,769 19.4 % Securities gains (losses), net (433 ) 3,383 33 (3,816 ) -112.8 % 3,350 10151.5 % Mortgage banking, net 3,957 2,282 1,190 1,675 73.4 % 1,092 91.8 % ATM / debit card revenue 16,807 14,347 12,422 2,460 17.1 % 1,925 15.5 % Bank owned life insurance 4,728 4,957 3,559 (229 ) -4.6 % 1,398 39.3 % Other income 7,495 5,329 4,252 2,166 40.6 % 1,077 25.3 % Total other income $ 96,286 $ 86,786 $ 74,682 $ 9,500 10.9 % $ 12,104 16.2 % Total non-interest income increased to $96.3 million in 2024 compared to $86.8 million in 2023 and $74.7 million in 2022. The primary reasons for the more significant year-to-year changes in other income components are as follows: Wealth management revenues increased in 2024 primarily due to growth in net brokerage fees and trust management fees. The decrease in 2023 was primarily due to lower commodity prices and higher interest rates resulting in less farm management income. Total assets under management were $6.4 billion at December 31, 2024 compared to $6.1 billion at December 31, 2023 and $5.3 billion at December 31, 2022.

Net securities losses in 2024 were $433,000 compared to gains of $3.4 million in 2023 and $33,000 in 2022. The loss in 2024 was due to balance sheet restructuring. The gain in 2023 were primarily due to securities sold soon after the close of the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. The increase in mortgage banking income during 2024 was primarily due to Blackhawk Bank being present the entire calendar year. Loans sold balances were as follows: $125.5 million (representing 821 loans) in 2024 $57.5 million (representing 413 loans) in 2023 $62.3 million (representing 422 loans) in 2022 First Mid Bank generally releases the servicing rights on loans sold into the secondary market. Revenue from ATMs and debit cards increased in 2024 primarily due to Blackhawk Bank being present the entire calendar year and in 2023 primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. Bank owned life insurance decreased during 2024 due to the lower interest rates during part of the year. The increase in 2023 was due to the addition of Blackhawk Bank and higher interest rates. 22 Other income increased during 2024 primarily due to Blackhawk Bank being present the entire calendar year. Other income increased during 2023 primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. Other Expense The major categories of other expense include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses and other operating expenses associated with day-to-day operations. The following table sets forth the major components of other expense for the last three years (dollars in thousands): Change From Prior Year 2024 2023 2024 2023 2022 $ % $ % Salaries and employee benefits $ 124,134 $ 104,962 $ 98,594 $ 19,172 18.3 % $ 6,368 6.5 % Net occupancy and equipment expense 30,407 26,946 24,257 3,461 12.8 % 2,689 11.1 % Net other real estate owned expense 411 1,862 330 (1,451 ) -77.9 % 1,532 464.2 % FDIC insurance expense 3,463 3,339 1,805 124 3.7 % 1,534 85.0 % Amortization of other intangible assets 13,556 9,127 6,290 4,429 48.5 % 2,837 45.1 % Stationery and supplies 1,885 1,346 1,295 539 40.0 % 51 3.9 % Legal and professional 12,944 7,379 6,996 5,565 75.4 % 383 5.5 % Marketing and donations 3,418 3,005 2,999 413 13.7 % 6 0.2 % ATM / debit card expense 6,384 5,322 4,300 1,062 20.0 % 1,022 23.8 % Other expense 18,381 22,452 15,995 (4,071 ) -18.1 % 6,457 40.4 % Total other expense $ 214,983 $ 185,740 $ 162,861 $ 29,243 15.7 % $ 22,879 14.0 % Total non-interest expense increased to $215.0 million in 2024 from $185.7 million in 2023 and $162.9 million in 2022. The primary reasons for the more significant year-to-year changes in other expense components are as follows: Salaries and employee benefits, the largest component of other expense, increased in 2024 was due to former Blackhawk Bank employees being present the entire calendar year, increase in the bonus accrual, incentive compensation, share based compensation, merit increases and applicable payroll taxes The increase in 2023 was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank, an increase in incentive compensation and commission, increases for merit raises and applicable payroll taxes, and an increase in employee group insurance expense, partially offset by a decline in bonus accrual expense. There were 1,198 full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2024, compared to 1,187 at December 31, 2023, and 1,043 at December 31, 2022. Occupancy and equipment expense increased primarily due to additional properties added in the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank being present the entire calendar year. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to increases in depreciation, equipment and other property related expenses from the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. Net other real estate owned expense decreased in 2024 primarily due to the large expenses occurring in 2023. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to properties sold or written down during the period. FDIC insurance expense increased in 2024 due to the Blackhawk Bank assets being present the entire calendar year. The increase in FDIC insurance expense in 2023 was due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank and an increase in the assessment rate. Amortization of other intangibles increased during 2024 primarily due to additional core deposit intangibles added from the acquisitions of Blackhawk Bank being present the entire calendar year. The increase in 2023 was due to the additional core deposit intangibles added with the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. Legal and professional expense primarily increased due to nonrecurring expenses associated with technology investment upgrades. The increase in 2023 was due to normal inflationary increases. ATM and debit card expenses increased during 2024 primarily due to an increase in electronic transactions following the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank being present the entire calendar year. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in electronic transactions following the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. Other operating expenses decreased in 2024 primarily due to the majority of acquisition costs associated with Blackhawk Bank occurring in 2023. The increase during 2023 was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank and nonrecurring costs associated with the closing and integration. Income Taxes Income tax expense amounted to $25.5 million in 2024 compared to $19.5 million in 2023, and $18.3 million in 2022. Effective tax rates were 24.5% for 2024, 22.0% for 2023, and 20.1% for 2022. The Company files U.S. federal and state of Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Wisconsin income tax returns. 23 Analysis of Consolidated Balance Sheets Securities The Company overall investment objectives are to insulate the investment portfolio from undue credit risk, maintain adequate liquidity, insulate capital against changes in market value and control excessive changes in earnings while optimizing investment performance. The types and maturities of securities purchased are primarily based on the Company current and projected liquidity and interest rate sensitivity positions. The following table sets forth the amortized cost of the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities for the last three years (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2024 2023 2022 Weighted Weighted Weighted Amortized Average Amortized Average Amortized Average Cost Yield Cost Yield Cost Yield U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government corporations and agencies $ 212,513 1.28 % $ 237,875 1.28 % $ 252,934 1.28 % Obligations of states and political subdivisions 324,046 2.28 % 337,835 2.31 % 347,409 2.31 % Mortgage-backed securities: GSE residential 653,760 1.88 % 714,216 1.91 % 744,636 1.69 % Other securities 69,396 4.27 % 76,081 3.65 % 90,347 3.41 % Total securities $ 1,259,715 2.01 % $ 1,366,007 2.00 % $ 1,435,326 1.87 % At December 31, 2024, the amortized cost of the Company investment portfolio decreased by $106.3 million from December 31, 2023 primarily due to sales of securities partially offset by purchases designed to raise the rate of return of the portfolio, calls, maturities and paydowns. The decrease in 2023 was primarily due to the amortization of the portfolio and securities sold after the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its overall liquidity and interest rate risk profile, as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to the risks assumed. The table below presents the credit ratings as of December 31, 2024 for certain investment securities (in thousands): Average Credit Rating of Fair Value at December 31, 2024 (1) Amortized Estimated Not Cost Fair Value AAA AA +/- A +/- BBB +/- < BBB - Rated Available-for-sale: U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government corporations and agencies $ 212,513 $ 191,358 $ 26,558 $ 162,668 $ $ $ $ 2,132 Obligations of state and political subdivisions 324,046 267,740 35,569 188,105 42,445 1,621 Mortgage-backed securities (2) 653,760 539,742 539,742 Other securities 67,117 64,452 7,919 16,440 6,807 33,286 Total available-for-sale $ 1,257,436 $ 1,063,292 $ 62,127 $ 358,692 $ 58,885 $ 6,807 $ $ 576,781 Held-to-maturity: Other securities $ 2,279 $ 2,279 $ $ $ $ $ $ 2,279 Equity securities: Federal Agricultural Mtg Corp 85 505 505 Midwest Independent BankersBank 150 215 215 Equalized Community Development Fund 3,719 3,719 3,719 Total Equity $ 3,954 $ 4,439 $ $ $ $ $ $ 4,439 (1) Credit ratings reflect the lowest current rating assigned by a nationally recognized credit rating agency.

While MBS and CMOs are no longer explicitly rated by credit rating agencies, the industry recognizes that they are backed by agencies which have an implied government guarantee. 24 Loans The loan portfolio (net of unearned interest) is the largest category of the Company earning assets. The following table summarizes the composition of the loan portfolio, including loans held for sale, for the last five years (dollars in thousands): Outstanding 2024 Loans 2023 2022 2021 2020 Construction and land development $ 236,093 4.2 % $ 205,077 $ 144,264 $ 145,118 $ 122,479 Agricultural real estate 390,760 6.9 % 391,132 410,327 279,272 254,341 1-4 family residential properties 496,597 8.8 % 542,469 440,180 400,313 325,762 Multifamily residential properties 332,644 5.9 % 319,129 294,346 298,942 189,632 Commercial real estate 2,417,585 42.6 % 2,384,704 2,030,011 1,666,198 1,174,300 Loans secured by real estate 3,873,679 68.4 % 3,842,511 3,319,128 2,789,843 2,066,514 Agricultural loans 239,671 4.2 % 196,272 166,838 151,484 137,352 Commercial and industrial loans 1,335,920 23.6 % 1,266,159 1,082,960 832,008 738,313 Consumer loans 53,960 1.0 % 91,014 97,775 78,442 78,002 All other loans 169,232 2.8 % 184,609 159,511 143,746 118,238 Total loans $ 5,672,462 100.0 % $ 5,580,565 $ 4,826,212 $ 3,995,523 $ 3,138,419 Loan balances increased by $91.9 million or 1.6% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. Loan balances increased by $754.4 million or 15.6% from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 of which approximately $730.2 million of gross loans acquired, after purchase accounting adjustments, from Blackhawk Bank. The balances of loans sold into the secondary market were $125.3 million in 2024 compared to $62.2 million in 2023. The balance of real estate loans held for sale, included in the balances shown above, amounted to $6.6 million and $5.0 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Commercial and commercial real estate loans generally involve higher credit risks than residential real estate and consumer loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate or equipment are often dependent upon the successful operation and management of the underlying assets, repayment of such loans may be influenced to a great extent by conditions in the market or the economy. The Company does not have any sub-prime mortgages or credit card loans outstanding which are also generally considered to be higher credit risk. First Mid Bank does not have a concentration, as defined by the regulatory agencies, in construction and land development loans or commercial real estate loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital for the periods shown above. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, First Mid Bank did have industry loan concentrations in excess of 25% of total risk-based capital in the following industries (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Principal % Outstanding Principal % Outstanding balance Loans balance Loans Other grain farming $ 507,555 8.95 % $ 472,456 8.47 % Lessors of non-residential buildings 1,049,372 18.50 % 1,086,152 19.46 % Lessors of residential buildings and dwellings 557,285 9.82 % 541,858 9.71 % Hotels and motels % 215,386 3.86 % The Company had no further industry loan concentrations in excess of 25% of total risk-based capital.

(2) Includes demand loans, past due loans and overdrafts. As of December 31, 2024, loans with maturities over one year consisted of approximately $2.7 billion in fixed rate loans and approximately $1.9 billion in variable rate loans. The loan maturities noted above are based on the contractual provisions of the individual loans. The Company has no general policy regarding renewals and borrower requests, which are handled on a case-by-case basis. 25 Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming Other Assets Nonperforming loans include: (a) loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis; (b) accruing loans contractually past due ninety days or more as to interest or principal payments; and (c) loans not included in (a) and (b) above which are defined as modified . Repossessed assets include primarily repossessed real estate and automobiles. The Company policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest income on any loan for which principal or interest is ninety days past due. The accrual of interest is discontinued earlier when, in the opinion of management, there is reasonable doubt as to the timely collection of interest or principal. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged against current year income. Subsequent receipts on non-accrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when, in the opinion of management, the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the timely collection of interest or principal. Restructured loans are loans on which, due to deterioration in the borrower financial condition, the original terms have been modified in favor of the borrower or either principal or interest has been forgiven. Repossessed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. These assets are recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure or repossession. Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for credit losses. On an ongoing basis, properties are appraised as required by market indications and applicable regulations. Write-downs for subsequent declines in value are recorded in non-interest expense in other real estate owned along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties. The following table presents information concerning the aggregate amount of nonperforming loans and repossessed assets (in thousands): December 31, 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Nonaccrual loans $ 28,775 $ 18,832 $ 15,956 $ 18,105 $ 23,750 Modified loans which are performing in accordance with revised terms 1,060 1,296 3,214 3,931 4,373 Total nonperforming loans 29,835 20,128 19,170 22,036 28,123 Repossessed assets 2,195 1,164 4,369 5,019 2,493 Total nonperforming loans and repossessed assets $ 32,030 $ 21,292 $ 23,539 $ 27,055 $ 30,616 Nonperforming loans to loans, before allowance for credit losses 0.53 % 0.36 % 0.40 % 0.55 % 0.90 % Nonperforming loans and repossessed assets to loans, before allowance for credit losses 0.56 % 0.38 % 0.49 % 0.68 % 0.98 % The $9.9 million increase in nonaccrual loans during 2024 resulted from the net of $18.8 million of loans put on nonaccrual status, offset by $4.7 million of loans transferred to other real estate owned, $3.3 million of loans charged off and $0.8 million of loans becoming current or paid-off.

The $1.6 million increase in repossessed assets during 2024 resulted from the net of $5.3 million of additional assets repossessed, $3.7 million of repossessed assets sold, $47,000 of writedowns on existing assets, and no deferred fair value marks were recognized.

The Company also recognized no deferred gains, recorded $47,000 of write downs on one real estate properties owned, and recorded no change in fair market value discount. Loan Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses represents management estimate of the reserve necessary to adequately account for probable losses existing in the current portfolio. The provision for credit losses is the charge against current earnings that is determined by management as the amount needed to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, and therefore the provision to be charged to current earnings, management relies predominantly on a disciplined credit review and approval process that extends to the full range of the Company credit exposure. The review process is directed by overall lending policy and is intended to identify, at the earliest possible stage, borrowers who might be facing financial difficulty. Once identified, the magnitude of exposure to individual borrowers is quantified in the form of specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses. Management considers collateral values and guarantees in the determination of such specific allocations. Additional factors considered by management in evaluating the overall adequacy of the allowance include historical net credit losses, the level and composition of nonaccrual, past due and renegotiated loans, trends in volumes and terms of loans, effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards or lending practices, lending staff changes, concentrations of credit, industry conditions and the current economic conditions in the region where the Company operates. Management reviews economic factors including the potential for reduced cash flow for commercial operating loans from reduction in sales or increased operating costs, decreased occupancy rates for commercial buildings, reduced levels of home sales for commercial land developments, the uncertainty regarding grain prices, increased operating costs for farmers, and increased levels of unemployment and bankruptcy impacting consumers ability to pay. Each of these economic uncertainties was taken into consideration in developing the level of the reserve. Management considers the allowance for credit losses a critical accounting policy. Management recognizes there are risk factors that are inherent in the Company loan portfolio. All financial institutions face risk factors in their loan portfolios because risk exposure is a function of the business. The Company operations (and therefore its loans) are concentrated in east central Illinois, an area where agriculture is the dominant industry. Accordingly, lending and other business relationships with agriculture-based businesses are critical to the Company success. At December 31, 2024, the Company loan portfolio included $630.6 million of loans to borrowers whose businesses are directly related to agriculture. Of this amount, $507.6 million was concentrated in other grain farming. Total loans to borrowers whose businesses are directly related to agriculture increased $42.1 million from $588.5 million at December 31, 2023 while loans concentrated in other grain farming increased $35.1 million from $472.5 million at December 31, 2023. While the Company adheres to sound underwriting practices, including collateralization of loans, any extended period of low commodity prices, drought conditions, significantly reduced yields on crops and/or reduced levels of government assistance to the agricultural industry could result in an increase in the level of problem agriculture loans and potentially result in credit losses within the agricultural portfolio. The Company also has $1.0 billion of loans to lessors of non-residential buildings and $557.3 million of loans to lessors of residential buildings and dwellings. The structure of the Company loan approval process is based on progressively larger lending authorities granted to individual loan officers, loan committees, and ultimately the Board of Directors. Outstanding balances to one borrower or affiliated borrowers are limited by federal regulation; however, limits well below the regulatory thresholds are generally observed. Most of the Company loans are to businesses located in the geographic market areas served by the Company branch bank system. Additionally, a significant portion of the collateral securing the loans in the portfolio is located within the Company primary geographic footprint. In general, the Company adheres to loan underwriting standards consistent with industry guidelines for all loan segments. 27 The Company minimizes credit risk by adhering to sound underwriting and credit review policies. Management and the Board of Directors of the Company review these policies at least annually. Senior management is actively involved in business development efforts and the maintenance and monitoring of credit underwriting and approval. The loan review system and controls are designed to identify, monitor, and address asset quality problems in an accurate and timely manner. On a quarterly basis, the Board of Directors and management review the status of problem loans and determine a best estimate of the allowance. In addition to internal policies and controls, regulatory authorities periodically review asset quality and the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Analysis of the allowance for credit losses for the past five years and of changes in the allowance for these periods is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Average loans outstanding, net of unearned income $ 5,558,527 $ 5,079,949 $ 4,518,566 $ 3,778,142 $ 3,003,488 Adjustment for adoption of ASU 2016-13 1,672 Allowance-beginning of period 68,675 59,093 54,655 41,910 28,583 Initial allowance on loans purchased with credit deterioration 3,791 863 2,074 Charge-offs: Construction and land development 14 2 205 13 1-4 family residential properties 195 87 191 371 393 Commercial real estate 451 25 414 535 830 Agricultural loans 2,410 408 93 Commercial and industrial loans 688 529 870 3,118 1,991 Consumer loans 2,004 1,568 1,380 1,405 617 Total charge-offs 5,748 2,631 2,950 5,634 3,844 Recoveries: Construction and land development 5 100 1-4 family residential properties 339 216 359 211 299 Commercial real estate 184 805 385 60 169 Agricultural loans 75 38 54 1 Commercial and industrial loans 330 576 208 139 179 Consumer loans 687 683 613 743 421 Total recoveries 1,620 2,318 1,719 1,154 1,068 Net charge-offs 4,128 313 1,231 4,480 2,776 Provision for credit losses 5,635 6,104 4,806 15,151 16,103 Allowance-end of period $ 70,182 $ 68,675 $ 59,093 $ 54,655 $ 41,910 Ratio of annualized net charge-offs to average loans 0.07 % 0.01 % 0.03 % 0.12 % 0.09 % Ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans outstanding (less unearned interest at end of period) 1.24 % 1.23 % 1.22 % 1.37 % 1.34 % Ratio of allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans 235.2 % 341.2 % 308.3 % 248.0 % 149.0 % The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 235.2% as of December 31, 2024 compared to 341.2% as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in this ratio is primarily due to a increase in nonperforming loans. Management believes that the overall estimate of the allowance for credit losses appropriately accounts for probable losses attributable to current exposures. During 2024, the Company had net charge-offs of $4.1 million compared to $313,000 in 2023. During 2024, there were significant charge-offs of two commercial real estate loans to 2 borrowers of $451,000, one agricultural operating loan to one borrower of $2.1 million, and a significant charge-off of one commercial operating loan to one borrower of $466,000. During 2023, there were significant charge-offs of one agricultural operating loan to one borrower of $181,000 and a significant charge-off of one commercial operating loan to one borrower of $353,000. At December 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses amounted to $70.2 million or 1.24% of total loans. At December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses amounted to $68.7 million or 1.23% of total loans. The allowance is allocated to the individual loan categories by a specific allocation for all classified loans plus a percentage of loans not classified based on historical losses and other factors. 28 The allowance for credit losses, in management's judgment, was allocated as follows to cover probable credit losses (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 % of loans to % of loans to % of loans to Allowance for credit losses total loans Allowance for credit losses total loans Allowance for credit losses total loans Construction and land development $ 3,275 4.2 % $ 2,918 3.7 % $ 2,250 3.0 % Agriculture real estate 1,361 6.9 % 1,366 7.0 % 1,433 8.5 % 1-4 family residential 3,579 8.8 % 4,220 9.7 % 3,742 9.1 % Commercial real estate 32,669 48.5 % 31,758 48.5 % 28,157 48.2 % Agricultural loans 1,957 4.2 % 705 3.5 % 585 3.5 % Commercial and industrial 25,602 26.5 % 25,450 26.0 % 20,808 25.7 % Consumer 1,739 0.9 % 2,258 1.6 % 2,118 2.0 % Allowance at end of year $ 70,182 100.0 % $ 68,675 100.0 % $ 59,093 100.0 % December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 % of loans to % of loans to Allowance for credit losses total loans Allowance for credit losses total loans Construction and land development $ 1,743 3.6 % $ 1,666 3.9 % Agriculture real estate 1,257 7.0 % 1,084 8.1 % 1-4 family residential 2,330 10.0 % 2,322 10.4 % Commercial real estate 26,246 49.2 % 19,660 43.4 % Agricultural loans 983 3.8 % 1,526 4.4 % Commercial and industrial 19,241 24.4 % 13,485 27.3 % Consumer 2,855 2.0 % 2,167 2.5 % Allowance at end of year $ 54,655 100.0 % $ 41,910 100.0 % Deposits Funding of the Company earning assets is substantially provided by a combination of consumer, commercial and public fund deposits. The Company continues to focus its strategies and emphasis on retail core deposits, the major component of funding sources. The following table sets forth the average deposits and weighted average rates for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 (dollars in thousands): 2024 2023 2022 Average Balance Weighted Average Rate Average Balance Weighted Average Rate Average Balance Weighted Average Rate Demand deposits: Non-interest-bearing $ 1,407,537 % $ 1,312,023 % $ 1,356,912 % Interest-bearing 3,040,397 2.24 % 2,618,452 1.83 % 2,598,480 0.53 % Savings 675,622 0.12 % 663,760 0.11 % 666,334 0.09 % Time deposits 1,019,629 3.74 % 961,162 2.98 % 655,240 0.69 % Total average deposits $ 6,143,185 1.74 % $ 5,555,397 1.40 % $ 5,276,966 0.36 % The following table sets forth the high and low month-end balances for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 (in thousands): 2024 2023 2022 High month-end balances of total deposits $ 6,242,937 $ 6,346,324 $ 5,487,305 Low month-end balances of total deposits 6,057,095 5,030,778 4,904,973 In 2024, the average balance of deposits increased by $587.8 million from 2023. The increase in 2024 was primarily due to deposits added in the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank being present the entire calendar year. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank, partially offset by higher rates driving outflows. 29 Balances of time deposits of $100,000 or more include time deposits maintained for public fund entities and consumer time deposits. The following table sets forth the maturity of time deposits of $100,000 or more (in thousands): December 31, 2024 2023 2022 3 months or less $ 237,309 $ 183,619 $ 80,856 Over 3 through 6 months 206,586 231,187 31,771 Over 6 through 12 months 121,154 170,641 127,405 Over 12 months 72,818 117,657 183,597 Total $ 637,867 $ 703,104 $ 423,629 The balance of time deposits of $100,000 or more decreased $65.2 million from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to intentional efforts to lower funding costs by reducing non-relationship time deposits. The balance of time deposits of $100,000 or more increased $279.5 million from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to time deposits acquired from Blackhawk Bank. In 2024 the Company maintained account relationships with various public entities throughout its market areas. These public entities had total balances of $261.2 million and $381.3 million in various checking accounts and time deposits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These balances are subject to change depending upon the cash flow needs of the public entity. Repurchase Agreements and Other Borrowings Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are short-term obligations of First Mid Bank. These obligations are collateralized with certain government securities that are direct obligations of the United States or one of its agencies. These retail repurchase agreements are a cash management service to its corporate customers. Other borrowings consist of Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) advances, federal funds purchased, loans (short-term or long-term debt) that the Company has outstanding, subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures. 30 Information relating to securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings as December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 is presented below (dollars in thousands): 2024 2023 2022 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 204,122 $ 213,721 $ 221,414 Federal Home Loan Bank advances: FHLB-overnight 90,000 65,000 Fixed term due in one year or less 7,435 60,000 110,040 Fixed term due after one year 145,085 203,787 290,031 Subordinated debt 87,472 106,755 94,553 Junior subordinated debentures 24,280 24,058 19,364 Total $ 558,394 $ 608,321 $ 800,402 Average interest rate at end of period 3.30 % 4.41 % 2.52 % Maximum outstanding at any month-end: Securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 282,285 $ 231,650 $ 257,061 Federal funds purchased 10,000 Federal Home Loan Bank advances: FHLB-overnight 90,000 150,000 310,000 Fixed term due in one year or less 65,000 105,024 160,048 Fixed term due after one year 223,744 415,005 290,031 Subordinated debt 106,934 106,755 94,553 Junior subordinated debentures 24,280 24,058 19,364 Averages for the period (YTD): Securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 221,789 $ 225,307 $ 202,242 Federal funds purchased 192 481 Federal Home Loan Bank advances: FHLB-overnight 560 55,104 100,084 Fixed term due in one year or less 45,587 95,669 94,247 Fixed term due after one year 193,802 311,424 82,070 Subordinated debt 99,313 99,638 94,471 Junior subordinated debentures 24,168 21,337 19,275 Debt: Loans due in one year or less 14 Total $ 585,219 $ 808,671 $ 592,884 Average interest rate during the period 3.71 % 2.16 % 2.16 % Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $9.6 million during 2024 primarily due to the seasonal demands in balances and change in cash flow needs of various customers. FHLB advances represent borrowings by the First Mid Bank to economically fund loan demand. At December 31, 2024, FHLB advances totaled $242.4 million with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.97% and maturities from March 2025 to December 2029. At December 31, 2023, FHLB advances totaled $263.6 million with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.58% and maturities from May 2024 to December 2029. The Company is party to a revolving credit agreement with The Northern Trust Company in the amount of $15 million. The balance on this line of credit was $0 as of December 31, 2024. This loan was renewed on April 5, 2024 for one year as a revolving credit agreement with a maximum available balance of $15 million. The interest rate is floating at 2.25% over the federal funds rate. The Company and its subsidiary banks were in compliance with the existing covenants at December 31, 2024 and 2023. On October 6, 2020, the Company issued and sold $96.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.95% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2030 (the Notes ). The Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of October 6, 2020 (the Base Indenture ), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the Trustee ), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 6, 2020 (the Supplemental Indenture ), between the Company and the Trustee. The Base Indenture, as amended and supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, governs the terms of the Notes and provides that the Notes are unsecured, subordinated debt obligations of the Company and will mature on October 15, 2030. From and including the date of issuance to, but excluding October 15, 2025, the Notes will bear interest at an initial rate of 3.95% per annum. From and including October 15, 2025 to, but excluding the maturity date or earlier redemption, the Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month Term SOFR plus a spread of 383 basis points, or such other rate as determined pursuant to the Supplemental Indenture, provided that in no event shall the applicable floating interest rate be less than zero per annum. On June 7, 2024, August 27, 2024, and September 6, 2024, the Company repurchased in open market transactions and subsequently cancelled $4.0 million, $15.0 million, and $1.0 million respectively, of the outstanding Notes. As a result, as of December 31, 2024, $76 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes remain issued and outstanding. The Company may, beginning with the interest payment date of October 15, 2025, and on any interest payment date thereafter, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. The Company may also redeem the Notes at any time, including prior to October 15, 2025, at the Company option, in whole but not in part, if: (i) a change or prospective 31 change in law occurs that could prevent the Company from deducting interest payable on the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (ii) a subsequent event occurs that could preclude the Notes from being recognized as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes; or (iii) the Company is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; in each case, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the redemption date. On August 15, 2023, the Company assumed, as part of the Blackhawk Bancorp, Inc. acquisition, $7.5 million principal amount of 3.5% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2031 ( Blackhawk Subordinated Debt I ). Blackhawk Subordinated Debt I was issued pursuant to Indenture between the Company and UMB Bank, as trustee. This Indenture governs the terms of the Blackhawk Subordinated Debt I and provides that such notes are unsecured, subordinated debt obligations of the Company and will mature on May 14, 2031. From and including the date of issuance to, but excluding May 14, 2026, the notes will bear interest at an initial rate of 3.5% per annum. From and including May 14, 2026 to, but excluding the maturity date, the notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month Term SOFR plus a spread of 285 basis points. On August 15, 2023, the Company assumed, as part of the Blackhawk Bancorp, Inc. acquisition, $7.5 million principal amount of 3.875% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2036 ( Blackhawk Subordinated Debt II ). Blackhawk Subordinated Debt II was issued pursuant to Indenture between the Company and UMB Bank, as trustee. This Indenture governs the terms of the Blackhawk Subordinated Debt II and provides that such notes are unsecured, subordinated debt obligations of the Company and will mature on May 14, 2036. From and including the date of issuance to, but excluding May 14, 2031, the notes will bear interest at an initial rate of 3.875% per annum. From and including May 14, 2031 to, but excluding the maturity date, the notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month Term SOFR plus a spread of 255 basis points. On April 26, 2006, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $10 million of fixed/floating rate trust preferred securities through First Mid-Illinois Statutory Trust II ( Trust II ), a statutory business trust and wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of the Company, as part of a pooled offering. The Company established Trust II for the purpose of issuing the trust preferred securities. The $10.0 million in proceeds from the trust preferred issuance and an additional $310,000 for the Company investment in common equity of Trust II, a total of $10.3 million, was invested in junior subordinated debentures of the Company. The underlying junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company to Trust II mature in 2036, bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.98% paid quarterly until June 15, 2011 and then converted to floating rate (LIBOR plus 160 basis points) after June 15, 2011 (6.81% and 7.25% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively). The net proceeds to the Company were used for general corporate purposes, including the Company acquisition of Mansfield Bancorp, Inc. in 2006. On September 8, 2016, the Company assumed the trust preferred securities of Clover Leaf Statutory Trust I ( CLST I ), a statutory business trust that was a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of First Clover Financial. The $4.0 million of trust preferred securities and an additional $124,000 additional investment in common equity of CLST I, is invested in junior subordinated debentures issued to CLST I. The subordinated debentures mature in 2025, bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 185 basis points (7.06% and 7.50% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively) and resets quarterly. On May 1, 2018, the Company assumed the trust preferred securities of FBTC Statutory Trust I ( FBTCST I ), a statutory business trust that was a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of First BancTrust Corporation. The $6.0 million of trust preferred securities and an additional $186,000 additional investment in common equity of FBTCST I is invested in junior subordinated debentures issued to FBTCST I. The subordinated debentures mature in 2035, bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 170 basis points (6.91% and 7.35% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively) and resets quarterly. On August 15, 2023, the Company assumed the trust preferred securities of Blackhawk Statutory Trust I ( BHST I ), a statutory business trust that was a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of Blackhawk Bancorp, Inc. The $1.0 million of trust preferred securities and an additional $31,000 investment in common equity of BHST I is invested in junior subordinated debentures issued to BHST I. The subordinated debentures mature in 2032, bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 325 basis points (8.17% and 8.87% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively) and resets quarterly. On August 15, 2023, the Company assumed the trust preferred securities of Blackhawk Statutory Trust II ( BHST II ), a statutory business trust that was a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of Blackhawk Bancorp, Inc. The $4.0 million of trust preferred securities and an additional $124,000 investment in common equity of BHST II is invested in junior subordinated debentures issued to BHST II. The subordinated debentures mature in 2035, bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 205 basis points (7.25% and 7.69% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively) and resets quarterly. The trust preferred securities issued by Trust II, CLST I, FBTCST I, BHST I, and BHST II are included as Tier 1 capital of the Company for regulatory capital purposes. On March 1, 2005, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule that allows the continued limited inclusion of trust preferred securities in the calculation of Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes. The final rule provided a five-year transition period, ending September 30, 2010, for application of the revised quantitative limits. On March 17, 2009, the Federal Reserve Board adopted an additional final rule that delayed the effective date of the new limits on inclusion of trust preferred securities in the calculation of Tier 1 capital until March 31, 2012. The application of the revised quantitative limits did not and is not expected to have a significant impact on its calculation of Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes or its classification as well-capitalized. The Dodd-Frank Act, signed into law July 21, 2010, removes trust preferred securities as a permitted component of a holding company Tier 1 capital after a three-year phase-in period beginning January 1, 2013 for larger holding companies. For holding companies with less than $15 billion in consolidated assets, existing issues of trust preferred securities are grandfathered and not subject to this new restriction. New issuances of trust preferred securities, however, would not count as Tier 1 regulatory capital. 32 In addition to requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act discussed above, the act also required the federal banking agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds). This rule is generally referred to as the Volcker Rule. On December 10, 2013, the federal banking agencies issued final rules to implement the prohibitions required by the Volcker Rule. Following the publication of the final rule, and in reaction to concerns in the banking industry regarding the adverse impact the final rule treatment of certain collateralized debt instruments has on community banks, the federal banking agencies approved a final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities. Under the final rule, the agencies permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered funds by banking entities under $15 billion in assets if (1) the collateralized debt obligation was established and issued prior to May 19, 2010, (2) the banking entity reasonably believes that the offering proceeds received by the collateralized debt obligation were invested primarily in qualifying trust preferred collateral, and (3) the banking entity interests in the collateralized debt obligation was acquired on or prior to December 10, 2013. Although the Volcker Rule impacts many large banking entities, the Company does not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will have a material effect on the operations of the Company or First Mid Bank. Interest Rate Sensitivity The Company seeks to maximize its net interest margin while maintaining an acceptable level of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk can be defined as the amount of forecasted net interest income that may be gained or lost due to changes in the interest rate environment, a variable over which management has no control. Interest rate risk, or sensitivity, arises when the maturity or repricing characteristics of interest-bearing assets differ significantly from the maturity or repricing characteristics of interest-bearing liabilities. The Company monitors its interest rate sensitivity position to maintain a balance between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities. This balance serves to limit the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. The Company asset liability management committee (ALCO) oversees the interest rate sensitivity position and directs the overall allocation of funds. In the banking industry, a traditional way to measure potential net interest income exposure to changes in interest rates is through a technique known as static GAP analysis which measures the cumulative differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities maturing or repricing at various intervals. The Company has also assumed prepayments of loan assets in amounts consistent with market expectations. By comparing the volumes of interest-bearing assets and liabilities that have contractual maturities, repricing points, and prepayments at various times in the future, management can gain insight into the amount of interest rate risk embedded in the balance sheet. The following table sets forth the Company interest rate repricing GAP for selected maturity periods at December 31, 2024 (dollars in thousands): Rate Sensitive Within 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years Thereafter Total Fair Value Interest-earning assets: Federal funds sold and other interest-bearing deposits $ 29,104 $ $ $ $ 29,104 $ 29,104 Certificates of deposit investments 2,660 840 3,500 3,500 Taxable investment securities 128,018 173,533 259,390 444,170 1,005,111 1,005,111 Nontaxable investment securities 4,239 12,767 10,597 37,296 64,899 64,899 Loans 2,657,979 2,017,211 662,031 335,241 5,672,462 5,314,756 Total $ 2,822,000 $ 2,204,351 $ 932,018 $ 816,707 $ 6,775,076 $ 6,417,370 Interest-bearing liabilities: Savings and NOW accounts $ 174,789 $ $ $ 2,369,372 $ 2,544,161 $ 2,544,161 Money market accounts 1,196,537 1,196,537 1,196,537 Other time deposits 872,773 94,538 19,333 599 987,243 987,243 Short-term borrowings/debt 294,122 294,122 294,122 Long-term borrowings/debt 56,715 157,662 45,000 4,895 264,272 257,598 Total $ 2,594,936 $ 252,200 $ 64,333 $ 2,374,866 $ 5,286,335 $ 5,279,661 Rate sensitive assets rate sensitive liabilities $ 227,064 $ 1,952,151 $ 867,685 $ (1,558,159 ) $ 1,488,741 Cumulative GAP $ 227,064 $ 2,179,214 $ 3,046,900 $ 1,488,741 Cumulative amounts as % of total rate sensitive assets 3.4 % 28.8 % 12.8 % (23.0 )% Cumulative ratio 3.4 % 32.2 % 45.0 % 22.0 % The static GAP analysis shows that at December 31, 2024, the Company was liability sensitive, on a cumulative basis, through the twelve-month time horizon. This indicates that future increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest income. There are several ways the Company measures and manages the exposure to interest rate sensitivity, including static GAP analysis. The Company ALCO also uses other financial models to project interest income under various rate scenarios and prepayment/extension assumptions consistent with First Mid Bank historical experience and with known industry trends. ALCO meets at least monthly to review the Company exposure to interest rate changes as indicated by the various techniques and to make necessary changes in the composition terms and/or rates of the assets and liabilities. 33 Capital Resources At December 31, 2024, the Company stockholders' equity had increased approximately $53.2 million, or 6.7%, to $846.4 million from $793.2 million as of December 31, 2023.

As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on the Company performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or experience the same magnitude of changes as goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation. In the current economic environment, liquidity and interest rate adjustments are features of the Company assets and liabilities that are important to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels. The Company attempts to maintain a balance between monetary assets and monetary liabilities, over time, to offset these potential effects.
