ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the discussion in the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Business . This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors. Overview We are a fully integrated provider of data, video and voice services in 21 Western, Midwestern and Southern states. We provide these broadband services to residential and business customers in more than 950 communities. The markets we serve are primarily non-metropolitan, secondary and tertiary markets, with 78% of our customers located in seven states: Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. Our biggest customer concentrations are in the Mississippi Gulf Coast region and in the greater Boise, Idaho region. We provided service to approximately 907,000 residential and business customers out of approximately 2.3 million homes passed as of December 31, 2019. Of these customers, approximately 773,000 subscribed to data services, 314,000 subscribed to video services and 139,000 subscribed to voice services. We generate substantially all of our revenues through four primary products. Ranked by share of our total revenues during 2019, they are residential data (46.9%), residential video (28.7%), business services (data, voice and video 17.5%) and residential voice (3.7%). The profit margins, growth rates and capital intensity of our four primary products vary significantly due to competition, product maturity and relative costs. In 2019, our Adjusted EBITDA margins for residential data and business services were approximately seven and nine times greater, respectively, than for residential video, compared to six and seven times greater, respectively, in 2018. The increases were due primarily to acquisitions made during 2019 as well as a continued decrease in residential video Adjusted EBITDA margins. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin for a product line as Adjusted EBITDA attributable to that product line divided by revenue attributable to that product line (see Use of Adjusted EBITDA below for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure). This margin disparity is largely the result of significant programming costs and retransmission fees incurred to deliver residential video services, which in each of the last three years represented between 58% and 65% of total residential video revenues. None of our other product lines has direct costs representing as substantial a portion of revenues as programming costs and retransmission fees represent for residential video, and indirect costs are generally allocated on a per PSU basis. Beginning in 2013, we shifted our focus towards growing our higher margin businesses, namely residential data and business services, rather than our prior concentration on growing revenues through subscriber retention and maximizing customer PSUs. We adapted our strategy to face the industry-wide trends of declining profitability of residential video services and declining revenues from residential voice services. The declining profitability of residential video services is primarily due to increasing programming costs and retransmission fees and competition from other content providers, and the declining revenues from residential voice services are primarily due to the increasing use of wireless voice services instead of residential voice services. Separately, we have also focused on retaining customers who are likely to produce higher relative value over the life of their service relationships with us, are less attracted by discounting, require less support and churn less. This strategy focuses on increasing Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures and margins. Excluding the effects of our recent acquisitions, the trends described above have impacted our four primary product lines in the following ways: Residential data . We have experienced growth in residential data customers and revenue every year since 2013. We expect this growth to continue as our upgrades in broadband capacity, ability to offer higher access speeds than many of our competitors and Wi-Fi support service will enable us to capture additional market share from both data subscribers who use other providers as well as households in our footprint that do not yet subscribe to data services from any provider. 34 Table of Contents Residential video. Residential video service is an increasingly costly and fragmenting business, with programming costs and retransmission fees continuing to escalate in the face of a proliferation of streaming content alternatives. We intend to continue our strategy of focusing on the higher-margin businesses of residential data and business services while de-emphasizing our residential video business. As a result, we expect that residential video revenues from our existing customer base will decline further in the future. Residential voice. We have experienced declines in residential voice customers as a result of consumers in the United States deciding to terminate their residential voice services and exclusively use wireless voice services. We believe this trend will continue because of competition from wireless voice service providers. Revenues from residential voice customers have declined over recent years, and we expect this decline will continue. Business services . We have experienced significant growth in business data customers and revenues, and we expect this growth to continue. We attribute this growth to our strategic focus on increasing sales to business customers and our efforts to attract enterprise business customers. Margins for products sold to business customers have remained attractive, which we expect will continue. We continue to experience increased competition, particularly from telephone companies, cable and municipal overbuilders, OTT video providers and DBS television providers. Because of the levels of competition we face, we believe it is important to make investments in our infrastructure. In addition, a key objective of our capital allocation process is to invest in initiatives designed to drive revenue and Adjusted EBITDA expansion. Over the last three years, more than 50% of our total capital expenditures have been focused on infrastructure improvements that were intended to grow these measures. We continue to invest capital to, among other things, increase our plant and data capacities as well as network reliability. We offer Gigabit data service to over 97% of our homes passed, and we have begun deploying DOCSIS 3.1 to further increase our network capacity and enable future growth in our residential data and business services product lines. We expect to continue to devote financial resources to infrastructure improvements, including in certain of the new markets we have acquired, because we believe these investments are necessary to continually meet our customers' needs and to remain competitive. The capital enhancements associated with acquired operations include rebuilding low capacity markets; reclaiming bandwidth from analog video services; implementing 32-channel bonding; deploying DOCSIS 3.1; converting back office functions such as billing, accounting and service provisioning; migrating products to legacy Cable One platforms; and expanding our high-capacity fiber network. Our primary goals are to continue growing residential data and business services, to increase profit margins and to deliver strong Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures. To achieve these goals, we intend to continue our disciplined cost management approach, remain focused on customers with expected higher relative value and follow through with further planned investments in broadband plant upgrades, including the deployment of DOCSIS 3.1 capabilities and new data service offerings for residential and business customers. On May 1, 2017, we acquired NewWave, a provider of data, video and voice services to residential and business customers throughout non-urban areas of Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. We paid a purchase price of $740.2 million in cash on a debt-free basis. In connection with the transaction, we amended our existing credit agreement and incurred $750.0 million of senior secured loans which were used to finance the acquisition, repay in full our then-existing term loan and pay related fees and expenses. On January 8, 2019, we acquired Clearwave, a facilities-based service provider that owns and operates a high-capacity fiber network offering dense regional coverage in Southern Illinois. We paid a purchase price of $358.8 million in cash on a debt-free basis. The acquisition provides us with a premier fiber network within our existing footprint, further enables us to supply our customers with enhanced business services solutions and provides a platform to allow us to replicate Clearwave strategy in several of our other markets. The all-cash transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from new indebtedness. On October 1, 2019, we acquired the data, video and voice business and certain related assets of Fidelity, a provider of connectivity services to residential and business customers throughout Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. We paid a purchase price of $531.4 million in cash on a debt-free basis, after customary post-closing adjustments. Cable One and Fidelity share similar strategies, customer demographics and products. We believe the acquisition provides us opportunities for revenue growth and Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion as well as the potential to realize cost synergies. The all-cash transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from new indebtedness. 35 Table of Contents Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for 2018 compared to 2017 contained in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . Throughout this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , all totals, percentages and year-over-year changes are calculated using exact numbers. Minor differences may exist due to rounding. Results of Operations Adoption of New Lease Accounting Standard We adopted the new lease accounting standard, Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842 - Leases , effective January 1, 2019, using the Comparatives Under 840 Option approach to transition. The adoption resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for substantially all leases within the consolidated balance sheet. No prior period amounts were retroactively adjusted as a result of the adoption. Refer to notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. PSU and Customer Counts The following table provides an overview of selected subscriber data for the time periods specified (in thousands, except percentages): As of December 31, Annual Net Gain/(Loss) 2019 2018 Change % Change Residential data PSUs 695 601 94 15.7 Residential video PSUs (1) 298 310 (12 ) (3.9 ) Residential voice PSUs 105 99 6 5.7 Total residential PSUs 1,098 1,010 88 8.7 Business data PSUs (2) 78 62 16 25.8 Business video PSUs 16 16 (0 ) (1.5 ) Business voice PSUs (3) 35 27 8 28.8 Total business services PSUs 129 105 24 22.4 Total data PSUs 773 663 110 16.6 Total video PSUs 314 326 (12 ) (3.8 ) Total voice PSUs 139 126 13 10.7 Total PSUs 1,227 1,115 111 10.0 Residential customer relationships 822 734 88 12.0 Business customer relationships 85 71 14 20.2 Total customer relationships 907 805 102 12.7 (1) Residential video PSUs include all basic residential customers who receive video services and may have one or more digital set-top boxes or cable cards deployed. Residential bulk multi-dwelling accounts are included in our video PSUs at the individual unit level. (2) Business data PSUs include commercial accounts that receive data service via a modem and commercial accounts that receive data services via fiber optic connections. (3) Business voice customers who have multiple voice lines are only counted once in the PSU total. In recent years, our customer mix has shifted, causing subscribers to move from triple-play packages combining data, video and voice services to single and double-play packages. This is largely because some residential video customers have defected to DBS services and OTT offerings and households continue to discontinue residential voice service. In addition, we have focused on selling data-only packages to new customers rather than cross-selling video to these customers. 36 Table of Contents 2019 Compared to 2018 Revenues Revenues increased $95.7 million, or 8.9%, due primarily to increases in residential data and business services revenues of $54.4 million and $48.5 million, respectively. The increase was the result of organic growth in our higher margin product lines of residential data and business services, the acquired Fidelity and Clearwave operations, a residential video rate adjustment and the implementation of modem rental charges to certain business customers, partially offset by decreases in residential video and other revenues. Revenues by service offering were as follows for 2019 and 2018, together with the percentages of total revenues that each item represented for the years presented (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2019 vs. 2018 Revenues % of Total Revenues % of Total $ Change % Change Residential data $ 547,240 46.9 $ 492,816 46.0 $ 54,424 11.0 Residential video 335,190 28.7 343,384 32.0 (8,194 ) (2.4 ) Residential voice 43,521 3.7 41,278 3.8 2,243 5.4 Business services 204,500 17.5 155,952 14.5 48,548 31.1 Other 37,546 3.2 38,865 3.7 (1,319 ) (3.4 ) Total revenues $ 1,167,997 100.0 $ 1,072,295 100.0 $ 95,702 8.9 Average monthly revenue per unit ( ARPU ) for the indicated service offerings were as follows for 2019 and 2018: Year Ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018 2019 2018 $ Change % Change Residential data (1) $ 71.86 $ 68.70 $ 3.16 4.6 Residential video (1) $ 93.51 $ 86.97 $ 6.54 7.5 Residential voice (1) , (2) $ 36.86 $ 32.86 $ 4.00 12.2 Business services (2) , (3) $ 221.90 $ 189.53 $ 32.37 17.1 (1) ARPU values represent the applicable annual residential service revenues (excluding installation and activation fees) divided by the corresponding average of the number of PSUs at the beginning and end of each year, divided by 12, except that for any new PSUs added as a result of an acquisition occurring during the year, the associated ARPU values represent the applicable residential service revenues (excluding installation and activation fees) divided by the pro-rated average number of PSUs during such period. (2) The increases in residential voice and business services ARPU from the prior year were partially a result of certain passthrough fees that were historically reported on a net basis. Residential voice and business services ARPU for 2019 would have been $33.65 and $218.83, respectively, if reported on a comparable basis. (3) ARPU values represent annual business services revenues divided by the average of the number of business customer relationships at the beginning and end of each year, divided by 12, except that for any new business customer relationships added as a result of an acquisition occurring during the year, the associated ARPU values represent business services revenues divided by the pro-rated average number of business customer relationships during such period. Residential data service revenues increased $54.4 million, or 11.0%, as a result of organic subscriber growth, three months of Fidelity operations, a reduction in package discounting and increased customer subscriptions to premium tiers. Residential video service revenues decreased $8.2 million, or 2.4%, due primarily to a 12.4% year-over-year decrease in legacy Cable One and NewWave residential video subscribers, partially offset by three months of Fidelity operations and a rate adjustment beginning in February 2019. Residential voice service revenues increased $2.2 million, or 5.4%, due primarily to three months of Fidelity operations and the recognition of certain passthrough fees that were historically reported on a net basis, partially offset by an 11.1% year-over-year decrease in legacy Cable One and NewWave residential voice subscribers. Business services revenues increased $48.5 million, or 31.1%, due primarily to the acquired Clearwave and Fidelity operations, organic growth in our business data and voice services to small and medium-sized businesses and enterprise customers, and implementation of modem rental charges to certain business customers during the first quarter of 2019. Total business customer relationships increased 20.2% year-over-year. 37 Table of Contents Costs and Expenses Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) were $388.6 million for 2019 and increased $18.3 million, or 4.9%, compared to 2018. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 33.3% for 2019 compared to 34.5% for 2018. The increase in operating expenses attributable to Clearwave and Fidelity operations was $15.4 million. Excluding the expenses associated with Clearwave and Fidelity operations, operating expenses were $373.1 million for 2019, an increase of $2.9 million, or 0.8%, compared to 2018. The increase was due primarily to higher regulatory costs resulting from certain passthrough fees that were historically reported on a net basis, partially offset by lower programming expenses. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, excluding the impact of Clearwave and Fidelity operations, were 33.7% for 2019 compared to 34.5% for 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $22.9 million, or 10.3%, to $245.1 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 21.0% and 20.7% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to Clearwave and Fidelity operations was $9.8 million. Excluding the expenses associated with Clearwave and Fidelity operations, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $13.1 million, or 5.9%, to $235.3 million due primarily to acquisition-related and rebranding costs incurred during 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues, excluding the impact of Clearwave and Fidelity operations, were 21.2% for 2019 compared to 20.7% for 2018. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $19.0 million, or 9.6%, including a $21.0 million increase attributable to Clearwave and Fidelity operations. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expense was 18.6% for 2019 compared to 18.4% for 2018. We recognized a net loss on asset disposals of $7.2 million in 2019 compared to $14.2 million in 2018. In 2019, we recognized a gain on the sale of a non-operating property that housed our former headquarters, while the prior year included a write down of excess equipment and more asset disposals. Interest Expense Interest expense increased $11.3 million, or 18.7%, to $71.7 million, driven primarily by additional outstanding debt incurred in connection with the Clearwave and Fidelity acquisitions and interest rate swap settlements, partially offset by lower interest rates on variable rate term loans, including loans used to redeem $450.0 million of higher rate senior unsecured notes in the second quarter of 2019 (the Note Redemption ). Other Income (Expense) , Net We recognized other expense of $4.9 million during 2019, consisting primarily of a $6.5 million call premium related to the Note Redemption and $4.9 million of debt issuance cost write-offs and expenses associated with financing transactions (refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details), partially offset by interest and investment income. We recognized other income of $4.5 million during 2018, consisting primarily of interest and investment income. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision increased $8.0 million, or 17.0%, due primarily to an increase in taxable income of $21.8 million. Our effective tax rate was 23.6% and 22.3% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Use of Adjusted EBITDA We use certain measures that are not defined by GAAP to evaluate various aspects of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as superior to, or as a substitute for, net income reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to net income below. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income plus interest expense, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, severance expense, loss on deferred compensation, acquisition-related costs, loss on asset disposals, system conversion costs, rebranding costs, other (income) expense and other unusual expenses, as provided in the following table. As such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of our business as well as other non-cash or special items and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. This measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and our cash cost of debt financing. These costs are evaluated through other financial measures. 38 Table of Contents We use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our performance. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generally correlates to the measure used in the leverage ratio calculations under our senior credit facilities to determine compliance with the covenants contained in our credit agreement. Adjusted EBITDA is also a significant performance measure used by us in our annual incentive compensation program. Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account cash used for mandatory debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures, and thus does not represent residual funds available for discretionary uses. Year Ended December 31 , 2019 vs. 2018 (dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 $ Change % Change Net income $ 178,582 $ 164,760 $ 13,822 8.4 Plus: Interest expense 71,729 60,415 11,314 18.7 Income tax provision 55,233 47,224 8,009 17.0 Depreciation and amortization 216,687 197,731 18,956 9.6 Equity-based compensation 12,300 10,486 1,814 17.3 Severance expense 215 2,347 (2,132 ) (90.8 ) Loss on deferred compensation 400 425 (25 ) (5.9 ) Acquisition-related costs 9,590 1,773 7,817 NM Loss on asset disposals, net 7,187 14,167 (6,980 ) (49.3 ) System conversion costs 4,828 5,037 (209 ) (4.1 ) Rebranding costs 7,294 968 6,326 NM Other (income) expense, net 4,907 (4,487 ) 9,394 (209.4 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 568,952 $ 500,846 $ 68,106 13.6 NM = Not meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures with similar titles are common measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Financial Condition: Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Our primary funding requirements are for our ongoing operations, planned capital expenditures, potential business acquisitions and strategic investments, payments of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. We believe that existing cash balances, our senior credit facilities and operating cash flows will provide adequate support for these funding requirements over the next 12 months. However, our ability to fund operations, make planned capital expenditures, make future business acquisitions and strategic investments, pay quarterly dividends and make share repurchases depends on future operating performance and cash flows, which, in turn, are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. The following table shows a summary of our net cash flows for the years indicated (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31 , 2019 vs. 2018 2019 2018 $ Change % Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 491,741 $ 407,769 $ 83,972 20.6 Net cash used in investing activities (1,134,242 ) (214,295 ) (919,947 ) NM Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 503,659 (91,113 ) 594,772 NM Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (138,842 ) 102,361 (241,203 ) (235.6 ) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 264,113 161,752 102,361 63.3 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 125,271 $ 264,113 $ (138,842 ) (52.6 ) NM = Not meaningful. 39 Table of Contents The $84.0 million year-over-year increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $68.1 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities versus a decrease in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest as well as the Note Redemption call premium, acquisition-related costs and rebranding costs. The $919.9 million increase in net cash used in investing activities from the prior year was due primarily to the Clearwave and Fidelity acquisitions during 2019 and higher capital expenditures. The $594.8 million change in net cash provided by financing activities from the prior year was primarily a result of proceeds from the issuance of new debt incurred during 2019 and fewer share repurchases, partially offset by higher payments on long-term debt, including $450.0 million used for the Note Redemption and the refinancing of a $234.4 million term loan, and higher payments of debt issuance costs. On July 1, 2015, the Board authorized up to $250.0 million of share repurchases (subject to a total cap of 600,000 shares of our common stock). Purchases under the share repurchase program may be made from time to time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. The size and timing of these purchases are based on a number of factors, including share price and business and market conditions. Since the inception of the share repurchase program through the end of 2019, we have repurchased 210,631 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $104.9 million. During the first quarter of 2019, we repurchased 5,984 shares at an aggregate cost of $5.1 million. We currently expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of our common stock, subject to approval of the Board. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Board approved a quarterly dividend of $2.25 per share of common stock, which was paid on December 6, 2019. On February 4, 2020, the Board approved a quarterly dividend of $2.25 per share of common stock to be paid on March 6, 2020 to holders of record as of February 18, 2020. Financing Activity As of December 31, 2019, we had an aggregate of approximately $1.8 billion of outstanding term loan borrowings, $6.7 million of letter of credit issuances and $343.3 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ). The Revolving Credit Facility gives us the ability to issue letters of credit, which reduce the amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2019, letter of credit issuances under the Revolving Credit Facility were held for the benefit of certain general and liability insurance matters and other performance obligations under government grant programs and bore interest at a rate of 1.63% per annum. We are required to pay commitment fees on any unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate between 0.20% per annum and 0.30% per annum, determined on a quarterly basis by reference to a pricing grid based on our total net leverage ratio. A summary of our outstanding term loans as of December 31, 2019 is as follows (dollars in thousands): Instrument Draw Date (s) Original Principal Amortization Per Annum (1) Outstanding Principal Final Maturity Date Balance Due Upon Maturity Benchmark Rate Applicable Margin (2) Interest Rate Term Loan A-2 5/8/2019 (3) $ 700,000 Varies ( 4) $ 694,045 5/8/2024 $ 513,945 LIBOR 1.50% 3.30% 10/1/2019 (3) Term Loan B-1 5/1/2017 500,000 1.0% 487,500 5/1/2024 466,250 LIBOR 1.75% 3.55% Term Loan B-2 1/7/2019 250,000 1.0% 248,125 1/7/2026 233,125 LIBOR 2.00% 3.80% Term Loan B-3 6/14/2019 325,000 1.0% 323,375 1/7/2026 303,875 LIBOR 2.00% 3.80% Total $ 1,775,000 $ 1,753,045 $ 1,517,195 (1) Payable in equal quarterly installments (expressed as a percentage of the original principal amount). All loans may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium (subject to customary London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) breakage provisions). (2) The Term Loan A-2 interest rate spread can vary between 1.25% and 1.75%, determined on a quarterly basis by reference to a pricing grid based on our total net leverage ratio. All other applicable margins are fixed. (3) On May 8, 2019, $250.0 million was drawn. On October 1, 2019, an additional $450.0 million was drawn. (4) Per annum amortization rates for years one through five following the closing date are 2.5%, 2.5%, 5.0%, 7.5% and 12.5%, respectively. 40 Table of Contents In connection with various financing transactions completed during 2019, we incurred $11.8 million of debt issuance costs. We also wrote-off $4.2 million of existing unamortized debt issuance costs, including $3.8 million associated with the Note Redemption. We recorded debt issuance cost amortization of $4.6 million and $4.2 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts are reflected within interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Unamortized debt issuance costs totaled $20.6 million and $17.6 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of which $2.4 million and zero are reflected within other noncurrent assets, respectively, and $18.1 million and $17.6 million are reflected as reductions to long-term debt, respectively in the consolidated balance sheets. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2019. During the first quarter of 2019, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements in order to convert our interest payment obligations with respect to an aggregate of $1.2 billion of our variable rate LIBOR indebtedness to a fixed rate. Under the first swap agreement, with respect to a notional amount of $850.0 million, our monthly payment obligation is determined at a fixed base rate of 2.653%. Under the second swap agreement, which is a forward-starting swap with respect to a notional amount of $350.0 million, our monthly payment obligation beginning in June 2020 is determined at a fixed base rate of 2.739%. Both interest rate swap agreements are scheduled to mature in the first quarter of 2029 but may be terminated prior to their scheduled maturities at our election or that of the counterparty as provided in each swap agreement. We recognized a loss of $3.1 million on the interest rate swaps for 2019, which was reflected in interest expense within the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. Refer to notes 9 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our financing activity, outstanding debt and interest rate swaps. Capital Expenditures We have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements as well as capital enhancements associated with acquired operations, including rebuilding low capacity markets; reclaiming bandwidth from analog video services; implementing 32-channel bonding; deploying DOCSIS 3.1; converting back office functions such as billing, accounting and service provisioning; migrating products to legacy Cable One platforms; and expanding our high-capacity fiber network. Capital expenditures are funded primarily by cash on hand and cash flows from operating activities. The following table presents our capital expenditures by category for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31 , 2019 2018 Customer premise equipment $ 57,378 $ 56,500 Commercial 45,424 9,832 Scalable infrastructure 44,823 46,176 Line extensions 17,469 16,381 Upgrade/rebuild 37,144 30,081 Support capital 60,114 58,796 Total $ 262,352 $ 217,766 Contractual Obligations and Contingent Commitments The following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands): Year E nding December 31, Programming Purchase Commitments (1) Lease Payments (2) Debt Payments ( 3 ) Other Purchase Obligations ( 4 ) Total 2020 $ 187,427 $ 6,221 $ 28,321 $ 28,955 $ 250,924 2021 106,055 4,956 37,106 12,946 161,063 2022 18,688 3,878 54,677 4,253 81,496 2023 10,699 3,452 81,033 2,072 97,256 2024 8,074 2,027 1,009,158 828 1,020,087 Thereafter 3,398 11,566 542,750 4,625 562,339 Total $ 334,341 $ 32,100 $ 1,753,045 $ 53,679 $ 2,173,165 (1) Programming purchase commitments represent contracts that we have with cable television networks and broadcast stations to provide programming services to our subscribers. The amounts reported represent estimates of the future programming costs for these purchase commitments based on estimated subscriber numbers, tier placements as of December 31, 2019 and the per-subscriber rates contained in the contracts. Actual amounts due under such contracts may differ from the amounts above based on the actual subscriber numbers and tier placements at the time. Programming purchases pursuant to non-binding commitments are not reflected in the amounts shown. (2) Lease payments include payment obligations related to our outstanding finance and operating lease arrangements as of December 31, 2019. (3) Debt payments include principal repayment obligations for our outstanding debt instruments as of December 31, 2019. (4) Other purchase obligations include purchase obligations related to capital projects and other legally binding commitments. Other purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the amounts shown but are included within accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. 41 Table of Contents We incur the following costs as part of our operations, however, they are not included within the contractual obligations table above for the reasons discussed below: We rent space on utility poles in order to provide our services to certain subscribers. Generally, pole rentals are cancellable on short notice. However, we anticipate that such rentals will recur. Rent expense for pole attachments was $9.5 million and $8.9 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Fees imposed on us by various governmental authorities, including franchise fees, are passed through monthly to our customers and are periodically remitted to authorities. These fees were $22.7 million and $16.1 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. As we act as principal in these arrangements, these fees are reported in video and voice revenues on a gross basis with corresponding expenses included within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. We have franchise agreements requiring plant construction and the provision of services to customers within the franchise areas. In connection with these obligations under existing franchise agreements, we obtain surety bonds or letters of credit guaranteeing performance to municipalities and public utilities and payment of insurance premiums. Such surety bonds and letters of credit totaled $18.3 million and $13.3 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Payments under these arrangements are required only in the remote event of nonperformance. We do not expect that these contingent commitments will result in any amounts being paid. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or financing arrangements with special-purpose entities. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to our results of operations and financial condition and if it requires management most difficult, subjective and complex judgments in its application. For a summary of all our significant accounting policies, see note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Long-lived Assets A long-lived asset or asset group is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment may include: a significant decrease in the market value of the asset; 42 Table of Contents a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant change in the physical condition of the asset; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset; a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with an asset; and a current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. When an indicator of impairment is determined, the first step is to identify the future intent of the asset or asset group: hold for continued use, hold for sale or dispose by a means other than sale. If the asset is held for continued use and the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted sum of cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposition of the property, the impairment loss is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group, and the new cost basis is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset. If the intent is to hold the asset for sale and certain other criteria are met (e.g., the asset can be disposed of currently, appropriate levels of authority have approved the sale and there is an active program to locate a buyer), the impairment test involves comparing the asset carrying value to its estimated fair value less disposal costs. To the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset estimated fair value less disposal costs, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference. If the asset is to be disposed by a means other than sale, the depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life. Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether an event has occurred, determining the future cash flows for the assets involved and selecting the appropriate discount rate to be applied in determining estimated fair value. Goodw ill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We have a significant amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that are reviewed at least annually for impairment. These balances were as follows (dollars in thousands): As of December 31, 2019 2018 Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets $ 1,414,668 $ 984,500 Total assets $ 3,151,831 $ 2,303,234 Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as a percentage of total assets 44.9 % 42.7 % Goodwill . Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from anticipated synergies and intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition, including an assembled workforce, noncontractual relationships and other agreements. We assess the recoverability of our goodwill as of October 1st of each year, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. Beginning on October 1, 2019, we prospectively changed the annual goodwill impairment testing date from November 30th to October 1st. The voluntary change was to better align our goodwill impairment testing procedures with our annual planning and budgeting process. This change did not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment loss, nor did the change have a cumulative effect on pre-tax income, net income, retained earnings or net assets. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. To determine our reporting units, we evaluate the components one level below the segment level and we aggregate the components if they have similar economic characteristics. As a result of this assessment, our reporting units are established at the geographic division level. We evaluate the determination of our reporting units used to test for impairment periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. The quantitative assessment considers whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Any excess amount is recorded as an impairment charge in the current period (limited to the amount of goodwill recorded). Based on the results of the 2019 qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill for each geographic reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, we did not perform any quantitative analyses and no impairment charges were recorded. 43 Table of Contents Ind efinite-Lived Intangible Assets . Our intangible assets with an indefinite life are from franchise agreements that we have with state and local governments and the Clearwave trade name. Franchise agreements allow us to contract and operate our business within specified geographic areas. We expect our franchise agreements to provide us with substantial benefit for a period that extends beyond the foreseeable horizon, and we have historically obtained renewals and extensions of such agreements without material modifications to the agreements for nominal costs, and these costs are expensed as incurred. We group the recorded values of our various franchise agreements into geographic divisions or units of account. We currently expect to utilize the Clearwave trade name for a period that extends beyond the foreseeable horizon and expect the cost to maintain such asset to be nominal. We assess the recoverability of our indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1st of each year, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. We evaluate the unit of account used to test for impairment periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur to ensure impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. When performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our franchise agreements primarily based on a multi-period excess earnings method ( MPEEM ) analysis and we estimate the fair value of the Clearwave trade name primarily based on a relief-from-royalty analysis, both of which involve significant judgment. When analyzing the fair values indicated under the MPEEM analysis, we also consider multiples of Adjusted EBITDA generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information. If the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets were determined to be less than the carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets. We performed a qualitative assessment of franchise agreements associated with two of our geographic divisions and the Clearwave trade name in 2019. Based on the assessments, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each unit of account exceeded the carrying value of such assets and, therefore, we did not perform any quantitative analyses. We performed a quantitative assessment of franchise agreements associated with one of our other geographic divisions in 2019 and concluded that the fair value of the unit of account exceeded its carrying value. Therefore, no impairment charges were recorded for any of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2019. Property, Plant and Equipment Our industry is capital intensive, and a significant portion of our resources is spent on capital activities associated with extending, rebuilding and upgrading our network. The following tables present certain information regarding our net property, plant and equipment and our cash paid for property, plant and equipment for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): As of December 31, 2019 2018 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 1,201,271 $ 847,979 Total assets $ 3,151,831 $ 2,303,234 Property, plant and equipment, net as a percentage of total assets 38.1 % 36.8 % Year Ended December 31, Cash Paid for Property, Plant and Equipment 2019 $ 257,841 2018 $ 215,761 2017 $ 175,196 Property, plant and equipment represents the costs incurred in the design, construction and implementation of plant, infrastructure and capacity improvements and upgrades. Costs associated with the installation and upgrade of services and the acquiring and deploying of customer premise equipment, including materials, internal and external labor costs and related indirect and overhead costs, are also capitalized. 44 Table of Contents Capitalized labor costs include the direct costs of engineers and technical personnel involved in the design and implementation of plant and infrastructure; the costs of technicians involved in the installation and upgrades of services and customer premise equipment; and the costs of support personnel directly involved in capitalizable activities, such as project managers and supervisors. These costs are capitalized based on internally developed standards by position which are updated annually (or more frequently if required). These standards are developed utilizing a combination of actual costs incurred where applicable, survey information, operational data and management judgment. Overhead costs are capitalized based on standards developed from historical information. Indirect and overhead costs include payroll taxes; insurance and other benefits; and vehicle, tool and supply expense related to installation activities. Costs for repairs and maintenance, disconnecting service or reconnecting service are expensed as incurred. The estimated useful lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances warrant and such lives are revised to the extent necessary due to changing facts and circumstances. Any changes in estimated useful lives are reflected prospectively. Business Combination Purchase Price Allocation The application of the acquisition method requires the allocation of the purchase price amongst the acquisition date fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Fair values are determined using the income approach, market approach and/or cost approach depending on the nature of the asset or liability being valued and the reliability of available information. The income approach estimates fair value by discounting associated lifetime expected future cash flows to their present value and relies on significant assumptions regarding future revenues, expenses, working capital levels and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value by analyzing recent actual market transactions for similar assets or liabilities. The cost approach estimates fair value based on the expected cost to replace or reproduce the asset or liability and relies on assumptions regarding the occurrence and extent of any physical, functional and/or economic obsolescence. Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recent accounting pronouncements which may be applicable to us are described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
