Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the disclosures under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ significantly from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report or implied by past results and trends. Forward-looking statements are statements that attempt to forecast or anticipate future developments in our business, financial condition or results of operations. See the section titled Forward-Looking Statements that appears at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (unless another date is indicated), and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements in light of future developments. Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are presented in U.S. Dollars (USD). Overview We are a global biotechnology company that develops and commercializes innovative therapies for people with serious and life-threatening rare diseases and medical conditions. We select product candidates for diseases and conditions that represent a significant unmet medical need, have well-understood biology and provide an opportunity to be first-to-market or offer a significant benefit over existing products. Our portfolio consists of several commercial therapies and multiple clinical and pre-clinical product candidates. A summary of our major commercial products, including key metrics, as of December 31, 2018, is provided below: United States United European Orphan States Union Drug Biologic Orphan Drug Exclusivity Exclusivity Exclusivity Major Commercial Products Indication Expiration (1) Expiration (2) Expiration (1) Aldurazyme (laronidase) MPS I (3) Expired Expired Expired Brineura (cerliponase alfa) CLN2 (4) 2024 2029 2027 Kuvan (sapropterin dihydrochloride) PKU (5) Expired Not Applicable (5) 2020 (5) Naglazyme (galsulfase) MPS VI (6) Expired Expired Expired Palynziq (pegvaliase-pqpz) PKU (7) 2025 2030 TBD (7) Vimizim (elosulfase alpha) MPS IVA (8) 2021 2026 2024 (1) See Government Regulation Orphan Drug Designation below for further discussion (2) See Government Regulation Healthcare Reform below for further discussion (3) For the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) (4) For the treatment of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) (5) For the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU). Kuvan, a small molecule therapy, has been granted orphan drug status in the European Union (EU), which together with pediatric exclusivity, confers 12 years of market exclusivity in the EU that expires in 2020. (6) For the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI) (7) For adult patients with PKU. Palynziq (formerly referred to as pegvaliase) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2018 and our European Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) submission for Palynziq was accepted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in March 2018. We expect to learn the status of this MAA during the first half of 2019. (8) For the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis IV Type A (MPS IVA) 57 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) (In millions of U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise disclosed) A summary of our ongoing major development programs, including key metrics as of December 31, 2018, is provided below: Major Product Candidates Target U.S. Orphan EU Orphan in Development Indication Designation Designation Stage Palynziq in Europe PKU Yes Yes EU MAA regulatory review (1) Valoctocogene roxaparvovec Hemophilia A (2) Yes Yes Clinical Phase 3 Vosoritide Achondroplasia Yes Yes Clinical Phase 3 (1) In May 2018, the FDA granted marketing approval for Palynziq in the U.S., and our European MAA submission for Palynziq was accepted by the EMA in March 2018. We expect to learn the status of the MAA during the first half of 2019. (2) Hemophilia A is also called factor VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia. Business Developments We continued to grow our commercial business and advance our product candidate pipeline during 2018. We believe that the combination of our internal research programs, acquisitions and partnerships will allow us to continue to develop and commercialize innovative therapies for people with serious and life-threatening rare diseases and medical conditions. Below is a summary of key business developments: Product Approval Palynziq In May 2018, the FDA approved Palynziq, a PEGylated recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme product, for the treatment of adults with PKU who have inadequate blood phenylalanine control despite prior management with available treatment options including sapropterin. Palynziq was first made available in the U.S. in July 2018. We anticipate an opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the scientific committee of the EMA, on Palynziq Injection for the treatment of patients 16 and older with PKU in the first quarter of 2019. If the CHMP provides a positive opinion in the first quarter of 2019, then in the second quarter of 2019 it is possible that the European Commission (EC) could provide marketing authorization in the EU. Continued Emphasis on Research and Development Valoctocogene roxaparvovec We provided an update on our development of valoctocogene roxaparvovec, a gene therapy program for severe hemophilia A, that we completed enrollment of the initial cohort of patients in our Phase 3 study. Based on the FDA Draft Guidance for Human Gene Therapy for Hemophilia issued in July 2018, we expect that Phase 3 data from this cohort available in 2019 could support submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for valoctocogene roxaparvovec through an accelerated approval pathway. We plan to decide in the second half of 2019 whether we will submit a BLA through an accelerated approval pathway. The complete Phase 3 study is targeting enrollment of 130 patients by mid-year 2019 . Vosoritide We announced that enrollment of the Phase 2 study, a randomized, placebo-controlled study of vosoritide in approximately 70 infants and young children with achondroplasia ages zero to less than 60 months for 52 weeks, is on track, and in the early part of the study, vosoritide has been generally well-tolerated. We provided d ata from the children in the ongoing Phase 2 study, which demonstrated 5.7 centimeters of cumulative additional height gained at 42 months. We expect to have over 5 years of clinical data from this study to corroborate maintenance of effect at the time of possibly filing for marketing authorization . The global Phase 3 study, which is fully enrolled, is a randomized, placebo-controlled study of vosoritide in approximately 110 children with achondroplasia between the ages of 5-14 years. We expect top line results from the 52-week Phase 3 study by the end of 2019. 58 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) (In millions of U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise disclosed) Other Developments Brineura We announced in February 2019 that twenty-three patients in the ongoing open-label extension study treated with Brineura continued to show a reduced rate of decline compared to a natural history cohort of CLN2 disease for three years as measured by the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale. Outlook 2019 In 2019, we will continue to focus on our key operating objectives which include continued progression of our product pipeline and continued uptake of our commercial products. From a research and development (R&D) perspective, we expect to continue to invest in our various ongoing clinical studies, which support both our commercial products and pipeline of new product candidates. We expect to move forward on a number of late-stage clinical studies for new product candidates and plan to file marketing applications for various therapeutic areas. From a commercial perspective, we expect to continue to build-out our commercial organization to support the commercialization of Brineura and Palynziq and the international expansion of Kuvan. We continue to monitor conditions in the macroeconomic environment that could affect our ability to achieve our goals, such as changes in the reimbursement and payer landscape, a worsening of economic conditions in certain key markets, particularly in Europe and Latin America, patent expirations of competitive products and the launch of generic competitors, government pricing pressures internationally and the potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We will adjust our business processes, as appropriate, to attempt to mitigate these risks to our business. We expect that our product pipeline investments and expanding commercial infrastructure will enable us to execute on our 2019 operating objectives. 2018 Financial Highlights Key components of our results of operations include the following: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Net product revenues $ 1,470.4 $ 1,270.4 $ 1,110.4 Cost of sales $ 315.3 $ 241.8 $ 209.6 R&D expense $ 696.3 $ 610.8 $ 661.9 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense $ 604.4 $ 554.3 $ 476.6 Intangible asset amortization and contingent consideration expense $ 48.8 $ 46.5 $ (27.0 ) Impairment of intangible assets $ $ $ 599.1 Gain on sale of intangible assets $ (50.0 ) $ (125.0 ) $ Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ (65.5 ) $ 81.2 $ (200.8 ) Net loss $ (77.2 ) $ (117.0 ) $ (630.2 ) The decrease in Net Loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily attributed to increased sales across all of our products and the U.S. commercial launch of Palynziq, increased benefit from income taxes, partially offset by increased R&D expense for the expansion of our clinical programs and increased SG&A expense primarily due to the Palynziq U.S. commercial launch and European pre-launch activities, market preparation related to valoctocogene roxaparvovec and the continued expansion of marketing activities related to Brineura, which launched commercially in mid-2017. See Results of Operations below for additional information related to the Net Loss fluctuations presented above. On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606) using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition . See Note 4 to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 59 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) (In millions of U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise disclosed) Our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2018, compared to $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2017. We have historically financed our operations primarily through our cash flows from operating activities and the issuance of common stock and convertible debt. We will be highly dependent on our net product revenues to supplement our current liquidity and fund our operations for the foreseeable future. We may in the future elect to supplement this with further debt or equity offerings or commercial borrowing. Further, depending on market conditions, our financial position and performance and other factors, we may in the future choose to use a portion of our cash, cash equivalents or investments to repurchase our convertible debt or other securities. See Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion of our liquidity and capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our net income/loss and affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the critical accounting policies below reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances Inventory Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets Valuation of Contingent Consideration Income Taxes Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances Net Product Revenues Upon adoption of ASC Topic 606, we recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. For Aldurazyme revenues, we receive a payment ranging from 39.5% to 50% on worldwide net Aldurazyme sales by Genzyme Corporation (Genzyme) depending on sales volume, which is included in Net Product Revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Under ASC Topic 606, we recognize our best estimate of the entire revenue that it expects to receive when the product is released and control is transferred to Genzyme. We record Aldurazyme net product revenues based on the estimated variable consideration payable when the product is sold through by Genzyme. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. Differences between the estimated variable consideration to be received from Genzyme and actual payments received are not expected to be material. If actual results vary from our estimates, we will make adjustments, which would affect Net Product Revenues and earnings in the period such variances become known. Prior to adoption of ASC Topic 606, f or Aldurazyme revenues, we only recognized a portion of the tiered payment as product transfer revenue when the product was released to Genzyme because all of our performance obligations were fulfilled at that point, the prices were substantially fixed or determinable and title to, and risk of loss for, the product had transferred to Genzyme. The product transfer revenue only represented the fixed amount per unit of Aldurazyme that Genzyme was required to pay us if the product was unsold by Genzyme. The amount of product transfer revenue was eventually deducted from the calculated royalty recognized when the product was subsequently sold by Genzyme. We recorded the Aldurazyme revenues based on net sales information provided by Genzyme and recorded product transfer revenues based on the fulfillment of Genzyme purchase orders in accordance with the terms of the related agreements with Genzyme. 60 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) (In millions of U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise disclosed) Revenue Related Allowances We record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, and other related charges. Rebates, cash discounts, and distributor fees represent the majority of our gross to net deductions and are recorded in the same period the related sales occur. Rebates include amounts paid to Medicaid, other government programs, certain managed care providers, as well as foreign government rebates. Rebates, cash discounts and distributor fees are estimates based on contractual arrangements or statutory obligations, which may vary by product and payer. Estimation requires evaluation of our historical experience, customer mix, current contractual and statutory obligations, specific known market events and trends and industry data. We evaluate our customer mix to estimate which sales will be subject to rebates and consider changes to government program guidelines that would impact the actual rebates and/or our estimates of which sales qualify for such rebates. We update our estimates and assumptions each quarter based on actual historical experience and record any necessary adjustments to our reserves to reflect current information. We believe the methodologies that we use to estimate allowances are reasonable and appropriate given the facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. The following table summarizes the consolidated activities and ending balances in our revenue related allowances: Accrued rebates, cash discounts and distributor fees Balance at Beginning of Year Provision for Current Period Sales Payments Balance at End of Year Year ended December 31, 2018 $ 51.8 $ 132.6 $ (123.4 ) $ 61.0 Year ended December 31, 2017 43.4 108.5 (100.1 ) 51.8 Year ended December 31, 2016 $ 39.2 $ 81.2 $ (77.0 ) $ 43.4 Inventory Produced Prior to Regulatory Approval When future commercialization for a product candidate is probable and management expects to realize economic benefit in the future, we capitalize pre-launch inventory costs prior to regulatory approval. For inventories that are capitalized in preparation of product launch, management considers a number of factors, including the product candidate current status in the regulatory approval process, results from the related pivotal clinical trial, results from meetings with relevant regulatory agencies prior to the filing of regulatory applications, historical experience, as well as potential impediments to the approval process such as product safety or efficacy, commercialization and market trends. In applying the lower of cost or net realizable value to pre-launch inventory, we estimate a range of likely commercial prices based on our comparable commercial products and consider the product candidate stability data for all of the pre-approval production to date to determine whether there is adequate expected shelf life for the capitalized pre-launch production costs. If the criteria for capitalizing inventory produced prior to regulatory approval are not met, we recognize such costs as R&D expense in the period incurred. As of December 31, 2018, there was no pre-launch inventory on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets We have recorded goodwill and acquired intangible assets primarily related to in-process research and development (IPR&D) projects through acquisitions accounted for as business combinations. When identifiable intangible assets, including IPR&D, are acquired, we determine the fair value of these assets as of the acquisition date. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations if quoted market prices are not available, and the models require significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: estimating the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidate; estimating future cash flows from product sales; developing appropriate probability of success rates for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development; projecting timing of regulatory approval; and risks related to the viabil ity of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. 61 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) (In millions of U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise disclosed) Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting and is not amortized, but subject to impairment testing. We review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We assess goodwill impairment by comparing the fair value of our single reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded. We assess impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets first by performing a qualitative assessment. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount, then we will perform a quantitative assessment and record an impairment loss. We assess definite-lived intangible assets for recoverability when there is an indication of impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition to the carrying amount of the asset or asset group. Any excess of the carrying value of the asset or asset group over its estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss. Valuation of Contingent Consideration Significant estimates and judgments are required in determining the acquisition fair value of any contingent obligations incurred in connection with an acquisition. We estimate the fair value of contingent consideration utilizing a probability-based income approach inclusive of an estimated discount rate. Each period we reassess the fair value of the contingent consideration associated with certain acquisitions and record increases in the fair value as contingent consideration expense and record decreases in the fair value as a reduction of contingent consideration expense. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes to one or multiple inputs including the estimated probability with respect to regulatory approval, changes in the assumed timing of when milestones are likely to be achieved and changes in assumed discount periods and rates. Accordingly, subsequent changes in the underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes to our estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of contingent consideration. We believe the fair value used to record contingent consideration incurred in connection with business combinations is based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation date. Income Taxes We calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect net deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are measured using enacted tax rates. The net deferred tax assets primarily represent the tax benefit of tax credits and timing differences between book and tax recognition of certain revenue and expense items, net of a valuation allowance. When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance for the amount that may not be realized. We utilize financial projections to support our net deferred tax assets, which contain significant assumptions and estimates of future operations. If such assumptions were to differ significantly, it may have a material impact on our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. Changes in our valuation allowance will result in a change to tax expense. We establish liabilities or reduce assets for certain tax position when we believe certain tax position are not more likely than not to be sustained if challenged. Each quarter, we evaluate these uncertain tax position and adjust the related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland. Due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. We cannot predict the form or timing of potential legislative changes that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Management is not aware of any potential changes that would have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 62 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) (In millions of U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise disclosed) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 4 to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition. Results of Operations Net Loss Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $77.2 million, compared to net losses of $117.0 million and $630.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The changes in Net Loss were primarily a result of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Total revenues $ 1,491.2 $ 1,313.6 $ 1,116.9 $ 177.6 $ 196.7 Cost of sales 315.3 241.8 209.6 73.5 32.2 R&D expense 696.3 610.8 661.9 85.5 (51.1 ) SG&A expense 604.4 554.3 476.6 50.1 77.7 Intangible asset amortization and contingent consideration 48.8 46.5 (27.0 ) 2.3 73.5 Impairment of intangible assets 599.1 (599.1 ) Gain on sale of intangible asset (50.0 ) (125.0 ) 75.0 (125.0 ) Other, net (19.1 ) (21.0 ) (27.7 ) 1.9 6.7 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes (65.5 ) 81.2 (200.8 ) (146.7 ) 282.0 Net loss $ (77.2 ) $ (117.0 ) $ (630.2 ) $ 39.8 $ 513.2 Net Product Revenues Net Product Revenues consisted of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Aldurazyme $ 135.1 $ 90.0 $ 93.8 $ 45.1 $ (3.8 ) Brineura 39.9 8.6 31.3 8.6 Firdapse 21.7 18.8 18.0 2.9 0.8 Kuvan 433.6 407.5 348.0 26.1 59.5 Naglazyme 345.9 332.2 296.5 13.7 35.7 Palynziq 12.2 12.2 Vimizim 482.0 413.3 354.1 68.7 59.2 Total net product revenues $ 1,470.4 $ 1,270.4 $ 1,110.4 $ 200.0 $ 160.0 The following is additional discussion of our Net Product Revenue results for our major products: Aldurazyme The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 is attributable to an increase in sales volume and the adoption of ASC Topic 606, which contributed $20.2 million to the increase. Although Genzyme sells Aldurazyme worldwide, the net product revenues earned by us on Genzyme net sales are denominated in USD. The decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to the decreases in shipments to Genzyme, offset in part by the increase in Aldurazyme revenue reported by Genzyme. Aldurazyme revenues reported by Genzyme totaled $233.8 million and $223.3 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Note 4 to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the impact of ASC Topic 606 on our 2018 results. Brineura The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to new patients initiating therapy as the product was commercially launched in mid-2017. 63 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) (In millions of U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise disclosed) Kuvan The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in patients initiating therapy in North America. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to an increase in patients initiating therapy in the U.S. and new patients in the ex-North American territories to which we acquired in 2016. Naglazyme The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to new patients initiating therapy in Turkey and North America and government ordering patterns in the Middle East, partially offset by a decrease due to the impact of government ordering patterns from certain Latin American countries. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to new patients initiating therapy, the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the ordering patterns of central government orders from Latin America and Europe. Palynziq The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to the conversion of clinical patients to commercial Palynziq in the U.S. in 2018 following the commercial launch of Palynziq in July 2018. Vimizim The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 and in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to new patients initiating therapy and government ordering patterns. In certain countries, such as in Latin America, governments place large periodic orders for Naglazyme and Vimizim. The ordering patterns of these large government orders can be inconsistent and can create significant quarter to quarter variation in our revenues . We face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro. We use foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. The following table shows our Net Product Revenues denominated in USD and foreign currencies: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Sales denominated in USD $ 891.7 $ 748.5 $ 643.2 $ 143.2 $ 105.3 Sales denominated in foreign currencies 578.7 521.9 467.2 56.8 54.7 Total net product revenues $ 1,470.4 $ 1,270.4 $ 1,110.4 $ 200.0 $ 160.0 The net impact of foreign currency exchange rates on product sales denominated in currencies other than USD during 2018 was negative by $0.7 million, which was primarily driven by the Brazilian Real . During 2017, the net impact of foreign currency exchange rates was positive by $5.5 million, which was primarily driven by the Brazilian Real and the Euro. During 2016, the net impact of foreign currency exchange rates was negative by $3.6 million, which was primarily driven by the British Pound. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on currency exchange rate risk related to our revenues. Royalty and Other Revenues R oyalty and Other Revenues include royalties on net sales of products to licensees or sublicensees, collaborative agreement revenues and rental income associated with the tenants in our San Rafael, California facility. Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Royalty and other revenues $ 20.9 $ 43.2 $ 6.5 $ (22.3 ) $ 36.7 In 2017 we recognized $31.5 million net upfront license revenue from Sarepta Therapeutics (Sarepta) and $3.8 million in royalty revenue earned on Sarepta net sales during 2017. We expect to continue to earn royalties from third parties in the future. Cost of Sales and Product Gross Margin Cost of Sales includes raw materials, personnel and facility and other costs associated with manufacturing our commercial products. These costs include production materials, production costs at our manufacturing 64 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) (In millions of U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise disclosed) facilities, third-party manufacturing costs, and internal and external final formulation and packaging costs. Cost of Sales also includes royalties payable to third parties based on sales of our products. The following table summarizes our cost of sales and product gross margin: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Total net product revenues $ 1,470.4 $ 1,270.4 $ 1,110.4 $ 200.0 $ 160.0 Cost of sales 315.3 241.8 209.6 73.5 32.2 Product gross margin 79 % 81 % 81 % (2 %) 0 % The 2018 increase in Cost of Sales was primarily attributable to increased Vimizim manufacturing costs and increased sales volume for Aldurazyme. Gross margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the impact of adopting ASC Topic 606 on Aldurazyme net product revenues and increased Vimizim and Naglazyme manufacturing costs. Under ASC 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018, we recognize the full amount of expected Aldurazyme revenue in the same period as related cost of sales. Prior to adoption Aldurazyme gross margins fluctuated depending on the mix of product transfer revenue and variable consideration recognized in the period. Our product gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 remained flat compared to 2016. We expect total product gross margin to remain near 80 percent over the next twelve months. Research and Development R&D expense includes costs associated with the research and development of product candidates and post-marketing research commitments related to our approved products. R&D expense primarily includes preclinical and clinical studies, personnel and raw materials costs associated with manufacturing clinical product, quality control and assurance, other R&D activities, facilities and regulatory costs. We manage our R&D expense by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other similar considerations. We continually review our product pipeline and the development status of product candidates and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the research and development portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business. We continuously evaluate the recoverability of costs associated with pre-launch or pre-qualification manufacturing activities, and if it is determined that recoverability is highly likely and therefore future revenues are expected, the costs subsequently incurred related to pre-launch or pre-qualification manufacturing activities for purposes of commercial sales will likely be capitalized. When regulatory approval and the likelihood of future revenues for a product candidate are less certain, the related manufacturing costs are expensed as R&D expenses. R&D expense increased to $696.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $610.8 million and $661.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. R&D expense consisted of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Palynziq $ 94.8 $ 122.1 $ 88.6 $ (27.3 ) $ 33.5 Valoctocogene roxaparvovec 161.7 118.2 58.9 43.5 59.3 Vosoritide 89.3 55.1 55.8 34.2 (0.7 ) Tralesinidase alfa 82.2 56.0 46.1 26.2 9.9 Brineura 46.9 52.0 77.2 (5.1 ) (25.2 ) Other approved products 70.6 72.1 65.0 (1.5 ) 7.1 Early stage programs 68.2 65.4 55.9 2.8 9.5 Other 82.6 69.9 214.4 12.7 (144.5 ) Total $ 696.3 $ 610.8 $ 661.9 $ 85.5 $ (51.1 ) 2018 compared to 2017 The increase in R&D expense primarily comprised the following: 65 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) (In millions of U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise disclosed) an increase in costs for clinical studies related to our valoctocogene roxaparvovec and vosoritide product candidates; an increase in costs of the manufacturing of our tralesinidase alfa clinical product ; and an increase in costs related to other R&D expenses primarily related to activity for our preclinical programs; partially offset by a decrease in costs related to Palynziq, for which capitalization of manufacturing costs began in the second quarter of 2018 following FDA approval; and a decrease in clinical manufacturing costs related to Brineura. During 2019, we expect our R&D spending to increase over 2018 levels primarily due to our valoctocogene roxaparvovec, vosoritide and other programs progressing in their development. We also expect increased spending on preclinical activities for our early development stage programs and we expect to continue incurring R&D expense for the foreseeable future due to long-term clinical activities related to post-approval regulatory commitments for our approved products. 2017 compared to 2016 The decrease in R&D expense primarily comprised the following: a decrease in costs related to other R&D expense primarily related to R&D spending in 2016 on the Kyndrisa, other exon-skipping, and reveglucosidase alfa development programs, all of which were terminated in 2016; and a decrease in costs related to Brineura, which was approved for marketing in the U.S. and EU in June 2017 and July 2017, respectively. During the second quarter of 2016, we evaluated the facts and circumstances supporting recoverability of pre-launch manufacturing costs related to Brineura and concluded that recoverability was probable, resulting in the decrease in R&D costs as pre-launch manufacturing costs began to be capitalized during 2016. Prior to the second quarter of 2016, Brineura pre-launch manufacturing costs incurred were expensed to R&D expense as significant uncertainty existed over the recoverability of the costs at the time; partially offset by an increase in clinical trial activities related to tralesinidase alfa, Palynziq and valoctocogene roxaparvovec product candidates ; and an increase in pre-clinical activity for our early stage programs. Selling, General and Administrative Sales and Marketing (S&M) expense primarily consisted of employee-related expenses for our sales group, brand marketing, patient support groups and pre-commercialization expenses related to our product candidates. General and administrative (G&A) expense primarily consisted of corporate support and other administrative expenses, including employee-related expenses. SG&A expense increased to $604.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $554.3 million and $476.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. SG&A expenses consisted of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 S&M expense $ 324.2 $ 291.5 $ 252.9 $ 32.7 $ 38.6 G&A expense 280.2 262.8 223.7 17.4 39.1 Total SG&A expense $ 604.4 $ 554.3 $ 476.6 $ 50.1 $ 77.7 66 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) (In millions of U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise disclosed) Components of S&M expense were as follows: Years Ended December 31, S&M expense by product: 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Brineura $ 44.2 $ 31.6 $ 15.4 $ 12.6 $ 16.2 Palynziq 29.4 11.5 3.3 17.9 8.2 Other approved products 208.8 220.8 185.5 (12.0 ) 35.3 Other 41.8 27.6 48.7 14.2 (21.1 ) Total S&M expense $ 324.2 $ 291.5 $ 252.9 $ 32.7 $ 38.6 2018 compared to 2017 The increase in S&M expense was primarily a result of the following: the Palynziq U.S. commercial launch and European pre-launch activities; the continued expansion of marketing activities related to Brineura; and pre-launch activities related to our valoctocogene roxaparvovec product candidate; partially offset by a decrease in marketing activities related to our mature products as resources were shifted toward activities noted above. The increase in G&A expense was primarily due to increased personnel-related costs mainly due to increased headcount to support our growth and other administrative-related costs. We expect SG&A expense to increase in future periods as a result of the continued commercial launch of Palynziq, pre-commercialization efforts related to product candidates, and the continued international expansion of Vimizim and the PKU franchise. 2017 compared to 2016 The increase in S&M expense was primarily a result of the following: an increase in costs related to Kuvan and Vimizim due to continued worldwide expansion of commercial activities; and an increase in costs related to Brineura primarily due to marketing expense related to the commercial launch of Brineura in 2017; partially offset by a decrease in other S&M expenses primarily due to the decrease in S&M activities related to Kyndrisa and other terminated programs. The increase in G&A expense was primarily due to increased personnel-related costs mainly due to increased headcount. Intangible Asset Amortization and Contingent Consideration, Impairment of Intangible Assets and Gain on Sale of Intangible Assets Changes during the periods presented for Intangible Asset Amortization and Contingent Consideration, Impairment of Intangible Assets, and Gain on Sale of Intangible Assets were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Increases (decreases) in the fair value of contingent consideration $ 18.5 $ 10.3 $ (57.2 ) $ 8.2 $ 67.5 Amortization of intangible assets 30.3 36.2 30.2 (5.9 ) 6.0 Total intangible asset amortization and contingent consideration $ 48.8 $ 46.5 $ (27.0 ) $ 2.3 $ 73.5 Impairment of intangible assets $ $ $ 599.1 $ $ (599.1 ) Gain on sale of intangible assets $ (50.0 ) $ (125.0 ) $ $ 75.0 $ (125.0 ) 67 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) (In millions of U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise disclosed) 2018 compared to 2017 Fair value of contingent consideration the changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration in 2018 were attributable to changes in the estimated probability of achieving development milestones based on the current status of the related development programs, which was primarily related to the continued progress of the Palynziq program to support the filing and progress toward approval of the European MAA. Amortization of intangible assets the decrease in 2018 was due to a 2017 impairment of IPR&D assets that we had acquired from Zacharon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Zacharon), as the related development program was terminated. It is our policy to report impairment charges that are not material as a component of Intangible Asset Amortization and Contingent Consideration on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Impairment of Intangible Assets no material impairment charges were recorded in 2018 or 2017. See Note 6 to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our Intangible Assets. Gain on Sale of Intangible Assets we recognized a gain of $50.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 due to a third party achievement of development and regulatory approval milestones related to a previously sold intangible asset. See Note 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 2017 compared to 2016 Fair value of contingent consideration The changes in fair value of contingent consideration in 2017 was primarily attributed to the following: the continued progress of the Palynziq developmental program; and the progress of the talazoparib program being developed by Pfizer Inc.; partially offset by the reversal in 2017 of the fair value of the Firdapse FDA approval milestone due to the reduction of the estimated probability of achieving such milestone prior to its expiration date; and the termination of the Kyndrisa and reveglucosidase alfa development programs in 2016 resulted in the reversal of the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration related to the Prosensa Holding N.V. and Zystor Therapeutics, Inc. acquisitions, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets t he increase in amortization of intangible assets during 2017 was primarily attributable to the impairment of IPR&D assets we acquired from Zacharon Impairment of Intangible Assets no material impairment charges were recorded in 2017. In 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $599.1 million related to the Kyndrisa and other exon and reveglucosidase alfa IPR&D assets based on the termination of the internal development of the respective programs. Gain on Sale of Intangible Assets In December 2017, we sold the Priority Review Voucher (PRV) that we received in connection with the FDA approval of Brineura. In exchange for the PRV, we received lump sum payment of $125.0 million, which was recognized as a gain on the sale of intangible assets. Interest Expense We incur interest expense on our convertible debt. Interest expense consisted of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Coupon interest $ 12.5 $ 10.4 $ 9.6 $ 2.1 $ 0.8 Amortization of debt issuance costs 3.6 3.7 3.4 (0.1 ) 0.3 Accretion of discount on convertible notes 27.6 28.6 26.5 (1.0 ) 2.1 Total interest expense $ 43.7 $ 42.7 $ 39.5 $ 1.0 $ 3.2 The increased interest expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the issuance of our 0.599% senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2024 (the 2024 Notes) in August 2017, partially offset by the maturity of our 0.75% senior subordinated convertible notes, which matured on October 15, 2018 (the 2018 Notes) in October 2018. The increased interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was attributable to the 68 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) (In millions of U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise disclosed) issuance of the 2024 Notes . We expect Interest Expense to decrease moderately over the next 12 months due to the maturity of the 2018 Notes. See Note 12 to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt. Interest Income We invest our cash equivalents and investments in U.S. government securities and other high credit quality debt securities in order to limit default and market risk. Changes during the periods presented for impairment of intangible assets, gain on sale of intangible assets and interest income were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Interest income $ 22.8 $ 14.9 $ 7.5 $ 7.9 $ 7.4 The increase in interest income during 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to a higher investment balance during the period and higher average interest rate on investments. The increase in interest income during 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a higher investment balance, which increased due to the investment of the net proceeds of $481.7 million from our August 2017 issuance of the 2024 Notes and higher average interest rate on investments. We expect Interest Income to decrease moderately over the next 12 months due to the repayment of the 2018 Notes. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. The new law has resulted in significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. These changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21% and the elimination or reduction of certain domestic deductions and credits, including a 50% reduction in the orphan drug credit. The 2017 Tax Act changed U.S. international taxation from a worldwide basis to a modified territorial system that includes base erosion prevention measures on foreign earnings. This resulted in our foreign subsidiaries being subject to U.S. taxation in the future. These changes were effective in 2018. We recognized an income tax benefit of $65.5 million, an income tax expense of $81.2 million and an income tax benefit of $200.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Changes to tax laws and tax rates are required to be accounted for in the period of the enactment, therefore our 2017 tax provision included the impact of the 2017 Tax Act. Provision for (benefit from) income taxes for 2018, 2017 and 2016 consisted of state, federal and foreign current tax expense which was offset by tax benefits related to stock option exercises and deferred tax benefits from federal orphan drug credits, federal R&D credits and California R&D credits. The provision for (benefit from) income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were further impacted by the following items: 2017 included a provisional expense of $42.3 million related to the 2017 Tax Act primarily consisting of $33.1 million for the re-measurement of the net deferred tax assets at the lower enacted corporate tax rate and $9.2 million related to the new limitations on tax deductible compensation. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when these temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. Additionally, we established a $41.4 million valuation allowance on state tax credits as management assessed the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on our financial projections and concluded that it is more likely than not that these state tax credits will not be utilized in the foreseeable future because these credits do not expire and we project that we will be generating more credits than we will utilize on an annual basis. The 2017 Tax Act also includes a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation toll tax on accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that did not impact us due to a net deficit in these foreign subsidiaries. In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. As a result, we previously provided a provisional estimate of the effect of the 2017 Tax Act in our financial statements. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our analysis to determine the effect of the 2017 Tax Act and recorded immaterial adjustments as of December 31, 2018. We have elected to account for Global Intangible Low-taxed Income (GILTI) as a current period expense when incurred. 2016 included a deferred tax benefit of $143.5 million associated with the GAAP impairment of the Kyndrisa IPR&D. 69 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) (In millions of U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise disclosed) The consolidated GAAP net loss includes all of our foreign subsidiaries. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes , we calculate our provision for (benefit from) income taxes on an entity-by-entity and jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis as adjusted for differences between book-basis income and tax-basis income, which results in certain foreign entities being profitable and incurring foreign current income tax expense. Certain foreign entities incur significant amounts of R&D expense that results in significant losses that more than offset the income reported by the profitable foreign entities on a consolidated basis. The majority of these material R&D losses are in foreign jurisdictions that do not have net operating loss carryforward provisions that result in deferred tax assets, which results in an effective tax rate of 0% on approximately $142.0 million of foreign net losses during 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our Dutch operations had GAAP income of $36.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, other foreign operations generated GAAP income of approximately $91.1 million with an effective tax rate of approximately 10.6% . Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. We expect to fund our operations with our net product revenues from our commercial products, cash, cash equivalents and investments, supplemented as may become necessary by proceeds from equity or debt financings and loans, or collaborative agreements with corporate partners. We may require additional financing to fund the repayment of our convertible debt, future milestone payments and our future operations, including the commercialization of our products and product candidates currently under development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, and potential licenses and acquisitions. We will need to raise additional funds from equity or debt securities, loans or collaborative agreements if we are unable to satisfy our liquidity requirements. The timing and mix of our funding options could change depending on many factors, including how much we elect to spend on our development programs, potential licenses and acquisitions of complementary technologies, products and companies or if we elect to settle all or a portion of our convertible debt in cash. In managing our liquidity needs in the U.S., we do not rely on unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds and we have not provided for U.S. federal or state income taxes on these undistributed foreign earnings. We do not record U.S. tax expense on the undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries as these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. Currently, we are not subject to the repatriation tax on foreign earnings due to the net deficit in these foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2018, $156.4 million of our $1.3 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments was held in foreign subsidiaries, a significant portion of which is required to fund the liquidity needs of these foreign subsidiaries. See Note 14 to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding income taxes. We are mindful that conditions in the current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals. We sell our products in countries that face economic volatility and weakness. Although we have historically collected receivables from customers in such countries, sustained weakness or further deterioration of the local economies and currencies may cause customers in those countries to be unable to pay for our products. We will continue to monitor these conditions and will attempt to adjust our business processes, as appropriate, to mitigate macroeconomic risks to our business. Our liquidity and capital resources as of December 31 were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Cash and cash equivalents $ 494.0 $ 598.0 $ 408.3 $ (104.0 ) $ 189.7 Short-term investments 590.3 797.9 381.3 (207.6 ) 416.6 Long-term investments 235.9 385.8 572.8 (149.9 ) (187.0 ) Cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 1,320.2 $ 1,781.7 $ 1,362.4 $ (461.5 ) $ 419.3 Convertible debt, net $ 830.4 $ 1,174.5 $ 683.2 $ (344.1 ) $ 491.3 70 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) (In millions of U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise disclosed) Our cash flows for each of the years ended December 31 are summarized as follows: 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Cash & cash equivalents at the beginning of the period $ 598.0 $ 408.3 $ 397.0 $ 189.7 $ 11.3 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 20.2 (8.8 ) (227.8 ) 29.0 219.0 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 264.4 (305.5 ) (484.0 ) 569.9 178.5 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (388.0 ) 507.1 727.1 (895.1 ) (220.0 ) Foreign exchange impact (0.6 ) (3.1 ) (4.0 ) 2.5 0.9 Cash & cash equivalents at the end of the period $ 494.0 $ 598.0 $ 408.3 $ (104.0 ) $ 189.7 Short-term and long-term investments 826.2 1,183.7 954.1 (357.5 ) 229.6 Cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 1,320.2 $ 1,781.7 $ 1,362.4 $ (461.5 ) $ 419.3 Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $20.2 million, compared to cash used in operating activities of $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributed to the timing of cash receipts from customers and payments to vendors, partially offset by higher inventory levels. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to the increase in Genzyme unbilled receivables due to the adoption of ASC Topic 606. Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $8.8 million, compared to cash used in operating activities of $227.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash used in operating activities was primarily attributed to the timing of cash receipts from customers and payments to vendors, partially offset by higher inventory levels. Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $264.4 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $305.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to $359.0 million in net maturities of available-for-sale debt securities and $50.0 million in milestone payment receipts related to a previously sold intangible asset, partially offset by $144.6 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment. We expect to continue to make significant capital investments in our manufacturing facilities and our corporate headquarters to accommodate anticipated headcount growth. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $305.5 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $484.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to $229.5 million in net purchases of available-for-sale debt securities and $199.2 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by $125.0 million in milestone payment receipts related to a previously sold intangible asset. Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $388.0 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $507.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to the $375.0 million settlement of the 2018 Notes, which matured in October 2018, partially offset by $31.6 million of net proceeds from issuances under our equity incentive plans. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $507.1 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $727.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to $481.7 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, issued in August 2017, and $27.4 million of net proceeds from issuances under our equity incentive plans. 71 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) (In millions of U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise disclosed) Other Information Our $870.0 million (undiscounted) of total convertible debt as of December 31, 2018 will impact our liquidity due to the semi-annual cash interest payments. As of December 31, 2018, our indebtedness consisted primarily of our 1.50% senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2020 (the 2020 Notes) and the 2024 Notes (together with the 2020 Notes, the Notes), which, if not converted, will be required to be repaid in cash at maturity in 2020 and 2024, respectively . See Note 12 to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. Our 2018 Notes matured in October 2018 and were settled with a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, consisting of approximately $375.0 million in cash and 190,220 in shares. The shares issued represented the value of the 2018 Notes in excess of the conversion price of $94.15, as measured over a 25-day averaging period. The cash payment was comprised of the principal, the value of fractional shares and the value of unconverted 2018 Notes. In October 2018, pursuant to a capped call transaction, which was entered into concurrently with the issuance of the 2018 Notes, we received from the capped call counterparties 95,127 shares of our common stock, which was accounted for as treasury shares and subsequently retired. No gain or loss was incurred upon the extinguishment of the 2018 Notes. In the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2020 Notes is triggered, holders of the 2020 Notes will be entitled to convert the 2020 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. In addition, the 2020 Notes will be freely convertible on or after July 15, 2020. We intend to use the remaining balance of the net proceeds we received from the issuance of the 2024 Notes to repay, repurchase or settle in cash some or all of the 2020 Notes. We may elect to settle conversions of the 2020 Notes in cash, in whole or in part, which could further affect our liquidity. While we could seek to obtain additional third-party financing to pay for any amounts due in cash upon such events, we cannot be sure that such third-party financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even if holders of the 2020 Notes do not elect to convert their 2020 Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of such Notes as a current liability rather than long-term liability (for example, when there are twelve months or less remaining until maturity), which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. In August 2017, we completed an offering of $495.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes, which resulted in net proceeds of $481.7 million, after deducting commissions and offering expenses . In August 2016, we sold 7.5 million shares of our common stock at a price of $96.00 per share in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement previously filed with the SEC. We received net proceeds of approximately $712.9 million from this public offering after accounting for the underwriting discount and offering costs. In October 2018, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility of up to $200.0 million (the 2018 Credit Facility) and terminated the credit facility that we entered into in November 2016, which provided for up to $100.0 million in revolving loans (the 2016 Credit Facility). The 2018 Credit Facility includes a letter of credit subfacility and a swingline loan subfacility and is also intended to finance ongoing working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the 2018 Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either (a) the LIBOR rate (except that if LIBOR is less than zero it shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of the 2018 Credit Facility), or LIBOR successor rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.95% per annum, based upon our net leverage ratio and EBITDA for each of the two most recently ended four-quarter measurement periods, or (b) the Base Rate, generally the prime lending rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.95%, based upon our net leverage ratio and EBITDA for each of the two most recently ended four-quarter measurement periods. Commitment fees payable on the undrawn amount range from 0.15% to 0.35% per annum based upon our net leverage ratio and EBITDA for each of the two most recently ended four-quarter measurement periods. Our obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by our direct subsidiary, California Corporate Center Acquisition LLC, and such obligations may in the future be guaranteed from time to time by certain other material domestic subsidiaries. The 2018 Credit Facility matures on October 19, 2021 at which time all outstanding amounts become due and payable, except that if at least $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes remain outstanding on August 1, 2020 and certain other conditions have not been met, we may be required to repay all amounts borrowed under the 2018 Credit Facility on August 1, 2020. We incurred approximately $1.0 million of issuance costs, which will be amortized to Interest expense over the term of the 2018 Credit Facility. We incurred no gain or loss upon the termination of the 2016 Credit facility. The 2018 Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum liquidity requirement. See Note 12 to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. 72 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) (In millions of U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise disclosed) Funding Commitments We cannot estimate with certainty the cost to complete any of our product development programs. Additionally, except as disclosed under Overview above, we cannot precisely estimate the time to complete any of our product development programs or when we expect to receive net cash inflows from any of our product development programs. Please see Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of the reasons we are unable to estimate such information, and in particular the following risk factors: If we fail to obtain regulatory approval to commercially market and sell our product candidates, or if approval of our product candidates is delayed, we will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of these product candidates, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished, and the capital necessary to fund our operations will increase; If we are unable to successfully develop and maintain manufacturing processes for our products to produce sufficient quantities at acceptable costs, we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenue, have reduced margins or be forced to terminate a program; If we fail to compete successfully with respect to product sales, we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses related to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product and our revenue could be adversely affected. If we do not achieve our projected development goals in the timeframes we announce and expect, the commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and, as a result, our stock price may decline. Our investment in our product development programs and continued development of our existing commercial products has a major impact on our operating performance . Our R&D expenses for the period since inception as of December 31, 2018 for certain of our key programs were as follows : Since Program Inception Palynziq $ 617.7 Valoctocogene roxaparvovec 401.0 Vosoritide 319.0 Brineura 287.1 Other approved products 1,050.4 Other Not meaningful We may need or elect to increase our spending above our current long-term plans to be able to achieve our long-term goals. This may increase our capital requirements, including: costs associated with the commercialization of our products additional clinical trials investments in the manufacturing of our commercial products preclinical studies and clinical trials for our other product candidates potential licenses and other acquisitions of complementary technologies, products and companies and general corporate purposes. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: our ability to successfully market and sell our products; the time and cost necessary to develop commercial manufacturing processes, including quality systems, and to build or acquire manufacturing capabilities; the progress and success of our preclinical studies and clinical trials (including studies and the manufacture of materials); the timing, number, size and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials; the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and the costs of post-marketing studies which may be required by regulatory authorities; the progress of research programs carried out by us . 73 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) (In millions of U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise disclosed) Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Contractual and Commercial Obligations We have contractual and commercial obligations under our convertible debt, operating leases and other obligations related to R&D activities, purchase commitments, licenses and sales royalties with annual minimums. Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 are presented in the table below. Payments Due within More 1 Year >1 -3 > 3 - 5 Than 5 or Less Years Years Years Total 2020 Notes and related interest $ 5.6 $ 380.6 $ $ $ 386.2 2024 Notes and related interest 3.0 5.9 5.9 498.0 512.8 Operating leases 13.0 23.7 20.6 27.7 85.0 R&D and purchase commitments 88.3 3.5 91.8 Total $ 109.9 $ 413.7 $ 26.5 $ 525.7 $ 1,075.8 We are also subject to contingent payments related to certain development and regulatory activities and commercial sales and licensing milestones totaling approximately $477.3 million as of December 31, 2018, which are due upon achievement of certain development and commercial milestones, and if they occur before certain dates in the future . Of this amount, $154.5 million relates to remaining amounts due to Ares Trading S.A. (Merck Serono), from whom in 2016 we acquired certain rights and other assets with respect to Kuvan and Palynziq, and $80.7 million relates to programs that are no longer being developed. As of December 31, 2018, we have recorded $132.8 million of contingent consideration on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any outstanding amounts due under the 2018 Credit Facility will be due in full in October 2021 with related interest, if any, due on a quarterly basis, except that if at least $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes remain outstanding on August 1, 2020 and certain other conditions have not been met, we may be required to repay all amounts borrowed under the 2018 Credit Facility on August 1, 2020. As of December 31, 2018 , there was no outstanding balance. 74 Table of Contents It em 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and credit risks. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into foreign currency derivative hedging transactions, follow investment guidelines and monitor outstanding trade receivables as part of our risk management program. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the U.S. as well as sales activities in regions outside the U.S, including Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. As a result, our financial results may be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we sell our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar (USD) and various foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. When the USD strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of the sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the USD weakens against these currencies, the relative value of such sales increases. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker USD and are adversely affected by a stronger USD relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant business. During 2018, approximately 39% of our net product sales were denominated in foreign currencies and 17% of our operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies. To partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses, we may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts (forward contracts). We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities, primarily those denominated in Euros, using forward contracts, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date the transaction is recorded and the date the cash is collected or paid. Generally, the market risks of these contracts are offset by the corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge foreign currency exchange rate exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The counterparties to these forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks, which minimizes the risk of counterparty nonperformance. We regularly review our hedging program and may, as part of this review, make changes to the program. As of December 31, 2018, we had open forward contracts with notional amounts of $418.4 million. A hypothetical 10% strengthening in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the USD relative to exchange rates at December 31, 2018 would have resulted in a reduction in the value received over the remaining life of these contracts by approximately $43.7 million on this date and, if realized, would negatively affect earnings during the remaining life of the contracts. The estimated fair value change was determined by measuring the impact of the hypothetical exchange rate movement on outstanding forward contracts. This analysis does not consider the impact of the hypothetical changes in foreign currency rates would have on the forecasted transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designated to offset. Our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments is subject to assumptions and actual impact could be significantly different. Based on our overall foreign currency exchange rate exposures at December 31, 2018, we believe that a near-term 10% fluctuation of the USD exchange rate could result in a potential change in the fair value of our foreign currency sensitive assets, excluding our investments and open forward contracts by approximately $3.3 million. We expect to continue to enter into transactions based in foreign currencies that could be impacted by changes in exchange rates. Interest Rate Market Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio, which includes our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities. By policy, we place our investments with highly rated credit issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. As stated in our investment policy, we seek to improve the safety and likelihood of preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. 75 Table of Contents We have outstanding $375.0 million (undiscounted) of the 2020 Notes and $495.0 million (undiscounted) of the 2024 Notes. The interest rates on these notes are fixed and therefore they do not expose us to risk related to rising interest rates. As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of our convertible debt was $911.3 million. In connection with the October 2013 offering of the 2018 Notes, which matured in October 2018, and the 2020 Notes, we paid $29.8 million to purchase a capped call covering 3,982,988 shares of our common stock, with 50% related to the 2018 Notes and 50% related to the 2020 Notes. If the per share price of our common stock remains below $94.15, the capped call transaction would be not applicable and, therefore, would provide us no benefit in offsetting potential dilution from the 2020 Notes. If the per share price of our common stock exceeds $121.05, then, to the extent of the excess, the capped call transaction would result in additional dilution from conversion of the 2020 Notes. As of December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio did not include any investments with significant exposure to countries that face economic volatility and weakness. Although not predictive in nature, we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point threshold reflects a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. Based on our investment portfolio and interest rates at December 31, 2018, we believe that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates could result in a potential loss in fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $5.6 million. Changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio. However, we will not recognize such gains or losses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations unless the investments are sold or we determine that the decline in the investment value is other than temporary. The table below summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest-generating investments at December 31, 2018 (in millions): Expected Maturity 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Total Available-for-sale debt securities $ 649.7 $ 182.3 $ 53.4 $ $ $ 0.2 $ 885.6 Average interest rate 2.8 % 3.1 % 3.2 % 5.3 % 2.9 % Counterparty credit risks Our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk that we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring transactions to be with institutions with minimum credit ratings of A or equivalent by Standards & Poor s, Moody's or Fitch. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer.
