Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of Aramark's (the "Company," "we," "our" and "us") financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended September 27, 2024, September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements. Our discussion contains forward-looking statements, such as our plans, objectives, opinions, expectations, anticipations, intentions and beliefs, that are based upon our current expectations but that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under "Risk Factors," "Special Note About Forward-looking Statements" and "Business" sections and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Annual Report"). In the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, certain financial measures may be considered non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules. These rules require supplemental explanation and reconciliation, which is provided elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview We are a leading global provider of food and facilities services to education, healthcare, business & industry and sports, leisure & corrections clients. Our largest market is the United States, which is supplemented by an additional 15-country footprint. We also provide our services on a more limited basis in several additional countries and in offshore locations. Through our established brand, broad geographic presence and employees, we anchor our business in our partnerships with thousands of clients. Through these partnerships we serve millions of consumers including students, patients, employees, sports fans and guests worldwide. We operate our business in two geographic reportable segments: Food and Support Services United States ("FSS United States") - Food, refreshment, specialized dietary and support services, including facility maintenance and housekeeping, provided to business, educational and healthcare institutions and in sports, leisure and other facilities within the United States. Food and Support Services International ("FSS International") - Food, refreshment, specialized dietary and support services, including facility maintenance and housekeeping, provided to business, educational and healthcare institutions and in sports, leisure and other facilities outside of the United States with the largest operations within Canada, Chile, China, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom. Our operations focus on serving clients in five principal sectors: Business & Industry, Education, Healthcare, Sports, Leisure & Corrections and Facilities & Other. Our FSS International reportable segment provides a similar range of services as those provided to our FSS United States clients and operates in the same sectors. Administrative expenses not allocated to our reportable segments are presented separately as corporate expenses. Current Business Environment We continue to see improving inflation trends where inflationary costs in product, energy and labor have moderated over fiscal 2024, particularly in the United States. In addition, we continue to see elevated market interest rates and significant changes in foreign currencies. We expect these conditions to continue in the near-term, and we regularly evaluate and believe we take appropriate actions to mitigate risk in these areas. These actions include management of operating costs, including supply chain initiatives and pricing actions, and managing interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swaps. Sale of San Antonio Spurs NBA Franchise Equity Investment During fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, we sold our ownership interest in the San Antonio Spurs NBA franchise for $101.2 million and $98.2 million, respectively, in cash in taxable transactions resulting in a pre-tax gain of $25.1 million ($19.6 million gain net of tax) in fiscal 2024 and a pre-tax loss of $1.1 million ($2.2 million loss net of tax) in fiscal 2023. See Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements. 26 Table of Contents Separation and Distribution of Aramark Uniform and Career Apparel On September 30, 2023, we completed the separation and distribution of our Aramark Uniform and Career Apparel ("Uniform") segment into an independent publicly traded company, Vestis Corporation ("Vestis"). The separation of our Uniform segment was structured as a tax free spin-off, which occurred by way of a pro rata distribution to Aramark stockholders. Each of the Aramark stockholders received one share of Vestis common stock for every two shares of Aramark common stock held of record as of the close of business on September 20, 2023. Vestis is now an independent public company under the symbol VSTS on the NYSE. The historical results of the Uniform segment have been reflected as discontinued operations in our audited consolidated financial statements for all periods prior to the separation and distribution. Assets and liabilities associated to the Uniform segment are classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in our audited Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 29, 2023. Additional disclosures regarding the separation and distribution are provided in Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements. Sale of AIM Services Co., Ltd Equity Investment During fiscal 2023, we sold our 50% ownership interest in AIM Services Co., Ltd., a leading Japanese food services company, to Mitsui & Co., Ltd. for $535.0 million in cash in a taxable transaction resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of this equity investment of $377.1 million ($278.7 million gain net of tax) (see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements). Acquisition of Union Supply During fiscal 2022, we completed the acquisition of Union Supply Group Inc. ("Union Supply"), a commissary goods and services supplier, for cash consideration of $199.6 million, plus contingent consideration (see Note 3 and Note 17 to the audited consolidated financial statements). Sources of Revenue Our clients engage us, generally through written contracts, to provide our services at their locations. Depending on the type of client and service, we are paid either by our client or directly by the customer to whom we have been provided access by our client. We typically use either profit and loss contracts or client interest contracts. These contracts differ in their provision for the amount of financial risk we bear and, accordingly, the potential compensation, profits or fees we may receive. Under profit and loss contracts, we receive all of the revenue from, and bear all of the expenses of, the provision of our services at a client location. For fiscal 2024, approximately two-thirds of our revenue was derived from profit and loss contracts. Client interest contracts include management fee contracts, under which our clients reimburse our operating costs and pay us a management fee, which may be calculated as a fixed dollar amount or a percentage of revenue or operating costs. Some management fee contracts entitle us to receive incentive fees based upon our performance under the contract, as measured by factors such as revenue, operating costs and customer satisfaction surveys. For fiscal 2024, approximately one-third of our revenue was derived from client interest contracts. Costs and Expenses Our costs and expenses are comprised of cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), depreciation and amortization and selling and general corporate expenses. Cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) consists of direct expenses associated with our operations, which includes food costs, wages, other labor-related expenses (including workers' compensation, severance, state unemployment insurance and federal or state mandated health benefits and other healthcare costs), insurance, fuel, utilities, clothing and equipment. Direct expense related to food costs within cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are offset by rebates, vendor allowances and volume discounts. Depreciation and amortization expenses mainly relate to assets used in generating revenue. Selling and general corporate expenses include sales commissions, severance, share-based compensation and other unallocated costs related to administrative functions including finance, legal and human resources. Interest Expense, net Interest Expense, net, relates primarily to interest expense on long-term borrowings. Interest Expense, net also includes third-party costs associated with long-term borrowings that were capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the borrowing. Provision for Income Taxes The Provision for Income Taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory United States income tax rate due to the effect of state and local income taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, tax credits and certain nondeductible expenses. Our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on recurring and nonrecurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, state and local income taxes, tax audit settlements, share-based award exercise activity and enacted tax legislation, including certain business tax credits. Changes in judgment due to the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of the change. 27 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Fluctuations The impact from foreign currency translation assumes constant foreign currency exchange rates based on the rates in effect for the prior year period being used in translation for the comparable current year period. We believe that providing the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on certain financial results can facilitate analysis of period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year is the fifty-two or fifty-three week period which ends on the Friday nearest to September 30th. The fiscal years ended September 27, 2024, September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 were each a fifty-two week period. Results of Operations Fiscal 2024 Compared to Fiscal 2023 The following tables present an overview of our results on a consolidated and segment basis with the amount of and percentage change between periods for the fiscal years 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions). Fiscal Year Ended Change Change September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 $ % Revenue $ 17,400.7 $ 16,083.2 $ 1,317.5 8.2 % Costs and Expenses: Cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 15,975.0 14,774.7 1,200.3 8.1 % Other operating expenses 719.2 683.5 35.7 5.2 % 16,694.2 15,458.2 1,236.0 8.0 % Operating income 706.5 625.0 81.5 13.0 % Gain on Sale of Equity Investments, net (25.1) (376.0) 350.9 93.3 % Interest Expense, net 366.7 437.5 (70.8) (16.2) % Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 364.9 563.5 (198.6) (35.3) % Provision for Income Taxes from Continuing Operations 103.0 116.4 (13.4) (11.6) % Net income from Continuing Operations $ 261.9 $ 447.1 $ (185.2) (41.4) % Fiscal Year Ended Change Change Revenue by Segment (1) September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 $ % FSS United States $ 12,576.7 $ 11,721.4 $ 855.3 7.3 % FSS International 4,824.0 4,361.8 462.2 10.6 % $ 17,400.7 $ 16,083.2 $ 1,317.5 8.2 % Fiscal Year Ended Change Change Operating Income by Segment September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 $ % FSS United States $ 659.9 $ 650.0 $ 9.9 1.5 % FSS International 187.3 114.5 72.8 63.6 % Corporate (140.7) (139.5) (1.2) (0.9 %) $ 706.5 $ 625.0 $ 81.5 13.0 % (1) As a percentage of total revenue, FSS United States represented 72.3% and 72.9% and FSS International represented 27.7% and 27.1% for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. Consolidated Overview Revenue increased by 8.2% during fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period, which was primarily attributable to base business growth, including volume growth and contract price increases, and net new business. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenue during fiscal 2024 by 1.7%. 28 Table of Contents The following table presents the cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) by segment and as a percent of revenue for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023. Fiscal Year Ended September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) $ % of Revenue $ % of Revenue FSS United States $ 11,432.3 90.9 % $ 10,615.6 90.6 % FSS International 4,542.7 94.2 % 4,159.1 95.4 % $ 15,975.0 91.8 % $ 14,774.7 91.9 % The following table presents the percentages attributable to the components in cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023. Fiscal Year Ended Cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) components September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Food and support service costs 29.9 % 30.0 % Personnel costs (1) 44.5 % 45.1 % Other direct costs (2) 25.6 % 24.9 % 100.0 % 100.0 % (1) Personnel costs decreased as a percentage of total cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) during fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period due to other direct costs increasing at a higher proportion as compared to personnel costs, lower net severance charges ($19.9 million) and moderation of labor inflationary costs. (2) Other direct costs represented a higher proportion of total cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) during fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period driven by increased payments made to clients related to business volume growth in the current year. In addition, fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 were impacted by non-cash income related to the reduction of contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisition earn outs, net of expense ($8.2 million and $85.7 million, respectively) (see Note 17 to the audited consolidated financial statements). Operating income increased by $81.5 million during fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period, which was driven by base business volume growth, cost management, improved supply chain economics and favorable recovery of inflationary costs as compared to the prior year period. The increase in operating income was also attributable to lower net severance charges ($19.9 million), prior year non-cash charges for the impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment related to certain real estate properties ($19.0 million) (see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements) and lower share-based compensation expense ($13.7 million) (see Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements). These increases in operating income more than offset: lower non-cash income from the reduction of the contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisition earn outs, net of expense ($77.5 million) (see Note 17 to the audited consolidated financial statements); prior year income from proceeds associated with possessory interest at one of the National Park sites ($36.3 million) (see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements); higher personnel costs from incentive expenses related to the annual bonus; lower income related to favorable loss experience under our general liability, automobile liability and workers' compensation liability programs when compared to the prior year ($21.1 million); non-cash inventory adjustment based on expected usage for certain products within the Corrections business ($18.2 million); prior year labor related tax credits provided from governmental assistance programs ($12.5 million); and negative impact of foreign currency translation ($12.0 million). During fiscal 2024, we sold our remaining equity investment ownership interest in the San Antonio Spurs NBA franchise in a taxable transaction resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of this equity investment of $25.1 million, which is included in "Gain on Equity Investments, net" on the Consolidated Statements of Income (see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements). During fiscal 2023, we recognized a $377.1 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our 50% ownership interest in AIM Services Co., Ltd., which was partially offset by a $1.1 million pre-tax loss from the sale of a portion of our equity investment in the San 29 Table of Contents Antonio Spurs NBA franchise. The net amount of these transactions is included in "Gain on Equity Investments, net" on the Consolidated Statements of Income (see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements). Interest Expense, net, decreased 16.2% during fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense related to the repayment of the 6.375% Senior Notes due May 1, 2025 ("6.375% 2025 Notes"). Additionally, the decrease was partially offset by the payment of a $23.9 million call premium, $8.3 million of higher non-cash losses for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and transaction costs related to the refinancing and repricing transactions in fiscal 2024 (see Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements) and higher borrowings on the Receivables Facility throughout fiscal 2024. The Provision for Income Taxes for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 was recorded at an effective tax rate of 28.2% and 20.7%, respectively. The higher effective tax rate in the current year compared to the prior year was driven by prior year favorable tax effects from the sale of our equity investment in AIM Services Co., Ltd. (see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements) and a higher prior year reversal of a portion of the Union Supply contingent consideration liability (see Note 17 to the audited consolidated financial statements), as the majority of the gains from these transactions were not subject to tax. Segment Results FSS United States Segment The FSS United States reportable segment consists of five sectors which have similar economic characteristics and comprise a single operating segment. The five sectors of the FSS United States reportable segment are Business & Industry, Education, Healthcare, Sports, Leisure & Corrections and Facilities & Other. Revenue for each of these sectors is summarized as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended Change September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 % Business & Industry $ 1,627.2 $ 1,407.2 15.6 % Education 3,650.4 3,437.0 6.2 % Healthcare (1) 1,620.3 1,667.7 (2.8) % Sports, Leisure & Corrections 3,981.2 3,537.1 12.6 % Facilities & Other (1) 1,697.6 1,672.4 1.5 % $ 12,576.7 $ 11,721.4 7.3 % (1) In fiscal 2024, management began reporting results for healthcare facility services within "Healthcare," whereas the results were previously reported within "Facilities & Other." As such, the "Healthcare" and "Facilities & Other" results for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2023 were recast to reflect this change. The Facilities & Other and Healthcare sectors had high-single digit operating income margins, consistent with prior year. The Education sector had high-single digit operating income margins compared to mid-single digit operating income margins in the prior year. The Sports, Leisure & Corrections sector had mid-single digit operating income margins, consistent with prior year. The Business & Industry sector had mid-single digit operating income margins compared to low-single digit operating income margins in the prior year. FSS United States segment revenue increased by approximately 7.3% during fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to base business growth, including higher volume within our Business & Industry and Sports, Leisure & Corrections sectors. Additionally, contract price increases, especially within our Higher Education and Corrections businesses, contributed to year-over-year growth. The Facilities & Other sector increase was attributable to base business growth, which was partially offset by lost business occurring late in fiscal 2024. The Healthcare sector decrease was primarily attributable to portfolio optimization occurring late in fiscal 2023. Operating income increased by $9.9 million during fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period. The increase was attributable to: base business volume growth, cost management and improved supply chain economics; favorable recovery of inflationary costs as compared to prior year period; prior year non-cash charges for the impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment related to certain real estate properties ($19.0 million) (see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements); and prior year non-cash charges related to information technology assets ($8.2 million). These increases in operating income more than offset the following: 30 Table of Contents lower non-cash income from the reduction of the contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisition earn outs, net of expense ($77.5 million) (see Note 17 to the audited consolidated financial statements); prior year income from proceeds associated with possessory interest at one of the National Park sites ($36.3 million) (see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements); lower income related to favorable loss experience under our general liability, automobile liability and workers' compensation liability programs ($21.1 million); higher personnel costs from incentive expenses related to the annual bonus; and non-cash inventory adjustment based on expected usage for certain products within the Corrections business ($18.2 million). FSS International Segment FSS International segment revenue increased by approximately 10.6% during fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to base business growth, including volume growth and contract price increases, and net new business growth. The growth in revenue was offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation by 6.3%. Operating income increased by $72.8 million during fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period. The increase was mainly attributable to the volume growth in base business, net new business and improved supply chain economics. The increase was also attributable to lower net severance charges ($30.0 million), a prior year non-cash charge for the impairment of certain assets related to a business held-for-sale ($5.2 million) and lower currency translation losses from Argentina hyperinflation ($5.0 million) (see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements). These increases in operating income more than offset the following: prior year labor related tax credits provided from governmental assistance programs ($12.5 million); unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ($11.6 million); decline in profit related to the sale of our 50% ownership interest in AIM Services Co., Ltd.; charges related to a ruling on a foreign tax matter ($6.8 million); and higher personnel costs from incentive expenses related to the annual bonus. Corporate Corporate expenses, those administrative expenses not allocated to the business segments, increased by $1.2 million during fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period. The increase was attributable to higher expenses related to the separation and distribution of the Uniform segment ($9.1 million) (see Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements) and higher personnel costs from incentive expenses related to the annual bonus, partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense ($13.7 million) compared to the prior year period (see Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements). 31 Table of Contents Fiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022 The following tables present an overview of our results on a consolidated and segment basis with the amount of and percentage change between periods for the fiscal years 2023 and 2022 (dollars in millions).

Consolidated Overview Revenue increased by 17.5% during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, which was primarily attributable to growth in base business, including pricing pass-throughs, and net new business. In addition, the Union Supply acquisition contributed an additional 1.5% of revenue in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenue during fiscal 2023 by 1.4%. The following table presents the cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) by segment and as a percent of revenue for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. 32 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 Cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) $ % of Revenue $ % of Revenue FSS United States $ 10,615.6 90.6 % $ 9,159.0 91.3 % FSS International 4,159.1 95.4 % 3,456.5 94.5 % $ 14,774.7 91.9 % $ 12,615.5 92.2 % The following table presents the percentages attributable to the components in cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.

(2) Personnel costs decreased as a percentage of total cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to food and support service costs increasing at a higher proportion as compared to personnel costs. (3) Other direct costs represented a lower proportion of total cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 driven by food and support service costs increasing at a higher proportion as compared to other direct costs. Fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 were impacted by non-cash income related to the reduction of contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisition earn outs, net of expense ($85.7 million and $15.1 million, respectively) (see Note 17 to the audited consolidated financial statements). Operating income increased by $209.6 million during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, which was driven by base business growth, including volume recovery from COVID-19, and effective cost management. The increase in operating income also benefited from higher non-cash income from the reduction of the contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisition earn outs, net of expense ($70.6 million) (see Note 17 to the audited consolidated financial statements), from higher income related to favorable loss experience under our general liability, automobile liability and workers' compensation liability programs in fiscal 2023 when compared to fiscal 2022 ($19.1 million) and higher income from proceeds associated with possessory interest at one of the National Park sites in fiscal 2023 when compared to fiscal 2022 ($17.3 million) (see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements). These increases in operating income more than offset: increased inflationary costs in product, energy and labor; greater labor related tax credits provided from governmental assistance programs in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2023 ($24.1 million); impairment charges of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment and other costs related to certain real estate properties ($19.0 million) (see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements); higher expenses related to the spin-off of the Uniform segment ($14.8 million); higher net severance charges ($13.2 million); and negative impact of foreign currency translation ($9.6 million). During fiscal 2023, we recognized a $377.1 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our 50% ownership interest in AIM Services Co., Ltd., which was partially offset by a $1.1 million pre-tax loss from the sale of a portion of our equity investment in the San Antonio Spurs NBA franchise. The net amount of these transactions is included in "Gain on Equity Investments, net" on the Consolidated Statements of Income (see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements). Interest Expense, net increased 18.8% during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates related to our senior secured term loan facilities, our Receivables Facility and our revolving credit facility. The Provision for Income Taxes for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 was recorded at an effective tax rate of 20.7% and 17.9%, respectively. During fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we recorded an income tax benefit of $3.8 million and $8.5 million, respectively, for the reversal of a valuation allowance at a subsidiary in the FSS International segment driven by our ability to utilize deferred tax assets based on future taxable income expected due to business acquisitions. We also recorded a benefit to 33 Table of Contents the Provision for Income Taxes of $3.8 million during fiscal 2022 due to a state tax law change. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2023 was benefited by the favorable tax effects from the sale of our equity investment in AIM Services Co., Ltd. (see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements) and the reversal of a portion of the Union Supply contingent consideration liability (see Note 17 to the audited consolidated financial statements), as the majority of the gains from these transactions were not subject to tax. Segment Results FSS United States Segment The FSS United States reportable segment consists of five sectors which have similar economic characteristics and comprise a single operating segment. The five sectors of the FSS United States reportable segment are Business & Industry, Education, Healthcare, Sports, Leisure & Corrections and Facilities & Other. Revenue for each of these sectors is summarized as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended Change September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 % Business & Industry $ 1,407.2 $ 1,081.2 30.2 % Education 3,437.0 3,161.5 8.7 % Healthcare (1) 1,667.7 1,581.4 5.5 % Sports, Leisure & Corrections 3,537.1 2,722.0 29.9 % Facilities & Other (1) 1,672.4 1,484.7 12.6 % $ 11,721.4 $ 10,030.8 16.9 % (1) In fiscal 2024, management began reporting results for healthcare facility services within "Healthcare," whereas the results were previously reported within "Facilities & Other." As such, the "Healthcare" and "Facilities & Other" results for the fiscal years ended September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 were recast to reflect this change. The Healthcare and Facilities & Other sectors had high-single digit operating income margins, consistent in both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. The Education and Sports, Leisure & Corrections sectors had mid-single digit operating income margins, consistent in both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. The Business & Industry sector had low-single digit operating income margins in fiscal 2023 compared to negative low-single digit operating income margins in fiscal 2022. During the COVID-19 pandemic and in following periods, operating income margin in certain sectors within the FSS United States reportable segment have differed from our otherwise historical patterns, particularly in the Business & Industry sector. FSS United States segment revenue increased by approximately 16.9% during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to base business growth, including contract price increases mainly within the Corrections and Higher Education businesses, and net new business growth. The Sports, Leisure & Corrections sector increased due to higher per capita customer spending in stadiums and arenas and the acquisition of Union Supply, which contributed an additional 2.0% of revenue during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. The Business & Industry sector increased due to client personnel continuing to return to office locations. Operating income increased by $214.9 million during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was attributable to: base business growth, including volume recovery from COVID-19, and effective cost management; higher non-cash income from the reduction of the contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisition earn outs, net of expense ($70.6 million) (see Note 17 to the audited consolidated financial statements); higher income related to favorable loss experience under our general liability, automobile liability and workers' compensation liability programs when compared to fiscal 2022 ($19.1 million); higher income from proceeds associated with possessory interest at one of the National Park sites when compared to fiscal 2022 ($17.3 million) (see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements); and higher income attributed to the Union Supply acquisition as compared to fiscal 2022 ($10.6 million). These increases in operating income more than offset the following: increased inflationary costs in food and labor; non-cash charges for the impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment related to certain real estate properties ($19.0 million) (see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements); and non-cash charge for the impairment of computer software assets ($8.2 million). 34 Table of Contents FSS International Segment FSS International segment revenue increased by approximately 19.3% during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to base business growth, including contract price increases, and net new business growth. The growth in revenue was offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation by 5.0%. Operating income increased by $2.0 million during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was attributable to growth in base and net new business and lower personnel costs from headcount reductions taken during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and late fiscal 2022. These increases in operating income more than offset the following: increased inflationary costs in product and labor; greater labor related tax credits provided from governmental assistance programs in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2023 ($24.1 million); higher net severance charges ($18.0 million); favorable impact related to a client contract dispute in fiscal 2022 ($9.6 million); unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ($7.8 million); decline in profit related to the sale of our 50% ownership interest in AIM Services Co., Ltd.; higher currency translation losses from Argentina hyperinflation ($7.0 million) (see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements); and non-cash charges for the impairment of certain assets related to a business that was sold ($5.2 million). Corporate Corporate expenses, those administrative expenses not allocated to the business segments, increased by $7.3 million during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The increase in corporate expenses was attributable to higher expenses related to the separation and distribution of the Uniform segment compared to prior year period ($14.8 million). These increases in corporate expenses were partially offset by lower share-based compensation expenses ($6.0 million) when compared to fiscal 2022 (see Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements). Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operating activities, funds from borrowings, investments in marketable securities and existing cash on hand. As of September 27, 2024, we had $672.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $42.3 million of marketable securities, $1,341.6 million of availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility and $600.0 million of availability under the Receivables Facility. A significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents are held in mature, liquid geographies where we have operations. As of September 27, 2024, there were $733.3 million of outstanding foreign currency borrowings. As of September 27, 2024, the 5.000% Senior Notes due April 1, 2025 and 3.125% Senior Notes due April 1, 2025 mature within one year. We intend to repay, redeem or otherwise refinance the outstanding obligations related to these securities. On August 2, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 15 to the Credit Agreement, which refinanced and replaced our approximately $1.2 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility and approximately $225 million Term A Loans due April 2026 into an amended $1.4 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility and $500 million Term A Loans, extending the maturity to August 2029. In addition, Amendment No. 15 increases the revolving credit facility capacity by approximately $250 million and reduces the applicable margin. We utilized the net proceeds from the increased principal amount of Term A Loans to reduce the outstanding revolving credit facility balance by approximately $275 million (see Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements). On November 5, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $500 million of Aramark's outstanding common stock. The share repurchase program does not have a fixed expiration date. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under our revolving credit facility and Receivables Facility will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future to fund working capital, capital spending, debt service obligations, refinancings, dividends and other cash needs. We also have flexibility to optimize working capital and defer certain capital expenditures as appropriate without a material impact to the business. We believe that our assumptions used to estimate our liquidity and working capital requirements are reasonable. For additional information regarding the risks associated with our liquidity and capital resources, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors." 35 Table of Contents The table below summarizes our cash activity (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities of Continuing Operations $ 726.5 $ 511.6 $ 463.9 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities of Continuing Operations (415.9) 223.7 (745.2) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities of Continuing Operations (1,561.2) 659.6 (34.6) Reference to the audited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows will facilitate understanding of the discussion that follows. Fiscal 2024 Compared to Fiscal 2023 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased by $214.9 million during fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period. The change was driven by higher net income, inclusive of the add-back of non-cash gains and losses and adjustments to non-operating cash transactions, in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period, as discussed in "Results of Operations" above. Additionally, cash provided by operating activities was favorably impacted by the change in operating assets and liabilities compared to the prior year period by $33.9 million, which was primarily due to: Receivables by $78.1 million, resulting in a lower use of cash during fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period due to higher revenue growth in the prior year period as compared to fiscal 2024 and timing of collections; and Inventories by $31.5 million, resulting in a lower use of cash during fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period due to improved inventory management in the Sports, Leisure & Corrections sector. These changes in operating assets and liabilities more than offset accrued expenses by $72.8 million resulting in a lower source of cash during fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the increase in income tax payments, higher commission payments in our Sports & Entertainment business, timing of interest payments on lower borrowings, lower advances received in our Higher Education business, the timing of insurance and other payments; partially offset by lower payments related to the annual bonus and timing of payroll taxes. During fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, we received proceeds of $6.5 million and $21.4 million, respectively, related to favorable loss experience in older insurance years under our general liability, automobile liability and workers' compensation programs. "Payments made to clients on contracts" generated a higher use of cash during fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to contract renewals and new business. The "Other operating activities" caption in both periods reflects adjustments to net income in the current year and prior year periods related to non-cash gains and losses and adjustments to non-operating cash transactions. Cash Flows (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities The net cash flows used in investing activities during fiscal 2024 was primarily impacted by purchases of property and equipment and other ($427.4 million), acquisitions of certain businesses ($148.7 million) and purchases of United States Treasury securities related to our captive insurance subsidiary ($113.3 million), partially offset by proceeds from the maturity of United States Treasury securities related to our captive insurance subsidiary ($186.4 million) and proceeds from sale of equity investments ($101.2 million) (see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements). The net cash flows provided by investing activities during fiscal 2023 was primarily impacted by proceeds from the sales of equity investments ($633.2 million) (see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements) and proceeds from the maturity of United States Treasury securities related to our captive insurance subsidiary ($80.0 million), partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and other ($383.5 million), purchases of United States Treasury securities related to our captive insurance subsidiary ($110.0 million) and acquisitions of certain businesses ($50.2 million). The "Other investing activities" caption during fiscal 2023 includes $37.6 million of proceeds received relating to possessory interest at one of the National Park sites within our Sports, Leisure & Corrections sector. 36 Table of Contents Cash Flows (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities During fiscal 2024, cash used in financing activities was impacted by the following: repayment of the 6.375% 2025 Notes ($1,500.0 million); repayment of foreign denominated term loans due 2026 ($259.4 million); repayments under the revolving credit facility ($166.1 million); and payments of dividends ($99.9 million). Cash used in financing activities more than offset proceeds from the issuance of new domestic and foreign term loans due 2029 ($499.1 million). See Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information on borrowing activities during fiscal 2024. During fiscal 2023, cash provided by financing activities was impacted by the following: distribution from Vestis prior to the separation and distribution ($1,456.7 million); proceeds from issuance of new United States Term B-6 Loans due 2030 ($1,089.0 million); and borrowings under the revolving credit facility ($101.4 million).

The "Other financing activities" caption also reflects a use of cash during fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, primarily related to taxes paid by us when we withhold shares upon an employee's exercise or vesting of equity awards to cover income taxes. Fiscal 2024 also includes the payment of a call premium on the 6.375% 2025 Notes ($23.9 million) and debt issuance costs mainly related to the refinancing of the revolving credit facility and Term A Loans ($8.5 million). Fiscal 2023 also includes debt issuance costs of $8.2 million related to United States Term B-6 Loans due 2030. We intend to continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock, subject to our compliance with applicable law, and depending on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements, business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. However, the payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and our Board of Directors may, at any time, determine not to continue to declare quarterly dividends. Fiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased by $47.7 million during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The change was driven by higher net income, inclusive of non-cash adjustments, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, as discussed in "Results of Operations" above. Additionally, cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2023 was favorably impacted by the change in operating assets and liabilities compared to fiscal 2022 by $36.4 million, which was primarily due to: Receivables by $232.9 million, resulting in a lower use of cash during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 as the prior year period had a higher use of cash from operations returning following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. Both periods were impacted by base and new business growth and timing of collections; Accrued expenses by $46.5 million generating a greater source of cash during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to timing of deferred income payments, growth in business operations, higher net severance charges recorded in fiscal 2023 and timing of other payments, which more than offset higher interest payments on borrowings; and Inventories by $42.1 million, resulting in a lower use of cash during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 as the prior year period was impacted from operations returning following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. These changes in operating assets and liabilities more than offset accounts payable by $276.9 million, resulting in a lower source of cash during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 from the timing of disbursements. 37 Table of Contents During fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we received proceeds of $21.4 million and $1.9 million, respectively, related to favorable loss experience in older insurance years under our general liability, automobile liability and workers' compensation programs. "Payments made to clients on contracts" generated a higher use of cash during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to contract renewals and new business. Fiscal 2022 included $51.8 million of proceeds associated with labor related tax credits from many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as a form of relief from COVID-19. The "Changes in other assets" caption was driven by higher amortization of client investments due to an increase in investments related to base and new business growth, which more than offset higher cash distributions received from our 50% ownership interest in AIM Services Co., Ltd. in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2023. The "Other operating activities" caption reflects mainly adjustments to net income in the current year and prior year periods related to certain non-cash gains and losses and adjustments to non-operating cash gains and losses.

The indentures governing our senior notes contain similar provisions. As of September 27, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants. As stated above, the Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes contain provisions that restrict our ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock (collectively, "Restricted Payments"). In addition to customary exceptions, the Credit Agreement and indentures permit Restricted Payments in the aggregate up to an amount that increases quarterly by 50% of our Consolidated Net Income, as such term is defined in these debt agreements, subject to being in compliance with the interest coverage ratio described below. Under the Credit Agreement, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests and covenants. The indentures governing our senior notes also require us to comply with certain financial ratios in order to take certain actions. Our continued ability to meet those financial ratios, tests and covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios, tests and covenants. These financial ratios, tests and covenants involve the calculation of certain measures that we refer to in this discussion as "Covenant Adjusted EBITDA." Covenant Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). Covenant Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income of Aramark Services, Inc. ("ASI") and its restricted subsidiaries plus interest expense, net, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to give effect to adjustments required in calculating covenant ratios and compliance under our Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes. Our presentation of these measures has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. You should not consider these measures as alternatives to net income or operating income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Covenant Adjusted EBITDA, as presented by us, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies because not all companies use identical calculations. The following is a reconciliation of Net income attributable to ASI stockholder, which is a U.S. GAAP measure of ASI''s operating results, to Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as defined in our debt agreements. The terms and related calculations are defined in the Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes. Covenant Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of ASI and its restricted subsidiaries only and does not include the results of Aramark. The Covenant Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2023 includes the reported results of the Uniform segment prior to the spin-off. Twelve Months Ended (in millions) September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Net income attributable to ASI stockholders $ 262.5 $ 674.1 Interest expense, net 366.7 439.6 Provision for income taxes 103.0 177.6 Depreciation and amortization 435.5 546.4 Share-based compensation expense (1) 62.6 86.9 Unusual or non-recurring (gains) and losses (2) (22.8) (422.6) Pro forma EBITDA for certain transactions (3) 0.8 4.0 Other (4)(5) 126.7 100.7 Covenant Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,335.0 $ 1,606.7 (1) Represents share-based compensation expense resulting from the application of accounting for stock options, restricted stock units, performance stock units, deferred stock units awards and employee stock purchases (see Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements). (2) The twelve months ended September 27, 2024 represents the pre-tax gain from the sale of our remaining equity investment in the San Antonio Spurs NBA franchise ($25.1 million) and the non-cash charge for the impairment of 39 Table of Contents certain assets related to a business that was sold ($2.3 million). The twelve months ended September 29, 2023 represents the pre-tax gain from the sale of our equity method investment in AIM Services, Co., Ltd. ($377.1 million), the pre-tax gain from the sale of our equity investment in a foreign company ($51.8 million), the non-cash charge for the impairment of certain assets related to a business that was sold ($5.2 million) and the pre-tax loss from the sale of a portion of our equity investment in the San Antonio Spurs NBA franchise ($1.1 million). (3) Represents the annualizing of net EBITDA from certain acquisitions and divestitures made during the period. (4) "Other" for the twelve months ended September 27, 2024 includes adjustments to remove the impact attributable to the adoption of certain accounting standards that are made to the calculation in accordance with the Credit Agreement and indentures ($52.2 million), charges related to our spin-off of the Uniform segment ($29.0 million), non-cash adjustments to inventory based on expected usage ($21.7 million), severance charges ($13.0 million), the reversal of contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisition earn outs, net of expense ($8.1 million), charges related to a ruling on a foreign tax matter ($6.8 million), the impact of hyperinflation in Argentina ($5.4 million), non-cash charges related to the impairment of a trade name ($3.3 million), income related to non-United States governmental wage subsidies ($1.1 million) and other miscellaneous expenses. (5) "Other" for the twelve months ended September 29, 2023 includes the reversal of contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisition earn outs, net of expense ($85.7 million), charges related to our spin-off of the Uniform segment ($51.1 million), adjustments to remove the impact attributable to the adoption of certain accounting standards that are made to the calculation in accordance with the Credit Agreement and indentures ($47.5 million), net severance charges ($37.5 million), non-cash charges for the impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment related to certain real estate properties ($29.3 million), income related to non-United States governmental wage subsidies ($12.5 million), the impact of hyperinflation in Argentina ($10.4 million), non-cash charges related to information technology assets ($8.2 million), the gain from the sale of land ($6.8 million), net multiemployer pension plan withdrawal charges ($5.9 million), labor charges and other expenses associated with closed or partially closed locations from adverse weather ($5.4 million), legal settlement charges ($2.7 million), non-cash charges for inventory write-downs ($2.6 million), the gain from the change in fair value related to certain gasoline and diesel agreements ($1.9 million) and other miscellaneous expenses. Our covenant requirements and actual ratios for the twelve months ended September 27, 2024 are as follows: Covenant Requirements Actual Ratios Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio (1) 5.125x 1.99x Interest Coverage Ratio (Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio) (2) 2.000x 3.73x (1) The Credit Agreement requires ASI to maintain a maximum Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, defined as consolidated total indebtedness secured by a lien to Covenant Adjusted EBITDA, not to exceed 5.125x. Consolidated total indebtedness secured by a lien is defined in the Credit Agreement as total indebtedness consisting of debt for borrowed money, finance leases, debt in respect of sales-leaseback transactions, disqualified and preferred stock and advances under the Receivables Facility secured by a lien reduced by the amount of cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets that is free and clear of any lien. Non-compliance with the maximum Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio could result in the requirement to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement, which, if ASI's lenders under our Credit Agreement (other than the lenders in respect of ASI's United States Term B Loans, which lenders do not benefit from the maximum Consolidated Debt Ratio covenant) failed to waive any such default, would also constitute a default under the indentures governing our senior notes. (2) Our Credit Agreement establishes an incurrence-based minimum Interest Coverage Ratio, defined as Covenant Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense, the achievement of which is a condition for us to incur additional indebtedness and to make certain restricted payments and does not result in a default under the Credit Agreement or the indentures governing the senior notes. If we do not maintain this minimum Interest Coverage Ratio calculated on a pro forma basis for any such additional indebtedness or restricted payments, we could be prohibited from being able to (1) incur additional indebtedness, other than the incremental capacity provided for under the Credit Agreement and pursuant to specified exceptions, and (2) make certain restricted payments, other than pursuant to certain exceptions. However, any failure to maintain the minimum Interest Coverage Ratio would not result in a default or an event of default under either the Credit Agreement or the indentures governing the senior notes. The minimum Interest Coverage Ratio is at least 2.000x for the term of the Credit Agreement. Consolidated interest expense is defined in the Credit Agreement as consolidated interest expense excluding interest income, adjusted for acquisitions and dispositions and for certain non- 40 Table of Contents cash or nonrecurring interest expense. The indentures governing our senior notes include a similar requirement which is referred to as a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. We and our subsidiaries and affiliates may from time to time, in our sole discretion, purchase, repay, redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt securities (including any publicly issued debt securities), in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, or extend or refinance any of our outstanding indebtedness. The following table summarizes our future obligations for debt repayments, finance leases, estimated interest payments, future minimum rental and similar commitments under noncancelable operating leases as well as contingent obligations related to outstanding letters of credit and guarantees as of September 27, 2024 (dollars in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations as of September 27, 2024 Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Long-term borrowings (1) $ 5,262,913 $ 959,410 $ 914,641 $ 2,357,612 $ 1,031,250 Finance lease obligations 62,051 8,104 13,192 5,936 34,819 Estimated interest payments (2) 633,200 106,000 275,600 214,200 37,400 Operating leases and other noncancelable commitments 342,138 66,067 107,020 72,623 96,428 Purchase obligations (3) 958,969 431,560 272,828 90,391 164,190 Other liabilities (4) 555,814 167,322 112,289 28,715 247,488 $ 7,815,085 $ 1,738,463 $ 1,695,570 $ 2,769,477 $ 1,611,575 Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period Other Commercial Commitments as of September 27, 2024 Total Amounts Committed Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Letters of credit $ 85,308 $ 65,308 $ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ (1) Excludes the $22.7 million reduction to long-term borrowings from debt issuance costs, $8.8 million reduction from the discount on the United States Term B-8 Loans due 2030 and $0.4 million reduction from the discount on the United States Term B-4 Loans due 2027. (2) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements and reflect any current hedging arrangements. Payments related to variable debt are based on applicable rates at September 27, 2024 plus the specified margin in the associated debt agreements for each period presented. The amounts provided relate only to existing debt obligations and do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such debt. The weighted average debt balance for each fiscal year from 2025 through 2030 is $4,835.4 million, $4,316.2 million, $3,854.5 million, $2,272.3 million, $1,284.5 million and $536.6 million, respectively. The weighted average interest rate of our existing debt obligations for each fiscal year from 2025 through 2030 is 2.19%, 2.97%, 3.83%, 5.53%, 6.89% and 6.96%, respectively (see Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the terms and maturities of existing debt obligations). (3) Represents mainly the commitments for capital projects to help finance improvements or renovations at the facilities in which we operate. (4) Includes certain unfunded employee retirement obligations, contingent consideration obligations related to acquisitions, self-insurance obligations, and other obligations. We have excluded from the table above uncertain tax liabilities due to the uncertainty of the amount and period of payment. As of September 27, 2024, we have gross uncertain tax liabilities of $70.2 million (see Note 11 to the audited consolidated financial statements). We have a Receivables Facility agreement with four financial institutions where we sell on a continuous basis an undivided interest in all eligible accounts receivable, as defined in the Receivables Facility. The maximum amount available under the Receivables Facility as of September 27, 2024 is $600.0 million. As of September 27, 2024, there are no outstanding borrowings under the Receivables Facility. Amounts borrowed under the Receivables Facility may fluctuate monthly based on our funding requirements and the level of qualified receivables available to collateralize the Receivables Facility. Pursuant to the Receivables Facility, we formed ARAMARK Receivables, LLC, a wholly-owned, consolidated, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary. ARAMARK Receivables, LLC was formed for the sole purpose of buying and selling receivables generated by certain of our subsidiaries. Under the Receivables Facility, we and certain of our subsidiaries transfer without recourse all of 41 Table of Contents our accounts receivable to ARAMARK Receivables, LLC. As collections reduce previously transferred interests, interests in new, eligible receivables are transferred to ARAMARK Receivables, LLC, subject to meeting certain conditions. Supplemental Consolidating Information Pursuant to Regulation S-X Rule 13-01, which simplified certain disclosure requirements for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities, we are no longer required to provide condensed consolidating financial statements for Aramark and its subsidiaries, including the guarantors and non-guarantors under our Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes. ASI, the borrower under our Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes, and its restricted subsidiaries together comprise substantially all of our assets, liabilities and operations, and there are no material differences between the consolidating information related to Aramark and Aramark Intermediate Holdco Corporation, the direct parent of ASI and a guarantor under our Credit Agreement, on the one hand, and ASI and its restricted subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. Other Our business activities do not include the use of unconsolidated special purpose entities and there are no significant business transactions that have not been reflected in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements. We insure portions of our risk related to general liability, automobile liability, workers compensation liability claims as well as certain property damage risks through a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary (the "Captive") as part of our approach to risk finance. The Captive is subject to the regulations within its domicile of Bermuda, including regulations established by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the "BMA") relating to levels of liquidity and solvency as such concepts are defined by the BMA. The Captive was in compliance with these regulations as of September 27, 2024. These regulations may have the effect of limiting our ability to access certain cash and cash equivalents held by the Captive for uses other than for the payment of our general liability, automobile liability, workers compensation liability, certain property damage and related Captive costs. As of September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, cash and cash equivalents at the Captive were $94.7 million and $32.8 million, respectively. The Captive also invests in United States Treasury securities where the amount of these investments as of September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023 was $42.3 million and $110.7 million, respectively, and recorded in "Prepayments and other current assets" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Critical Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. In preparing our financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that, among other things, affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are most significant where they involve levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or matters susceptible to change, and where they can have a material impact on our financial condition and operating performance. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. Critical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions warrant, and changes to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed conditions require. Asset Impairment Determinations Indefinite lived intangible assets that are not amortized are subject to an impairment test that we conduct annually or more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists. For goodwill, we perform the assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The impairment test may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Examples of qualitative factors include, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, entity-specific events, events affecting reporting units and sustained changes in our stock price. If results of the qualitative assessment indicate a more likely than not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed, a quantitative test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow method or market method for each reporting unit with its estimated net book value. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we performed the annual impairment test for goodwill for each of our reporting units using a quantitative testing approach. Based on the evaluation performed, we determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units significantly exceeded its respective carrying amount, and therefore, we determined that goodwill was not impaired. The determination of fair value for each reporting unit includes assumptions, which are considered Level 3 inputs, that are subject to risk and uncertainty. The discounted cash flow calculations are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows, the underlying margin projection assumptions, future growth rates and the discount rate. The 42 Table of Contents market based method is dependent on several subjective factors including the determination of market multiples and future cash flows. If our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change or if future cash flows, margin projections or future growth rates vary from what was expected, this may impact our impairment analysis and could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and result in a decline in fair value that may trigger future impairment charges. With respect to our other long-lived assets, we are required to test for asset impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present, we compare the sum of the future expected cash flows from the asset, undiscounted and without interest charges, to the asset carrying value. If the sum of the future expected cash flows from the asset is less than the carrying value, an impairment would be recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset. In making future cash flow analyses of various assets, we make assumptions relating to the following: the intended use of assets and the expected future cash flows resulting directly from such use; comparable market valuations of businesses similar to Aramark's business segments; industry specific economic conditions; competitor activities and regulatory initiatives; and client and customer preferences and behavior patterns. We believe that an accounting estimate relating to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to change from time to time and the recognition of an impairment could have a significant impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Litigation and Claims From time to time, we and our subsidiaries are party to various legal actions, proceedings and investigations involving claims incidental to the conduct of our business, including actions by clients, customers, employees, government entities and third parties, including under federal, state, international, national, provincial and local employment laws, wage and hour laws, discrimination laws, immigration laws, human health and safety laws, import and export controls and customs laws, environmental laws, ESG-related non-financial disclosure laws, false claims or whistleblower statutes, minority, women and disadvantaged business enterprise statutes, tax codes, antitrust and competition laws, consumer protection statutes, procurement regulations, intellectual property laws, food safety and sanitation laws, cost and accounting principles, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, other anti-corruption laws, lobbying laws, motor carrier safety laws, data privacy and security laws and alcohol licensing and service laws, or alleging negligence and/or breach of contractual and other obligations. We consider the measurement of litigation reserves as a critical accounting estimate because of the significant uncertainty in some cases relating to the outcome of potential claims or litigation and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of potential liability involved, coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from litigation or other claims. In determining legal reserves, we consider, among other issues: interpretation of contractual rights and obligations; the status of government regulatory initiatives, interpretations and investigations; the status of settlement negotiations; prior experience with similar types of claims; whether there is available insurance; and advice of counsel. We were involved in a dispute with a client regarding our provision of services pursuant to a contract. During fiscal 2022, we resolved the matter by entering into a settlement agreement with the client whereby our obligations totaled $13.6 million, resulting in a reversal of previously reserved amounts of $5.7 million, which is included in "Cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)" on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Self-Insurance Reserves We self-insure for obligations related to certain risks that we retain under our casualty program, which includes general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation liability, as well as for certain property damage risks and employee healthcare benefit programs. The accounting estimates related to our self-insurance reserves are critical accounting estimates because changes in our claim experience, our ability to settle claims or other estimates and judgments we use could potentially have a material impact on our results of operations. Our reserves for retained costs associated with our casualty program are estimated through actuarial methods, with the assistance of third-party actuaries, using loss development assumptions based on 43 Table of Contents our claims history. Our casualty program reserves take into account reported claims as well as incurred-but-not-reported losses using loss development factors based upon past experience. In order to determine the loss development factors, we make judgments relating to the nature, frequency, severity, and age of claims, and industry, regulatory and company-specific trends impacting the development of claims. The actual cost to settle our self-insured casualty claim liabilities can differ from our reserve estimates because of a number of uncertainties, including the inherent difficulty in estimating the severity of a claim and the potential amount to defend and settle a claim. As of September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, our self-insurance reserves were $248.6 million and $262.0 million, respectively. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We record valuation allowances for our net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income measured at pre-tax income adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information. As of September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, our valuation allowance reserves recorded against deferred tax assets were $80.6 million and $78.2 million, respectively (see Note 11 to the audited consolidated financial statements). 44 Table of Contents New Accounting Standards Updates See Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting standards updates, including the expected dates of adoption.
