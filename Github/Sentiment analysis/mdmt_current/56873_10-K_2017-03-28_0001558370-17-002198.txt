ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of The Kroger Co. should be read in conjunction with the Forward-looking Statements section set forth in Part I, the Risk Factors section set forth in Item 1A of Part I and the Outlook section below. OUR BUSINESS The Kroger Co. was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902. Kroger is one of the world largest retailers, as measured by revenue, operating 2,796 supermarkets under a variety of local banner names in 35 states and the District of Columbia. Of these stores, 2,255 have pharmacies and 1,445 have fuel centers. We also offer ClickList and Harris Teeter ExpressLane personalized, order online, pick up at the store services at 637 of our supermarkets, and operate 784 convenience stores, either directly or through franchisees, 319 fine jewelry stores and an online retailer. We operate 38 food production plants, primarily bakeries and dairies, which supply approximately 35% of the corporate brand units sold in our supermarkets; the remaining corporate brand items are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers. This percentage has declined recently due to an expanded portfolio of non-grocery corporate brand units produced by outside manufacturers. Our food production plants produced 45% of our grocery category corporate brand units sold in our supermarkets, which is consistent with our historical trend. Our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores, fuel centers and via our online platforms. We earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers. Such costs include procurement and distribution costs, facility occupancy and operational costs, and overhead expenses. Our retail operations, which represent over 98% of our consolidated sales and EBITDA, is our only reportable segment. On September 2, 2016, we closed our merger with Modern HC Holdings, Inc. ( ModernHEALTH ) by purchasing 100% of the outstanding shares of ModernHEALTH for $407 million. ModernHEALTH is included in our ending Consolidated Balance Sheet for 2016 and in our Consolidated Statements of Operations from September 2, 2016 through January 28, 2017. On December 18, 2015, we closed our merger with Roundy s, Inc. ( Roundy ) by purchasing 100% of Roundy outstanding common stock for $3.60 per share and assuming Roundy outstanding debt, for a purchase price of $866 million. Roundy is included in our ending Consolidated Balance Sheets for 2015 and 2016 and in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the last six weeks of 2015 and all periods in 2016. On August 18, 2014, we closed our merger with Vitacost.com by purchasing 100% of the Vitacost.com outstanding common stock for $8.00 per share or $287 million. Vitacost.com is included in our ending Consolidated Balance Sheets for 2015 and 2016 and in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods succeeding the merger. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our mergers with ModernHEALTH, Roundy and Vitacost.com. 13 USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, including the related notes, set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). We provide non-GAAP measures, including First-In, First-Out ( FIFO ) gross margin, FIFO operating profit, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share because management believes these metrics are useful to investors and analysts. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin, operating profit, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share or any other GAAP measure of performance. These measures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Our calculation and reasons these are useful metrics to investors and analysts are explained below. We calculate FIFO gross margin as sales less merchandise costs, including advertising, warehousing, and transportation expenses, but excluding the Last-In, First-Out ( LIFO ) charge. Merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses. FIFO gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness. Management believes FIFO gross margin is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our day-to-day merchandising and operational effectiveness. We calculate FIFO operating profit as operating profit excluding the LIFO charge. FIFO operating profit is an important measure used by management to evaluate operational effectiveness. Management believes FIFO operating profit is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our day-to-day operational effectiveness. We believe the adjusted net earnings per diluted share metric presents more accurate year-over-year comparisons for our net earnings per diluted share because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations. OVERVIEW Notable items for 2016 are: Net earnings per diluted share of $2.05. Net earnings for 2016 includes $111 million ($71 million after-tax) of charges to operating, general and administrative expenses related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates future benefits ( 2016 Adjusted Items ). Adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $2.12. Identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.0%. Increased market share, total unit growth, added 420 Clicklist locations and achieved record high unit share for Corporate Brands. Results include unfavorable pricing and cost effects and the loss of sales leverage due to a challenging, deflationary operating environment. During 2016, we returned $2.2 billion to shareholders from share repurchases and dividend payments and invested $407 million in the ModernHEALTH merger. 14 The following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. to adjusted net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. and a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per diluted common share to adjusted net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per diluted common share, excluding the 2016 and 2014 Adjusted Items. In 2015, we did not have any adjustment items that affect net earnings or net earnings per diluted share. Net Earnings per Diluted Share excluding the Adjusted Items ($ in millions, except per share amounts) 2016 2015 2014 Net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. $ 1,975 $ 2,039 $ 1,728 2016 Adjusted Items (1)(2) 71 2014 Adjusted Items (1)(2) 39 Net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. excluding the adjusted items above $ 2,046 $ 2,039 $ 1,767 Net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per diluted common share $ 2.05 $ 2.06 $ 1.72 2016 Adjusted Items (3) 0.07 2014 Adjusted Items (3) 0.04 Net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per diluted common share excluding the adjusted items above $ 2.12 $ 2.06 $ 1.76 Average numbers of common shares used in diluted calculation 958 980 993 (1) The amounts presented represent the after-tax effect of the 2016 and 2014 Adjusted Items. The 2014 Adjusted Items are an $87 million ($56 million after-tax) charge to OG&A due to the commitments and withdrawal liabilities arising from restructuring of certain multi-employer obligations ( 2014 Multi-Employer Pension Plan Obligation ) to help stabilize associates future pension benefits, offset partially by the benefits from certain tax items of $17 million. (2) The pre-tax adjustments for the 2016 and 2014 Adjusted Items were $111 million and $87 million, respectively. (3) The amounts presented represent the net earnings per diluted common share effect of the 2016 and 2014 Adjusted Items. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Sales Total Sales ($ in millions) Percentage Percentage 2016 Increase(2) 2015 Increase(3) 2014 Total supermarket sales without fuel $ 96,900 6.1 % $ 91,310 5.8 % $ 86,281 Fuel sales 13,979 (5.6) % 14,804 (21.5) % 18,850 Other sales(1) 4,458 20.0 % 3,716 11.5 % 3,334 Total sales $ 115,337 5.0 % $ 109,830 1.3 % $ 108,465 (1) Ot her sales primarily relate to sales at convenience stores, excluding fuel; jewelry stores; food production plants to outside customers; data analytic services; variable interest entities; specialty pharmacy; in-store health clinics; digital coupon services; and online sales by Vitacost.com. (2) This column represents the sales percentage increases in 2016, compared to 2015. (3) This column represents the sales percentage increases in 2015, compared to 2014. 15 Total sales increased in 2016, compared to 2015, by 5.0%. This increase was primarily due to our increase in total supermarket sales, without fuel, and our merger with ModernHEALTH, partially offset by a decrease in fuel sales due to a 9.4% decrease in the average retail fuel price. The increase in total supermarket sales without fuel for 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily due to our merger with Roundy s, an increase in supermarket square footage and our identical supermarket sales increase, excluding fuel, of 1.0%. Identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, for 2016, compared to 2015, increased primarily due to an increase in the number of households shopping with us, partially offset by product cost deflation of 0.8%. Excluding mergers, acquisitions and operational closings, total supermarket square footage at the end of 2016 increased 3.4% over 2015. Total fuel sales decreased 5.6% in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to a decrease in the average retail fuel price of 9.4%, partially offset by an increase in fuel gallons sold of 4.2%. The decrease in the average retail fuel price was caused by a decrease in the product cost of fuel. Total sales increased in 2015, compared to 2014, by 1.3%. This increase in 2015 total sales, compared to 2014, was primarily due to an increase in identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, of 5.0%. Total sales also increased due to the inclusion of Roundy sales, due to our merger, for the period of December 18, 2015 to January 30, 2016. Identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, for 2015, compared to 2014, increased primarily due to an increase in the number of households shopping with us, an increase in visits per household, changes in product mix and product cost inflation. Total fuel sales decreased in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to a 26.7% decrease in the average retail fuel price, partially offset by an increase in fuel gallons sold of 7.1%. We define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters. Although identical supermarket sales is a relatively standard term, numerous methods exist for calculating identical supermarket sales growth. As a result, the method used by our management to calculate identical supermarket sales may differ from methods other companies use to calculate identical supermarket sales. We urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate identical supermarket sales before comparing our identical supermarket sales to those of other such companies. Fuel discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in-store purchases are included in all of the identical supermarket sales results calculations as illustrated in the following table and reduce our identical supermarket sales results. Differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage. Identical supermarket sales include sales from all departments at identical multi-department stores and Roundy stores that are identical as if they were part of the Company in the prior year. Our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the following table. We used the identical supermarket dollar figures presented below to calculate percentage changes for 2016 and 2015. Identical Supermarket Sales (dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Including supermarket fuel centers $ 103,180 $ 103,106 Excluding supermarket fuel centers $ 92,451 $ 91,568 Including supermarket fuel centers 0.1 % 1.1 % Excluding supermarket fuel centers 1.0 % 5.0 % Gross Margin, LIFO and FIFO Gross Margin Our gross margin rates, as a percentage of sales, were 22.40% in 2016, 22.16% in 2015 and 21.16% in 2014. The increase in 2016, compared to 2015, resulted primarily from lower fuel sales, a lower LIFO charge and our merger with Roundy due to its historically higher gross margin rate, partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers, unfavorable pricing and cost effects due to transitioning to a deflationary operating environment, our merger with ModernHEALTH due to its historically lower gross margin rate and increased warehousing and shrink costs, as a percentage of sales. The increase in 2015, compared to 2014, resulted primarily from lower fuel sales, reductions in transportation costs and a lower LIFO charge, partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink costs, as a percentage of sales. Lower fuel sales increase our gross margin rate, as a percentage of sales, due to the very low gross margin rate, as a percentage of sales, on fuel sales compared to non-fuel sales. 16 Our LIFO charge was $19 million in 2016, $28 million in 2015 and $147 million in 2014. In 2016, our LIFO charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to pharmacy, and was partially offset by annualized product cost deflation in other departments. In 2015, we experienced lower product cost inflation, compared to 2014, which resulted in a lower LIFO charge. In 2015, our LIFO charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to pharmacy, and was partially offset by annualized product cost deflation related to meat and dairy. In 2014, our LIFO charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to pharmacy, grocery, deli, meat and seafood. Our FIFO gross margin rates, as a percentage of sales, were 22.42% in 2016, 22.18% in 2015 and 21.30% in 2014. Excluding the effect of fuel and our mergers with Roundy and ModernHEALTH ( recent mergers ), our FIFO gross margin rate decreased seven basis points in 2016, compared to 2015. This decrease resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers, unfavorable pricing and cost effects due to transitioning to a deflationary operating environment and increased warehousing and shrink costs, as a percentage of sales. Excluding the effect of fuel, our FIFO gross margin rate decreased four basis points in 2015, compared to 2014. This decrease resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink costs, partially offset by a reduction in transportation costs, as a percentage of sales. Operating, General and Administrative Expenses OG&A expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs such as wages, health care benefits and retirement plan costs, utility and credit card fees. Rent expense, depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in OG&A. OG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 16.63% in 2016, 16.34% in 2015 and 15.82% in 2014. OG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 29 basis points to 16.63% in 2016 from 16.34% in 2015. This increase resulted primarily from a decrease in fuel sales, the loss of sales leverage due to transitioning to a deflationary operating environment, the 2016 Adjusted Items, our recent mergers due to their historically higher OG&A rate, compared to our other divisions, and increases in healthcare benefit and credit card costs, partially offset by increased supermarket sales, productivity improvements, effective cost controls, $110 million United Food and Commercial Workers International Union ( UFCW ) contributions made during 2015 ( 2015 UFCW Contributions ) and decreases in incentive plans, company-sponsored pension plans and utility costs, as a percentage of sales. Our fuel sales lower our OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales, due to the very low OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales, of fuel sales compared to non-fuel sales. Excluding the effect of fuel, the 2016 Adjusted Items, recent mergers and the 2015 UFCW Contributions, our OG&A rate decreased five basis points in 2016, compared to 2015. This decrease resulted primarily from increased supermarket sales, productivity improvements, effective cost controls and decreases in incentive plans, company-sponsored pension plans and utility costs, partially offset by the loss of sales leverage due to transitioning to a deflationary operating environment and increases in healthcare benefit and credit card costs, as a percentage of sales. OG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 52 basis points to 16.34% in 2015 from 15.82% in 2014. This increase resulted primarily from a decrease in fuel sales, increases in EMV chargebacks, company-sponsored pension, healthcare and incentive plan costs, partially offset by increased supermarket sales, the 2014 Multi-Employer Pension Plan Obligation, lower charges for total contributions to The Kroger Foundation and UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan ( 2014 Contributions ), compared to the 2015 UFCW Contributions, productivity improvements and effective cost controls at the store level. Excluding fuel, the 2015 UFCW Contributions, the 2014 Contributions and the 2014 Multi-Employer Pension Plan Obligation, our OG&A rate decreased nine basis points, compared to 2014. The decrease resulted primarily from increased supermarket sales, productivity improvements and effective cost controls at the store level, partially offset by increases in EMV chargebacks , company-sponsored pension, healthcare and incentive plan costs, as a percentage of sales. Rent Expense Rent expense increased on a total dollars and percentage of sales basis in 2016, compared to 2015, due to: Our merger with Roundy s, due to its higher volume of leased versus owned supermarkets, and Lower fuel sales, which increases our rent expense rate, as a percentage of sales. 17 Rent expense increased in 2015, compared to 2014, due to our merger with Roundy , partially offset by our continued emphasis to own rather than lease, whenever possible. Rent expense, as a percentage of sales, in 2015 was consistent with 2014, due to the effect of our merger with Roundy being offset by our continued emphasis to own rather than lease, whenever possible, and the benefit of increased sales. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense increased on a total dollars and percentage of sales basis in 2016, compared to 2015, due to: Additional depreciation on capital investments, excluding mergers and lease buyouts, of $3.6 billion, during 2016, Unfavorable sales leveraging from transitioning to a deflationary operating environment, and Our merger with Roundy s. Depreciation and amortization expense increased on a total dollars and percentage of sales basis in 2015, compared to 2014, due to: Ad ditional depreciation on capital investments, excluding mergers and lease buyouts of $3.3 billion, during 2015 , and Our merger with Roundy s. Operating Profit and FIFO Operating Profit Operating profit was $3.4 billion in 2016, $3.6 billion in 2015 and $3.1 billion in 2014. Operating profit, as a percentage of sales, decreased 28 basis points in 2016, compared to 2015, due to increased OG&A, depreciation and amortization and rent expenses, partially offset by higher gross margin and a lower LIFO charge, as a percentage of sales. Operating profit, as a percentage of sales, increased 37 basis points in 2015, compared to 2014, due to higher gross margin and a lower LIFO charge, partially offset by increased OG&A, depreciation and amortization and rent expenses, as a percentage of sales. Specific factors of these operating trends are discussed earlier in this section. FIFO operating profit was $3.5 billion in 2016, $3.6 billion in 2015 and $3.3 billion in 2014. FIFO operating profit, as a percentage of sales, was 3.00% in 2016, 3.28% in 2015 and 3.03% in 2014. Fuel sales lower our operating profit rate due to the very low operating profit rate, as a percentage of sales, of fuel sales compared to non-fuel sales. FIFO operating profit, as a percentage of sales excluding fuel, the 2016 Adjusted Items, the effects of our recent mergers and the 2015 UFCW Contributions, decreased 14 basis points in 2016, compared to 2015. This decrease was due to lower gross margin, higher depreciation and amortization, partially offset by decreased OG&A and rent expenses, as a percentage of sales. FIFO operating profit, as a percentage of sales excluding fuel, the effects of our Roundy merger, the 2015 UFCW Contributions, the 2014 Contributions and the 2014 Multi-Employer Pension Plan Obligation, increased 8 basis points in 2015, compared to 2014. This increase was primarily due to decreased OG&A and rent, partially offset by lower gross margin and increased depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of sales. Specific factors of these operating trends are discussed earlier in this section. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $522 million in 2016, $482 million in 2015 and $488 million in 2014. The increase in interest expense in 2016, compared to 2015, resulted primarily from additional borrowings used for share repurchases, mergers and a higher weighted average interest rate. The decrease in interest expense in 2015, compared to 2014, resulted primarily from the timing of debt principal payments and debt issuances, partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with our commercial paper program. 18 Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 32.8% in 2016, 33.8% in 2015 and 34.1% in 2014. The 2016 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the recognition of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments after the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the utilization of tax credits, the Domestic Manufacturing Deduction and other changes, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes. The 2015 and 2014 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the utilization of tax credits, the Domestic Manufacturing Deduction and other changes, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes. Net Earnings and Net Earnings Per Diluted Share Our net earnings are based on the factors discussed in the Results of Operations section. Net earnings of $2.05 per diluted share in 2016 represented a decrease of 0.5% from net earnings of $2.06 per diluted share in 2015. Excluding the 2016 Adjusted Items, net earnings of $2.12 per diluted share in 2016 represented an increase of 2.9% from net earnings of $2.06 per diluted share in 2015. The net earnings of 2015 do not include any adjusted items. The 2.9% increase resulted primarily from a lower LIFO charge, lower income tax expense and lower weighted average common shares outstanding due to common share repurchases, partially offset by lower non-fuel FIFO operating profit and lower fuel earnings. Net earnings of $2.06 per diluted share in 2015 represented a increase of 19.8% from net earnings of $1.72 per diluted share in 2014. Excluding the 2014 Adjusted Items, net earnings of $2.06 per diluted share in 2015 represented an increase of 17.0% from net earnings of $1.76 per diluted share in 2014. The net earnings of 2015 do not include any adjusted items. The 17.0% increase resulted primarily from higher non-fuel FIFO operating profit, a lower LIFO charge and lower weighted average common shares outstanding due to common share repurchases, partially offset by lower fuel earnings and higher income tax expense. COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS We maintain share repurchase programs that comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares, from time to time. We made open market purchases of our common shares totaling $1.7 billion in 2016, $500 million in 2015 and $1.1 billion in 2014 under these repurchase programs. In addition to these repurchase programs, we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans. This program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises, and the tax benefit from these exercises. We repurchased approximately $105 million in 2016, $203 million in 2015 and $155 million in 2014 of our common shares under the stock option program. The following Board of Director authorizations created repurchase programs to reacquire shares via open market purchases: A $500 million share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors and announced on June 25, 2015. On March 10, 2016, our Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase authority to supplement the June 2015 program. These programs were exhausted during the first quarter of 2016. On June 22, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $500 million share repurchase program. On September 15, 2016, our Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase authority to supplement the June 2016 program. The June 2016 program was exhausted during the fourth quarter of 2016. On March 9, 2017, our Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase authority to supplement the September 2016 program. During the first quarter through March 28, 2017, the Company used an additional $341 million of cash to repurchase 11 million common shares at an average price of $31.09 per share. As of March 28, 2017, we have exhausted the September 2016 program and have $498 million remaining under the March 2017 program. 19 CAPITAL INVESTMENTS Capital investments, including changes in construction-in-progress payables and excluding mergers and the purchase of leased facilities, totaled $3.7 billion in 2016, $3.3 billion in 2015 and $2.7 billion in 2014. Capital investments for mergers totaled $401 million in 2016, $168 million in 2015 and $252 million in 2014. We merged with ModernHEALTH in 2016, Roundy in 2015 and Vitacost.com in 2014. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these mergers. Capital investments for the purchase of leased facilities totaled $5 million in 2016, $35 million in 2015 and $135 million in 2014. The table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total supermarket square footage: Supermarket Storing Activity 2016 2015 2014 Beginning of year 2,778 2,625 2,640 Opened 50 31 33 Opened (relocation) 21 12 13 Acquired 159 Closed (operational) (32) (37) (48) Closed (relocation) (21) (12) (13) End of year 2,796 2,778 2,625 Total supermarket square footage (in millions) 178 173 162 RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL We calculate return on invested capital ( ROIC ) by dividing adjusted operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital. Adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit, and adding back our LIFO charge, depreciation and amortization and rent to our U.S. GAAP operating profit of the prior four quarters. Average invested capital is calculated as the sum of (i) the average of our total assets, (ii) the average LIFO reserve, (iii) the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and (iv) a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight; minus (i) the average taxes receivable, (ii) the average trade accounts payable, (iii) the average accrued salaries and wages and (iv) the average other current liabilities, excluding accrued income taxes. Averages are calculated for ROIC by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter, of the last four quarters, and dividing by two. We use a factor of eight for our total rent as we believe this is a common factor used by our investors, analysts and rating agencies. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. ROIC should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. ROIC is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital. Management believes ROIC is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets. Although ROIC is a relatively standard financial term, numerous methods exist for calculating a company ROIC. As a result, the method used by our management to calculate ROIC may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC. We urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROIC before comparing our ROIC to that of such other companies. 20 The following table provides a calculation of ROIC for 2016 and 2015. The January 30, 2016 calculation of ROIC excludes the financial position and results for the Roundy's merger. Rolling Four Quarters Ended ($ in millions) January 28, 2017 January 30, 2016 Return on Invested Capital Numerator Operating profit $ 3,436 $ 3,576 LIFO (credit) charge 19 28 Depreciation and amortization 2,340 2,089 Rent 881 723 Adjustments for pension plan agreements 111 Other (13) Adjusted operating profit $ 6,787 $ 6,403 Denominator Average total assets $ 35,201 $ 32,197 Average taxes receivable (1) (262) (206) Average LIFO reserve 1,283 1,259 Average accumulated depreciation and amortization 18,940 17,441 Average trade accounts payable (5,773) (5,390) Average accrued salaries and wages (1,330) (1,359) Average other current liabilities (2) (3,265) (3,054) Adjustment for Roundy merger (714) Rent x 8 7,048 5,784 Average invested capital $ 51,842 $ 45,958 Return on Invested Capital 13.09 % 13.93 % (1) Taxes receivable were $132 as of January 28, 2017, $392 as of January 30, 2016 and $20 as of January 31, 2015. The January 30, 2016 balance is higher than the other comparative balances due to changes to tangible property regulations in 2015. Refer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. (2) Other current liabilities included accrued income taxes of $1 as of January 28, 2017 and $5 as of January 31, 2015. We did not have any accrued income taxes as of January 30, 2016. Accrued income taxes are removed from other current liabilities in the calculation of average invested capital. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 21 Self-Insurance Costs We primarily are self-insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims. The liabilities represent our best estimate, using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods, of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through January 28, 2017. We establish case reserves for reported claims using case-basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known. For both workers compensation and general liability claims, we have purchased stop-loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis. We are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits. We account for the liabilities for workers compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate. A 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately $2 million. General liability claims are not discounted. The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs. Our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities. Impairments of Long-Lived Assets We monitor the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred. These events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset. When a triggering event occurs, we perform an impairment calculation, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows, utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores, to the carrying value for those stores. If we identify impairment for long-lived assets to be held and used, we compare the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value. Fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows. We record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value. With respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal, we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. We recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value, reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal. We recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling $26 million in 2016, $46 million in 2015 and $37 million in 2014. We record costs to reduce the carrying value of long-lived assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as Operating, general and administrative expense. 22 The factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation, the economy and market competition. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing long-lived assets for impairment at a different level, could produce significantly different results. Goodwill Our goodwill totaled $3.0 billion as of January 28, 2017. We review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, and also upon the occurrence of triggering events. We perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities (collectively, reporting units ) that have goodwill balances. Fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings, or discounted projected future cash flows, and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment. We base projected future cash flows on management knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future. If we identify potential for impairment, we measure the fair value of a reporting unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. We recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value. The annual evaluation of goodwill performed for our reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2016, 2015 and 2014 did not result in impairment. Based on current and future expected cash flows, we believe goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely. A 10% reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance. For additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2016, 2015 and 2014 see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative estimates and assumptions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level, could produce significantly different results. The cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation, business valuations in the market, the economy, market competition and our ability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses. Store Closing Costs We provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining non-cancellable lease payments after the closing date, net of estimated subtenant income. We estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores. We usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores, which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years. Adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates. We make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known. We review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs is adjusted to earnings in the proper period. We estimate subtenant income, future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. The ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets, inflation rates and general economic conditions. We reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value. We account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property, equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of long-lived assets. We classify inventory write-downs in connection with store closings, if any, in Merchandise costs. We expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred. 23 Post-Retirement Benefit Plans We account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of GAAP, which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We record, as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ), actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized. The determination of our obligation and expense for Company-sponsored pension plans and other post-retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts. Those assumptions are described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, mortality and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions, including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets, may materially affect our pension and other post-retirement obligations and our future expense. Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements also discusses the effect of a 1% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post-retirement benefit costs and the related liability. The objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. In making this determination, we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans. Our methodology for selecting the discount rates was to match the plan cash flows to that of a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the plan projected benefit cash flows. The discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows. The selection of the 4.25% and 4.18% discount rates as of year-end 2016 for pension and other benefits, respectively, represents the hypothetical bond portfolio using bonds with an AA or better rating constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant. We utilized a discount rate of 4.62% and 4.44% as of year-end 2015 for pension and other benefits, respectively. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of January 28, 2017, by approximately $510 million. To determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets held by Kroger for 2016, we considered current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories. In 2016, our assumed pension plan investment return rate was 7.40% compared to 7.44% in 2015 and 2014. During 2016, Kroger began managing the assets for the Harris Teeter and Roundy pension plans, and our expected rate of return reflects implementing a similar investment management strategy for the Harris Teeter and Roundy plans assets. Historically, the Kroger pension plans average rate of return was 5.81% for the 10 calendar years ended December 31, 2016, net of all investment management fees and expenses. The value of all investments in our Company-sponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending December 31, 2016, net of investment management fees and expenses, increased 6.90%. For the past 20 years, the Kroger pension plans average annual rate of return has been 7.77%. Based on the above information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations, we believe a 7.40% rate of return assumption is reasonable for 2016. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets. On January 31, 2015, we adopted new industry specific mortality tables based on mortality experience and assumptions for generational mortality improvement in determining our benefit obligations. On January 28, 2017, we adopted an updated assumption for generational mortality improvement, based on additional years of published mortality experience. 24 Sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of Kroger pension plan liabilities is illustrated below (in millions). Projected Benefit Percentage Obligation Expense Point Change Decrease/(Increase) Decrease/(Increase) Discount Rate +/- 1.0% $ 510/(620) $ 36/(46) Expected Return on Assets +/- 1.0% $ 32/(32) In 2016, we contributed $3 million to our Company-sponsored defined benefit plans and are not required to make any contributions to these plans in 2017. We contributed $5 million to our Company-sponsored defined benefit plans in 2015 and did not make contributions in 2014. Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of contributions. We contributed and expensed $215 million in 2016, $196 million in 2015 and $177 million in 2014 to employee 401(k) retirement savings accounts. The increase in 2016, compared to 2015, is primarily due to our recent mergers. The increase in 2015, compared to 2014, is due to a higher employee savings rate. The 401(k) retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the Company based on participant contributions, plan compensation and length of service. Multi-Employer Pension Plans We contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements. These multi-employer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. Trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions. The trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans. We recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or when commitments are probable and reasonably estimable, in accordance with GAAP. We made cash contributions to these plans of $289 million in 2016, $426 million in 2015 and $297 million in 2014. We continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to under-funded multi-employer pension plans as it relates to our associates who are beneficiaries of these plans. These under-fundings are not our liability. When an opportunity arises that is economically feasible and beneficial to us and our associates, we may negotiate the restructuring of under-funded multi-employer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates future benefits and become the fiduciary of the restructured multi-employer pension plan. The commitments from these restructurings do not change our debt profile as it relates to our credit rating. We are currently designated as the named fiduciary of the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan and have sole investment authority over these assets. Significant effects of these restructuring agreements recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements are: In 2016, we incurred a charge of $111 million, $71 million, after tax, due to commitments and withdrawal liabilities arising from the restructuring of certain multi-employer pension plan obligations, of which $28 million was contributed to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in 2016. In 2015, we contributed $190 million to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan. We had previously accrued $60 million of the total contributions at January 31, 2015 and recorded expense for the remaining $130 million at the time of payment in 2015. In 2014, we incurred a charge of $56 million. after-tax, related to commitments and withdrawal liabilities associated with the restructuring of pension plan agreements, of which $15 million was contributed to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in 2014. 25 As we continue to work to find solutions to under-funded multi-employer pension plans, it is possible we could incur withdrawal liabilities for certain funds. Two locations have initiated a withdrawal process, in the first quarter of 2017, resulting in an estimated withdrawal liability of less than $100 million, after-tax. Based on the most recent information available to us, we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of the multi-employer plans to which we contribute substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits. We have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets, (i.e., the amount of underfunding), as of December 31, 2016. Because we are only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans, we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of our contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing our share of the underfunding. Nonetheless, the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer. As of December 31, 2016, we estimate that our share of the underfunding of multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute, or as it relates to certain funds, an estimated withdrawal liability, was approximately $3.0 billion, pre-tax, or $1.8 billion, after-tax. This represents an increase in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately $100 million, pre-tax, or approximately $40 million, after-tax, as of December 31, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015. The increase in the amount of underfunding is attributable to lower than expected returns on the assets held in the multi-employer pension plans during 2016 and changes in mortality rate assumptions. Our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data (that include the estimates of others), and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable. We have made and disclosed this estimate not because, except as noted above, this underfunding is a direct liability of ours. Rather, we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences. In 2017, we expect to contribute approximately $360 million to multi-employer pension plans, which excludes any additional multi-employer pension plan restructurings that could occur. Of this amount, $35 million has been accrued for as of January 28, 2017. We expect increases in expense as a result of increases in multi-employer pension plan contributions over the next few years. Finally, underfunding means that, in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans, we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability. Any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with GAAP. The amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations, returns on the assets held in the multi-employer pension plans, benefit payments or future restructuring agreements. The amount could decline, and our future expense would be favorably affected, if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or favorable legislation. On the other hand, our share of the underfunding could increase and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline, if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or adverse legislation. We continue to evaluate our potential exposure to under-funded multi-employer pension plans. Although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of ours, any commitments to fund certain multi-employer pension plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information relating to our participation in these multi-employer pension plans. Uncertain Tax Positions We review the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other disclosures related to uncertain tax positions. Various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions, including state and local taxes, we record allowances for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which an allowance has been established, is audited and fully resolved. As of January 28, 2017, the Internal Revenue Service had concluded its examination of our 2012 and 2013 federal tax returns. The assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. 26 Share-Based Compensation Expense We account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of GAAP. Under this method, we recognize compensation expense for all share-based payments granted. We recognize share-based compensation expense, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, over the requisite service period of the award. In addition, we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award, over the period the award restrictions lapse. As described in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we adopted a new share-based compensation standard during 2016, which requires recognition of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments in our provision for income taxes. Excess tax benefits were historically recorded in additional paid-in capital. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally on a LIFO basis) or market. In total, approximately 89% and 95% of inventories were valued using the LIFO method in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cost for the balance of the inventories, including substantially all fuel inventories, was determined using the FIFO method. Replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by $1.3 billion at January 28, 2017 and January 31, 2016. We follow the Link-Chain, Dollar-Value LIFO method for purposes of calculating our LIFO charge or credit. We follow the item-cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the LIFO adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions. This method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances and cash discounts) of each item and recording the cost of items sold. The item-cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory. In addition, substantially all of our inventory consists of finished goods and is recorded at actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances and cash discounts). We evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities. We record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date. Vendor Allowances We recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold. In most cases, vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item, and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item. When it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item, we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold. We recognized approximately $7.8 billion in 2016, $7.3 billion in 2015 and $6.9 billion in 2014 of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs. We recognized approximately 92% of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. This amendment eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. This amendment became effective for us beginning January 31, 2016, and was adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard. The adoption of this amendment did not have an effect on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the second quarter of 2016, we adopted ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This amendment addresses several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. As a result of the adoption, we recognized $49 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments in our provision for income taxes in 2016. These items were historically recorded in additional paid-in capital. In addition, for 2016, cash flows related to excess tax benefits are classified as an operating activity. Cash paid on employees behalf related to shares withheld for tax 27 purposes is classified as a financing activity. Retrospective application of the cash flow presentation requirements resulted in increases to both Net cash provided by operating activities and Net cash used by financing activities of $59 million for 2016, $84 million for 2015 and $52 for 2014. Our stock compensation expense continues to reflect estimated forfeitures. During 2016, we adopted ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Topic 205) . This standard requires us to evaluate, for each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the Consolidated Financial Statements are issued or are available to be issued. If substantial doubt is raised, additional disclosures around our plan to alleviate these doubts are required. The adoption of this standard did not affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement - Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) (Topic 820) . This standard requires us to disclose which assets we value using net asset value as a practical expedient, and ends the requirement to classify these assets within the GAAP fair value hierarchy. See Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures of assets we value using net asset value as a practical expedient. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended by several subsequent ASUs, which provides guidance for revenue recognition. The standard core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Per ASU 2015-14, Deferral of Effective Date, this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending February 2, 2019. Early adoption is permitted as of the first quarter of our fiscal year ending February 3, 2018. We are currently in the process of evaluating the effect of adoption of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This amendment requires deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance will be effective for our fiscal year ending February 3, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The implementation of this amendment will not have an effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and will not have a significant effect on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases , which provides guidance for the recognition of lease agreements. The standard core principle is that a company will now recognize most leases on its balance sheet as lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year ending February 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this ASU will result in a significant increase to our Consolidated Balance Sheets for lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, and we are currently evaluating the other effects of adoption of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe our current off-balance sheet leasing commitments are reflected in our investment grade debt rating. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Information Net cash provided by operating activities We generated $4.3 billion of cash from operations in 2016, compared to $4.9 billion in 2015 and $4.2 billion in 2014. The cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including non-controlling interests adjusted primarily for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization, stock compensation, expense for Company-sponsored pension plans and the LIFO charge. Changes in working capital created a net cash outflow in 2016, and net cash inflows for 2015 and 2014. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2016, compared to 2015, resulted primarily due to a decrease in net earnings including noncontrolling interests and changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in non-cash expenses, deferred taxes and lower payments on long-term liabilities. 28 The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015, compared to 2014, resulted primarily due to an increase in net earnings including non-controlling interests, an increase in non-cash items and changes in working capital. The increase in non-cash items in 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization expense and expense for Company-sponsored pension plans, partially offset by a lower LIFO charge. Cash provided (used) by operating activities for changes in working capital was ($492) million in 2016, compared to $180 million in 2015 and $3 million in 2014. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for changes in working capital in 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily due to the net effect of the following: Higher receivables due to increasing vendor allowance activity and pharmacy sales requiring third party payments, Increased inventory purchases due to store growth and new distribution centers, Higher prepayment of benefit costs, Lower accrued expenses due to reduced incentive plan payout accruals, and Lower tax payments due to a 2015 tax deduction associated with tangible property regulations. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for changes in working capital in 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by trade accounts payables and store deposits in transit, partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by income taxes receivable and payable. Net cash used by investing activities Cash used by investing activities was $3.9 billion in 2016, compared to $3.6 billion in 2015 and $3.1 billion in 2014. The amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to increased cash payments for capital investments and our merger with ModernHEALTH. The amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2015, compared to 2014, due to increased payments for capital investments, partially offset by lower payments for mergers. Net cash provided (used) by financing activities Financing activities used cash of $352 million in 2016, $1.3 billion in 2015 and $1.2 billion in 2014. The decrease in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases, partially offset by higher long-term and commercial paper borrowings. The increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily related to increased payments on long-term debt and commercial paper, partially offset by higher proceeds from issuances of long-term debt and decreased treasury stock purchases. Debt Management Total debt, including both the current and long-term portions of capital lease and lease-financing obligations, increased $2.0 billion to $14.1 billion as of year-end 2016, compared to 2015. The increase in 2016, compared to 2015, resulted from the issuance of (i) $1.0 billion of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 4.45%, (ii) 750 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 2.65%, (iii) $500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 3.875%, (iv) $500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 1.5%, (v) increases in commercial paper borrowings and (vi) increases in capital lease obligations due to additional leased locations, partially offset by payments of $1.4 billion on maturing long-term debt obligations. Total debt, including both the current and long-term portions of capital lease and lease-financing obligations, increased $481 million to $12.1 billion as of year-end 2015, compared to 2014. The increase in 2015, compared to 2014, resulted primarily from the issuance of (i) $300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 2.00%, (ii) $300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 2.60%, (iii) $500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 3.50% and (iv) an increase in capital lease obligations due to our merger with Roundy and various leased locations, partially offset by payments of $678 million on long-term debt obligations assumed as part of our merger with Roundy and $500 million of payments at maturity of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 3.90%. The increase in financing obligations was due to partially funding our merger with Roundy s. 29 Liquidity Needs We estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelve-month period to range from $5.9 to $6.4 billion, which includes anticipated requirements for working capital, capital investments, interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper, offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of 2016. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and because we have consistent access to the capital markets. Based on current operating trends, we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility, will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months. We have approximately $1.4 billion of commercial paper and $600 million of senior notes maturing in the next twelve months, which is included in the range of $5.9 to $6.4 billion in estimated liquidity needs. We expect to refinance this debt, in 2017, by issuing additional senior notes or commercial paper on favorable terms based on our past experience. We also currently plan to continue repurchases of common shares under the Company share repurchase programs and a growing dividend. We believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions. Factors Affecting Liquidity We can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately $2.75 billion under our commercial paper program. At January 28, 2017, we had $1.4 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Commercial paper borrowings are backed by our credit facility, and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility. If our short-term credit ratings fall, the ability to borrow under our current commercial paper program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our commercial paper program. This could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility, under which we believe we have sufficient capacity. However, in the event of a ratings decline, we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program would be any lower than $500 million on a daily basis. Although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating, the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by an increase in our Leverage Ratio. As of March 22, 2017, we had $956 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Our credit facility requires the maintenance of a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (our financial covenants ). A failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility. These financial covenants are described below: Our Leverage Ratio (the ratio of Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility) was 2.27 to 1 as of January 28, 2017. If this ratio were to exceed 3.50 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired. In addition, our applicable margin on borrowings is determined by our Leverage Ratio. Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA plus Consolidated Rental Expense to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense plus Consolidated Rental Expense, as defined in the credit facility) was 4.75 to 1 as of January 28, 2017. If this ratio fell below 1.70 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired. Our credit facility is more fully described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We were in compliance with our financial covenants at year-end 2016. 30 The tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments, based on year of maturity or settlement, as of January 28, 2017 (in millions of dollars): 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations (1) (2) Long-term debt(3) $ 2,197 $ 1,315 $ 1,246 $ 724 $ 797 $ 7,036 $ 13,315 Interest on long-term debt (4) 444 479 422 343 330 3,995 6,013 Capital lease obligations 92 76 71 66 64 647 1,016 Operating lease obligations 986 932 856 759 656 3,992 8,181 Financed lease obligations 7 8 8 9 9 53 94 Self-insurance liability (5) 229 146 100 68 41 98 682 Construction commitments(6) 428 428 Purchase obligations(7) 478 178 78 68 36 65 903 Total $ 4,861 $ 3,134 $ 2,781 $ 2,037 $ 1,933 $ 15,886 $ 30,632 Other Commercial Commitments Standby letters of credit $ 242 $ $ $ $ $ $ 242 Surety bonds 396 396 Total $ 638 $ $ $ $ $ $ 638 (1) The contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which totaled approximately $33 million in 2016. This table also excludes contributions under various multi-employer pension plans, which totaled $289 million in 2016. (2) The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined. (3) As of January 28, 2017 we had $1.4 billion of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit facility. (4) Amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of January 28, 2017, and stated fixed and swapped interest rates, if applicable, for all other debt instruments. (5) The amounts included in the contractual obligations table for self-insurance liability related to workers compensation claims have been stated on a present value basis. (6) Amounts include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction. These amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. (7) Amounts include commitments, many of which are short-term in nature, to be utilized in the normal course of business, such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our food production plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and food production plants. Our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties and outside service contracts. Any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 28, 2017, we maintained a $2.75 billion (with the ability to increase by $750 million), unsecured revolving credit facility that, unless extended, terminates on June 30, 2019. Outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper borrowings, and some outstanding letters of credit, reduce funds available under the credit facility. As of January 28, 2017, we had $1.4 billion of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit facility. The outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit facility totaled $13 million as of January 28, 2017. In addition to the available credit mentioned above, as of January 28, 2017, we had authorized for issuance $4 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC and effective on December 14, 2016. 31 We also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self-insured workers compensation claims. These bonds are required by most states in which we are self-insured for workers compensation and are placed with predominately third-party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our self-insured retention levels. These bonds do not represent liabilities of ours, as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs. Market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and, in some instances, availability of these bonds may become more limited, which could affect our costs of, or access to, such bonds. Although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds, if this does become an issue, we would issue letters of credit, in states where allowed, against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements. This could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility. We also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions. We could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations. Due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties, and various other remedies available to us, we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote. We have agreed to indemnify certain third-party logistics operators for certain expenses, including multi-employer pension plan obligations and withdrawal liabilities. In addition to the above, we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business. Such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to us; indemnities related to the sale of our securities; indemnities of directors, officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work; and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans. While our aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability, we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability. 32 OUTLOOK This discussion and analysis contains certain forward-looking statements about our future performance. These statements are based on management assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available to it. Such statements are indicated by words such as comfortable, committed, will, expect, goal, should, intend, target, believe, anticipate, plan, and similar words or phrases. These forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations, projections, beliefs, intentions or strategies are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. While we believe that the statements are accurate, uncertainties about the general economy, our labor relations, our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially. For 2017, we expect net earnings to be $2.21 to $2.25 per diluted share, including an estimated $0.09 for the 53 rd week. We expect the first quarter to be in the $0.55 to $0.59 range, the second quarter to be up slightly compared to last year, the third quarter to be up strongly compared to last year, and the fourth quarter to be up high single-digits compared to last year, without the benefit of the 53 rd week. We expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel sales, in 2017 to range from flat to 1.0% growth. We expect full-year FIFO operating margin in 2017, excluding fuel, to decline approximately 10 basis points compared to 2016 results. We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be $3.2 to $3.5 billion. These capital investments include approximately 55 major projects covering new stores, expansions and relocations; 175 major remodels; and other investments including digital, technology, minor remodels, and upgrades to logistics, merchandising systems and infrastructure to support our Customer 1 st business strategy. We expect total supermarket square footage for 2017 to grow approximately 1.8% before mergers, acquisitions and operational closings. We expect the 2017 effective tax rate to be approximately 35%, excluding the resolution of certain tax items. In 2017, we anticipate annualized product cost inflation, excluding fuel, and an annualized LIFO charge of approximately $25 million. We expect 2017 Company-sponsored pension plans expense to be approximately $110 million. We are not required to make a cash contribution in 2017. In 2017, we expect to contribute approximately $360 million to multi-employer pension funds. Of this amount, $35 million has been accrued for as of year-end. This excludes any additional multi-employer pension plan restructuring that could occur. We continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to under-funded multi-employer pension plans. Although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of Kroger, any new agreements that would commit us to fund certain multi-employer plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made. We are currently negotiating an agreement with UFCW for store associates in Atlanta. In 2017, we will also negotiate agreements with UFCW for store associates in Dallas and Food 4 Less Warehouse Stores. Negotiations this year will be challenging as we must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates needs for solid wages and good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits. 33 Various uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These include: The extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates. Our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit, including our bank credit facilities, could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us, or in the event that natural disasters or weather conditions interfere with the ability of our lenders to lend to us. Our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial markets. Our ability to achieve sales, earnings and cash flow goals may be affected by: labor negotiations or disputes; changes in the types and numbers of businesses that compete with us; pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors, including non-traditional competitors, and the aggressiveness of that competition; our response to these actions; the state of the economy, including interest rates, the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities, and the unemployment rate; the effect that fuel costs have on consumer spending; volatility of fuel margins; changes in government-funded benefit programs; manufacturing commodity costs; diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations; trends in consumer spending; the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing in response to economic conditions; the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery; changes in inflation or deflation in product and operating costs; stock repurchases; our ability to retain pharmacy sales from third party payors; consolidation in the healthcare industry, including pharmacy benefit managers; our ability to negotiate modifications to multi-employer pension plans; natural disasters or adverse weather conditions; the potential costs and risks associated with potential cyber-attacks or data security breaches; the success of our future growth plans; and the successful integration of Harris Teeter and Roundy s. Our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may also be affected by our ability to manage the factors identified above. Our ability to execute our financial strategy may be affected by our ability to generate cash flow. During the first three quarters of each fiscal year, our LIFO charge and the recognition of LIFO expense is affected primarily by estimated year-end changes in product costs. Our fiscal year LIFO charge is affected primarily by changes in product costs at year-end. If actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units, including variable interest entities, an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized. Our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws, the status of pending items with various taxing authorities, and the deductibility of certain expenses. Changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators. For example, we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base. Since fuel generates lower profit margins than our supermarket sales, we expect to see our FIFO gross margins decline as fuel sales increase. We cannot fully foresee the effects of changes in economic conditions on our business. We have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly in 2017. Other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking information. Accordingly, actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in, contemplated or implied by forward-looking statements made by us or our representatives. We undertake no obligation to update the forward-looking information contained in this filing. 34
