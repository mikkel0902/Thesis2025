ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes thereto included elsewhere herein. Our actual results of operations may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those included in Item 1A, Risk Factors and other portions of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless otherwise noted, all dollar amounts in tables are in millions and those relating to our results of operations are presented before taxes. OVERVIEW OUR COMPANY We operate three of the most recognized brands in the global vehicle rental and car sharing industry, Avis, Budget and Zipcar. We are a leading vehicle rental operator in North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and certain other regions we serve, with a rental fleet of more than 580,000 vehicles. We also license the use of our trademarks to licensees in the areas in which we do not operate directly. We and our licensees operate our brands in approximately 180 countries throughout the world. OUR SEGMENTS We categorize our operations into two reportable business segments: Americas and International, as discussed in Part I of this Form 10-K. BUSINESS AND TRENDS Our revenues are derived principally from vehicle rentals in our Company-owned operations and include: time and mileage ( T&M ) fees charged to our customers for vehicle rentals; payments from our customers with respect to certain operating expenses we incur, including gasoline and vehicle licensing fees, as well as concession fees, which we pay in exchange for the right to operate at airports and other locations; sales of loss damage waivers and insurance and rentals of navigation units and other items in conjunction with vehicle rentals; and royalty revenue from our licensees in conjunction with their vehicle rental transactions. Our operating results are subject to variability due to seasonality, macroeconomic conditions and other factors. Car rental volumes tend to be associated with the travel industry, particularly airline passenger volumes, or enplanements, which in turn tend to reflect general economic conditions. Our vehicle rental operations are also seasonal, with the third quarter of the year historically having been our strongest due to the increased level of leisure travel during such quarter. We have a partially variable cost structure and routinely adjust the size, and therefore the cost, of our rental fleet in response to fluctuations in demand. We believe that the following factors, among others, may affect our financial condition and results of operations: general travel demand, including worldwide enplanements; fleet, pricing, marketing and strategic decisions made by us and by our competitors; changes in fleet costs and in conditions in the used vehicle marketplace, as well as manufacturer recalls; changes in borrowing costs and in market willingness to purchase corporate and vehicle-related debt; demand for truck rentals and car sharing services; changes in the price of gasoline; and 40 Table of Contents changes in currency exchange rates. Throughout 2015, we operated in an uncertain and uneven economic environment marked by heightened geopolitical risks. We expect such economic conditions to continue in 2016. Nonetheless, we continue to anticipate that worldwide demand for vehicle rental and car sharing services will increase in 2016, most likely against a backdrop of modest and uneven global economic growth. Our access to new fleet vehicles has been adequate to meet our needs for both replacement of existing vehicles in the normal course and for growth to meet incremental demand, and we expect that to continue to be the case. We will look to pursue opportunities for pricing increases in 2016 to enhance our returns on invested capital and profitability. Our objective continues to be to focus on strategically accelerating our growth, strengthening our global position as a leading provider of vehicle rental services, continuing to enhance our customers rental experience, and controlling costs and driving efficiency throughout the organization. We operate in a highly competitive industry and we expect to continue to face challenges and risks. We seek to mitigate our exposure to risks in numerous ways, including delivering upon our core strategic initiatives and through continued optimization of fleet levels to match changes in demand for vehicle rentals, maintenance of liquidity to fund our fleet and our operations, appropriate investments in technology and adjustments in the size, nature and terms of our relationships with vehicle manufacturers. 2015 HIGHLIGHTS In 2015 , we achieved record transaction volumes and revenues and had the highest Adjusted EBITDA in our history: Our net revenues totaled $8.5 billion and grew 5% in constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3% to $903 million and grew 9% in constant currency, primarily as a result of higher rental volumes and lower costs per rental day. We repurchased $394 million of our common stock, reducing our shares outstanding by approximately 8.8 million shares, or 8%. In January, we acquired our Avis and Budget licensees in Norway, Sweden and Denmark ( Scandinavia ); in April, we acquired the remaining 50% ownership in our Avis and Budget licensee for Brazil ( Brazil ); and in November, we acquired our Avis licensee in Poland ( Poland ). In April, we acquired Maggiore Group ( Maggiore ), the fourth-largest vehicle rental company in Italy. We issued $375 million of 5 % Senior Notes due 2025, the proceeds of which were used primarily to redeem all $223 million of our outstanding 9 % Senior Notes due 2020 and to finance a portion of our acquisition of Maggiore. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We measure performance principally using the following key operating statistics: (i) rental days, which represents the total number of days (or portion thereof) a vehicle was rented, and (ii) T&M revenue per rental day, which represents the average daily revenue we earned from rental and mileage fees charged to our customers, both of which exclude our U.S. truck rental and Zipcar car sharing operations. We also measure our ancillary revenues (rental-transaction revenue other than T&M revenue), such as from the sale of collision and loss damage waivers, insurance products, fuel service options and portable GPS navigation unit rentals. Our vehicle rental operating statistics (rental days and T&M revenue per rental day) are all calculated based on the actual rental of the vehicle during a 24-hour period. We believe that this methodology provides our management with the most relevant statistics in order to manage the business. Our calculation may not be comparable to other companies calculation of similarly-titled statistics. In addition, per-unit fleet costs exclude our U.S. truck rental operations. We assess performance and allocate resources based upon the separate financial information of our operating segments. In identifying our reportable segments, we also consider the nature of services provided by our operating segments, the geographical areas in which our segments operate and other relevant factors. Management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as income from continuing operations before non-vehicle related depreciation and amortization, any impairment charges, restructuring expense, early extinguishment of debt 41 Table of Contents costs, non-vehicle related interest, transaction-related costs and income taxes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful as a supplemental measure in evaluating the aggregate performance of our operating businesses and in comparing our results from period to period. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it allows investors to assess our financial condition and results of operations on the same basis that management uses internally. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other income statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. Year Ended December 31, 2015 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2014 Our consolidated results of operations comprised the following: Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Change % Change Revenues Vehicle rental $ 6,026 $ 6,026 $ 0 0 % Other 2,476 2,459 17 1 % Net revenues 8,502 8,485 17 0 % Expenses Operating 4,284 4,251 33 1 % Vehicle depreciation and lease charges, net 1,933 1,996 (63 ) (3 %) Selling, general and administrative 1,093 1,080 13 1 % Vehicle interest, net 289 282 7 2 % Non-vehicle related depreciation and amortization 218 180 38 21 % Interest expense related to corporate debt, net: Interest expense 194 209 (15 ) (7 %) Early extinguishment of debt 23 56 (33 ) (59 %) Transaction-related costs, net 68 13 55 * Restructuring expense 18 26 (8 ) (31 %) Total expenses 8,120 8,093 27 0 % Income before income taxes 382 392 (10 ) (3 %) Provision for income taxes 69 147 (78 ) (53 %) Net income $ 313 $ 245 $ 68 28 % __________ * Not meaningful. During 2015, our net revenues increased as a result of a 7% increase in total rental days (5% excluding Maggiore), largely offset by a $444 million (5%) negative impact from currency exchange rate movements and a 2% decrease in pricing in constant currency (1% excluding Maggiore). Total expenses increased as a result of increased volumes, a 7% increase in our car rental fleet (4% excluding Maggiore) and transaction-related costs, net, primarily associated with the acquisitions of Scandinavia and Brazil, most of which were non-cash expenses. This increase was largely offset by a favorable impact from currency exchange rate movements on expenses of approximately $418 million (5%). As a result of these items, and a $98 million income tax benefit related to the resolution of a prior-year tax matter, our net income increased by $68 million . Our effective tax rates were a provision of 18% and 38% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. For 2015, the Company reported earnings of $2.98 per diluted share, which includes after-tax transaction-related costs, net, of ($0.52) per share, after-tax debt extinguishment costs of ($0.13) per share, after-tax restructuring expense of ($0.12) per share and an income tax benefit related to resolution of prior-year tax matter of $0.93 per share. For 2014, the Company reported earnings of $2.22 per diluted share, which includes after-tax debt extinguishment costs of ($0.31) per share, after-tax restructuring expense of ($0.16) per share and after-tax transaction costs, net, of ($0.08) per share. 42 Table of Contents In the year ended December 31, 2015 : Operating expenses increased to 50.4% of revenue from 50.1% in the prior year. Vehicle depreciation and lease charges decreased to 22.7% of revenue from 23.5% in 2014, principally due to 10% lower per-unit fleet costs (5% in constant currency). Selling, general and administrative costs were 12.9% of revenue compared to 12.7% in 2014. Vehicle interest costs were 3.4% of revenue compared to 3.3% in the prior year. Following is a more detailed discussion of the results of each of our reportable segments: Revenues Adjusted EBITDA 2015 2014 % Change 2015 2014 % Change Americas $ 6,069 $ 5,961 2 % $ 682 $ 656 4 % International 2,433 2,524 (4 %) 277 280 (1 %) Corporate and Other (a) * (56 ) (60 ) * Total Company $ 8,502 $ 8,485 0 % 903 876 3 % Less: Non-vehicle related depreciation and amortization (b) 218 180 Interest expense related to corporate debt, net: Interest expense 194 209 Early extinguishment of debt 23 56 Transaction-related costs, net (c) 68 13 Restructuring expense 18 26 Income before income taxes $ 382 $ 392 __________ * Not meaningful.

Americas 2015 2014 % Change Revenue $ 6,069 $ 5,961 2 % Adjusted EBITDA 682 656 4 % Revenues increased 2% in 2015 compared with 2014 , primarily due to 4% growth in rental volumes, partially offset by a $59 million (1%) negative impact from currency exchange rate movements and a 1% decrease in pricing in constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4% in 2015 compared with 2014 , due to increased rental volumes and 4% lower per-unit fleet costs (3% in constant currency), partially offset by decreased pricing, higher maintenance, damage and insurance costs and a $7 million (1%) negative impact from currency exchange rate changes. In the year ended December 31, 2015 : Operating expenses were 49.3% of revenue compared to 49.1% in 2014. Vehicle depreciation and lease charges decreased to 24.3% of revenue from 25.0% in 2014 , principally due to lower per-unit fleet costs. Selling, general and administrative costs increased to 11.2% of revenue from 10.9% in the prior year. Vehicle interest costs, at 3.9% of revenue, remained level compared to the prior year. 43 Table of Contents International 2015 2014 % Change Revenue $ 2,433 $ 2,524 (4 %) Adjusted EBITDA 277 280 (1 %) Revenues decreased 4% during 2015 compared with 2014 , primarily due to a $385 million (15%) negative impact on revenues from currency exchange rate changes and a 4% decrease in pricing in constant currency (3% excluding Maggiore) and partially offset by an 18% increase in rental volumes (9% excluding Maggiore). Excluding Maggiore, total revenue per rental day decreased 1% in constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA declined 1% in 2015 compared with 2014 , due to lower pricing and a $42 million (15%) negative impact from currency exchange rate changes, partially offset by an increase in rental volumes, 23% lower per-unit fleet costs (9% in constant currency) and the acquisitions of Maggiore and Scandinavia. In the year ended December 31, 2015 : Operating expenses increased to 52.7% of revenue compared to 52.0% in 2014, primarily due to lower pricing and higher insurance costs, partially offset by increased rental volumes. Vehicle depreciation and lease charges decreased to 18.7% of revenue from 20.0% compared to the prior year, driven by lower per-unit fleet costs. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased to 14.9% of revenue compared to 15.0% in the prior year. Vehicle interest costs increased to 2.2% of revenue compared to 1.9% in the prior year.

During 2014, our net revenues increased principally as a result of a 5% increase in total rental days and a 1% increase in pricing, a 9% increase in ancillary revenues and $67 million of incremental revenue from Zipcar (acquired in March 2013), partially offset by a $43 million negative impact from currency exchange rate movements. Total expenses increased as a result of higher vehicle depreciation and lease charges resulting from a 5% increase in our car rental fleet and a 4% increase in our per-unit fleet costs. Total expenses also increased as a result of higher operating expenses due to increased volumes and higher selling, general and administrative costs driven by increased marketing expenses. These increases were partially offset by decreases in debt extinguishment costs, transaction-related costs, net, restructuring expense and impairment costs. As a result, despite a $16 million negative pretax impact from currency exchange rate movements, our net income increased by $229 million. Our effective tax rates were a provision of 38% and 84% in 2014 and 2013, respectively, principally due to the non-deductibility of the impairment charge and a portion of the early extinguishment of corporate debt costs in 2013. For 2014, the Company reported earnings of $2.22 per diluted share, which includes after-tax debt extinguishment costs of ($0.31) per share, after-tax restructuring expense of ($0.16) per share and after-tax transaction costs, net, of ($0.08) per share. For 2013, the Company reported earnings of $0.15 per diluted share, which includes after-tax debt extinguishment costs of ($0.94) per share, after-tax restructuring expense of ($0.35) per share, after-tax transaction costs, net, of ($0.35) per share and an after-tax impairment charge of ($0.28) per share. In the year ended December 31, 2014: Operating expenses decreased to 50.1% of revenue from 51.3% in 2013, driven by increased rental volumes and higher pricing. 45 Table of Contents Vehicle depreciation and lease charges increased to 23.5% of revenue from 22.8% in 2013, principally due to higher per-unit fleet costs. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased to 12.7% of revenue from 12.8% in 2013. Vehicle interest costs, at 3.3% of revenue, remained level compared to the prior year.

Adjusted EBITDA increased 17% in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to increased rental volumes and pricing as well as the acquisition of Zipcar, partially offset by 5% higher per-unit fleet costs. In the year ended December 31, 2014: Operating expenses were 49.1% of revenue, a decrease from 50.4% in the prior year, driven by increased rental volumes and higher pricing. Vehicle depreciation and lease charges increased to 25.0% of revenue from 24.0% in 2013, due to higher per-unit fleet costs and a decrease in fleet utilization as a result of increased manufacturer recalls. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased to 10.9% of revenue from 11.4% in the prior year, principally due to increased revenues. Vehicle interest costs, at 3.9% of revenue, remained level compared to the prior year. 46 Table of Contents International 2014 2013 % Change Revenue $ 2,524 $ 2,457 3 % Adjusted EBITDA 280 256 9 % Revenues increased 3% during 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to an 8% increase in ancillary revenues.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We present separately the financial data of our vehicle programs. These programs are distinct from our other activities as the assets under vehicle programs are generally funded through the issuance of debt that is collateralized by such assets. The income generated by these assets is used, in part, to repay the principal and interest associated with the debt. Cash inflows and outflows relating to the generation or acquisition of such assets and the principal debt repayment or financing of such assets are classified as activities of our vehicle programs. We believe it is appropriate to segregate the financial data of our vehicle programs because, ultimately, the source of repayment of such debt is the realization of such assets. FINANCIAL CONDITION As of December 31, 2015 2014 Change Total assets exclusive of assets under vehicle programs $ 5,918 $ 5,784 $ 134 Total liabilities exclusive of liabilities under vehicle programs 5,680 5,610 70 Assets under vehicle programs 11,716 11,058 658 Liabilities under vehicle programs 11,515 10,567 948 Stockholders equity 439 665 (226 ) 47 Table of Contents Total assets exclusive of assets under vehicle programs increased 2% and now include assets associated with the acquisitions of Maggiore, Scandinavia, Poland and Brazil (see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows ). Total liabilities exclusive of liabilities under vehicle programs increased by 1% (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt and Financing Arrangements regarding the changes in our corporate financings). Assets under vehicle programs and liabilities under vehicle programs increased primarily due to an increase in the size of our vehicle rental fleet to accommodate increased rental demand and associated funding, as well as our acquisitions. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt and Financing Arrangements for a detailed account of the change in our debt related to vehicle programs. The decrease in stockholders equity is primarily due to the repurchase of our common stock and currency translation adjustments, partially offset by our net income. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and our ability to generate cash through operations and financing activities, as well as available funding arrangements and committed credit facilities, each of which is discussed below. During 2015 , we issued $375 million of 5 % Senior Notes due 2025 and used proceeds from this borrowing to redeem the entire $223 million principal amount outstanding of our 9 % Senior Notes due 2020 and fund a portion of our acquisition of Maggiore. In addition, we repurchased approximately 8.8 million shares of our outstanding common stock with cash generated from our operations. During 2015 , we also had net borrowings under vehicle programs of $490 million to fund an increase in our assets under vehicle programs. Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, 2015 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2014 The following table summarizes our cash flows: Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Change Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,584 $ 2,579 $ 5 Investing activities (2,830 ) (2,807 ) (23 ) Financing activities 115 182 (67 ) Effects of exchange rate changes (41 ) (23 ) (18 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents (172 ) (69 ) (103 ) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 624 693 (69 ) Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 452 $ 624 $ (172 ) Cash provided by operating activities was substantially unchanged during 2015 compared with 2014 . Cash used in investing activities was substantially unchanged during 2015 compared with 2014 . The decrease in cash provided by financing activities in 2015 compared with 2014 is primarily due to an increase in our stock repurchases. We anticipate that our non-vehicle property and equipment additions will be approximately $210 million in 2016 . As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately $140 million of authorized share repurchase capacity and in January 2016, our Board of Directors increased the authorization by $300 million. We currently anticipate that we will utilize most of such capacity to repurchase common stock in 2016 . 48 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2014 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2013 The following table summarizes our cash flows: Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Change Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,579 $ 2,253 $ 326 Investing activities (2,807 ) (2,234 ) (573 ) Financing activities 182 76 106 Effects of exchange rate changes (23 ) (8 ) (15 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents (69 ) 87 (156 ) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 693 606 87 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 624 $ 693 $ (69 ) The increase in cash provided by operating activities during 2014 compared to 2013 is principally due to increased revenues and our continued cost reduction efforts. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2014 compared with 2013 is primarily due to increased vehicle purchases and our Budget Licensee Acquisitions during 2014, partially offset by the acquisition of Zipcar in 2013. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily reflects an increase in borrowings under vehicle programs to fund an increase in vehicle assets in 2014, partially offset by increased corporate borrowings to fund the purchase of Zipcar in 2013 and an increase in common stock repurchases in 2014. Debt and Financing Arrangements At December 31, 2015 , we had approximately $12.3 billion of indebtedness (including corporate indebtedness of approximately $3.5 billion and debt under vehicle programs of approximately $8.9 billion ). We use various hedging strategies, including derivative instruments, to manage a portion of the risks associated with our floating rate debt. Corporate indebtedness consisted of: As of December 31, Maturity Date 2015 2014 Change 4 % Senior Notes November 2017 $ 300 $ 300 $ Floating Rate Senior Notes (a) December 2017 249 248 1 Floating Rate Term Loan (b) March 2019 970 980 (10 ) 9 % Senior Notes March 2020 223 (223 ) 6% Euro-denominated Senior Notes (c) March 2021 502 561 (59 ) 5 % Senior Notes June 2022 400 400 5 % Senior Notes April 2023 674 674 5 % Senior Notes March 2025 375 375 Other (d) 46 34 12 Deferred financing fees (55 ) (67 ) 12 Total $ 3,461 $ 3,353 $ 108 __________ (a) The interest rate on these notes is equal to three-month LIBOR plus 275 basis points, for an aggregate rate of 3.16% at December 31, 2015; the Company has entered into an interest rate swap to hedge its interest rate exposure related to these notes at an aggregate rate of 3.58%. (b) The floating rate term loan is part of the Company senior revolving credit facility, which is secured by pledges of capital stock of certain subsidiaries of the Company, and liens on substantially all of the Company intellectual property and certain other real and personal property. As of December 31, 2015, the floating rate term loan due 2019 bears interest at 49 Table of Contents the greater of three-month LIBOR or 0.75%, plus 225 basis points, for an aggregate rate of 3.00%. The Company has entered into a swap to hedge $600 million of its interest rate exposure related to the floating rate term loan at an aggregate rate of 3.96%. (c) The reduction in the balance principally reflects currency translation adjustments. (d) Primarily includes capital leases which are secured by liens on the related assets. The following table summarizes the components of our debt under vehicle programs, including related party debt due to Avis Budget Rental Car Funding: As of December 31, 2015 2014 Change Americas Debt due to Avis Budget Rental Car Funding (a) $ 6,837 $ 6,340 $ 497 Americas Debt borrowings 643 746 (103 ) International Debt borrowings (a)(b) 1,187 685 502 International Capital leases 238 314 (76 ) Other 8 31 (23 ) Deferred financing fees (c) (53 ) (60 ) 7 Total $ 8,860 $ 8,056 $ 804 __________ (a) The increase reflects additional borrowings principally to fund increases in the Company's car rental fleet.

LIQUIDITY RISK Our primary liquidity needs include the payment of operating expenses, servicing of corporate and vehicle-related debt and procurement of rental vehicles to be used in our operations. The present intention of management is to reinvest the undistributed earnings of the Company foreign subsidiaries indefinitely into its foreign operations. We do not anticipate the need to repatriate foreign earnings to the United States to service corporate debt or for other U.S. needs. Our primary sources of funding are operating revenue, cash received upon the sale of vehicles, borrowings under our vehicle-backed borrowing arrangements and our senior revolving credit facility, and other financing activities. As discussed above, as of December 31, 2015 , we have cash and cash equivalents of $452 million , available borrowing capacity under our committed credit facilities of $1.1 billion , and available capacity under our vehicle programs of approximately $3.3 billion . In January 2016 and August 2015, the Company Board of Directors increased the Company share repurchase program authorization by $300 million and $250 million, respectively. Our liquidity position could be negatively affected by financial market disruptions or a downturn in the U.S. and worldwide economies, which may result in unfavorable conditions in the vehicle rental industry, in the asset-backed financing market, and in the credit markets, generally. We believe these factors have in the past affected and could in the future affect the debt ratings assigned to us by credit rating agencies and the cost of our borrowings. Additionally, a downturn in the worldwide economy or a disruption in the credit markets could impact our liquidity due to (i) decreased demand and pricing for vehicles in the used vehicle market, (ii) increased costs associated with, and/or reduced capacity or increased collateral needs under, our financings, (iii) the adverse impact of vehicle manufacturers, including Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, Peugeot, Volkswagen, Fiat, Kia, Toyota, Mercedes, Renault and Hyundai , being unable or unwilling to honor their obligations to repurchase or guarantee the depreciation on the related program vehicles and (iv) disruption in our ability to obtain financing due to negative credit events specific to us or affecting the overall debt market (see Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion). Our liquidity position could also be negatively impacted if we are unable to remain in compliance with the financial and other covenants associated with our senior revolving credit facility and other borrowings, including a maximum leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2015 , we were in compliance with the financial covenants governing our indebtedness. 51 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our principal future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 : 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Total Corporate debt $ 26 $ 564 $ 14 $ 948 $ 2 $ 1,962 $ 3,516 Debt under vehicle programs 1,501 2,884 1,626 1,389 1,513 8,913 Debt interest 404 328 242 171 126 206 1,477 Operating leases (a) 570 426 316 225 149 577 2,263 Commitments to purchase vehicles (b) 7,208 7,208 Defined benefit pension plan contributions (c) 10 10 Other purchase commitments (d) 88 41 24 4 3 160 Total (e) $ 9,807 $ 4,243 $ 2,222 $ 2,737 $ 1,793 $ 2,745 $ 23,547 __________ (a) Operating lease obligations are presented net of sublease rentals to be received (see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements) and include commitments to enter into operating leases. (b) Represents commitments to purchase vehicles, the majority of which are from Ford, General Motors and Chrysler. These commitments are generally subject to the vehicle manufacturers satisfying their obligations under the repurchase and guaranteed depreciation agreements. The purchase of such vehicles is generally financed through borrowings under vehicle programs in addition to cash received upon the sale of vehicles, many of which were purchased under repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs (see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). (c) Represents the expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2016. The amount of future contributions to our defined benefit pension plans will depend on the rates of return generated from plan assets and other factors (see Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements) and are not included above. (d) Primarily represents commitments under service contracts for information technology, telecommunications and marketing agreements with travel service companies. (e) Excludes income tax uncertainties of $37 million, $15 million of which is subject to indemnification by Realogy and Wyndham. We are unable to estimate the period in which these income tax uncertainties are expected to be settled. For more information regarding guarantees and indemnifications, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. ACCOUNTING POLICIES Critical Accounting Policies In presenting our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein. Several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events and/or events that are outside of our control. If there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions, it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time. Presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results. However, our businesses operate in environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed, and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective, nor complex. Goodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets. We have reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. In performing this review, we are required to make an assessment of fair value for our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. When determining fair value, we utilize various assumptions, including the fair market trading price of our common stock and management projections of future cash flows. A change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and, as such, could cause the fair value to be less than the respective carrying amount. In such event, we would then be required to record a charge, which would impact earnings. We review the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. 52 Table of Contents Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are allocated among our reporting units. During 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , there was no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. In the future, failure to achieve our business plans, a significant deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions of the countries in which we operate, or significant changes in the assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (such as the discount rate) could result in significantly different estimates of fair value that could trigger an impairment of the goodwill or intangible assets of our reporting units. Vehicles. We present vehicles at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record the initial cost of the vehicle, net of incentives and allowances from manufactures. We acquire our rental vehicles either through repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs with certain automobile manufacturers or outside of such programs. For rental vehicles purchased under such programs, we depreciate the vehicles such that the net book value on the date of sale or return to the manufacturers is intended to equal the contractual guaranteed residual values. For risk vehicles, acquired outside of manufacturer repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs, we depreciate based on the vehicles estimated residual market values and their expected dates of disposition. The estimation of residual values requires the Company to make assumptions regarding the age and mileage of the vehicle at the time of disposal, as well as expected used vehicle auction market conditions. The Company periodically evaluates estimated residual values and adjusts depreciation rates as appropriate. Differences between actual residual values and those estimated result in a gain or loss on disposal and are recorded as part of vehicle depreciation and lease charges, net, at the time of sale. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes. Currently we do not record valuation allowances on the majority of our tax loss carryforwards as there are adequate deferred tax liabilities that could be realized within the carryforward period. See Notes 2 and 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding income taxes. Public Liability, Property Damage and Other Insurance Liabilities. Insurance liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets include supplemental liability insurance, personal effects protection insurance, public liability, property damage and personal accident insurance claims for which we are self-insured. We estimate the required liability of such claims on an undiscounted basis utilizing an actuarial method that is based upon various assumptions which include, but are not limited to, our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors. The required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future based upon changes in claims experience, including changes in the number of incidents for which we are ultimately liable and changes in the cost per incident. Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements During 2015 , we adopted the following standards as a result of the issuance of new accounting pronouncements: Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity ; ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ; and ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . On January 1, 2016, we adopted the following standards as a result of the issuance of new accounting pronouncements: ASU 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments ; ASU 2015-05, Customer Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement ; and 53 Table of Contents ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity Ability to Continue as a Going Concern . Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which becomes effective on January 1, 2018. We have not completed our preliminary evaluation of the effect of this accounting pronouncement and cannot yet quantify the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have not yet selected a transition method by which we will adopt this standard. For detailed information regarding these pronouncements and the impact thereof on our business, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
