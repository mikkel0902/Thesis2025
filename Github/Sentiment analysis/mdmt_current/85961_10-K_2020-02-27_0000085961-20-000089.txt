ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following MD&A describes the principal factors affecting results of operations, financial resources, liquidity, contractual cash obligations and critical accounting estimates. The information presented in the MD&A is for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 unless otherwise noted. Amounts in 2019, 2018 and 2017 reflect the impact of the retrospective adoption in 2019 of the new accounting standard related to leasing. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the new leasing standard. OVERVIEW Ryder is a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions. Our operating segments are aggregated into reportable business segments based upon similar economic characteristics, products, services, customers and delivery methods. We report our financial performance based on three business segments: (1) FMS, which provides full service leasing and leasing with flexible maintenance options, commercial rental, and contract or transactional maintenance services of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.; (2) SCS, which provides integrated logistics solutions, including distribution, management, dedicated transportation and professional services in North America; and (3) DTS, which provides turnkey transportation solutions in the U.S. that includes dedicated vehicles, drivers and engineering, and administrative support. Dedicated transportation services provided as part of an operationally integrated, multi-service, supply chain solution to SCS customers are primarily reported in the SCS business segment. The FMS business, our largest segment, had total revenue and assets in 2019 of $5.6 billion and $13.0 billion , respectively, representing 56% of our consolidated revenue (excluding eliminations) and 90% of consolidated assets. SCS total revenue and assets in 2019 were $2.6 billion and $1.2 billion , respectively, representing 29% of our consolidated revenue and 9% of consolidated assets. DTS total revenue and assets in 2019 were $1.4 billion and $327 million , respectively, representing 15% of our consolidated revenue and 2% of consolidated assets. We operate in highly competitive markets. Our customers select us based on numerous factors including service quality, price, technology and service offerings. As an alternative to using our services, customers may choose to provide these services for themselves, or may choose to obtain similar services from other third-party vendors. Our customer base includes enterprises operating in a variety of industries including food and beverage service ( 22% ), transportation and logistics ( 21% ), automotive ( 11% ), retail and consumer goods ( 11% ), industrial ( 8% ), housing ( 8% ), technology ( 6% ), business and personal services ( 5% ) and other ( 8% ). In April 2018, we acquired MXD, an e-commerce fulfillment provider with a national network of facilities, including last mile delivery capabilities, which is included in our SCS business segment. Refer to Note 3 , " Acquisitions ," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Our results of operations and financial condition are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: used vehicle sales; market conditions including pricing and demand; customer contracting activity and retention; rental demand; maintenance costs; residual value estimates and other depreciation changes; currency exchange rate fluctuations; customer preferences; inflation; fuel and energy prices; general economic conditions; insurance costs; interest rates; labor costs; unemployment; tax rates; changes in accounting or regulatory requirements; and cybersecurity attacks. This MD&A includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this MD&A for information on these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure and the reasons why we believe each measure is useful to investors. In addition, this MD&A includes certain forward-looking statements regarding our 2020 outlook. These statements are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We caution readers that certain important factors could cause actual results and events to differ significantly from those expressed. For a detailed description of certain of these risk factors, please see Item 1A-Risk Factors and "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" sections of this Annual Report. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) The following discussion provides a summary of financial highlights that are discussed in more detail throughout our MD&A and within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: Change 2019 2018 2017 2019/2018 2018/2017 (In thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 8,925,801 $ 8,413,946 $ 7,280,074 6% 16% Operating revenue (1) 7,224,332 6,698,116 6,022,505 8 11 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (EBT) $ (42,271 ) $ 389,469 $ 296,436 NM 31% Comparable EBT (2) 56,089 418,862 348,257 (87) 20 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations (3) (23,272 ) 286,922 720,101 NM (60) Comparable earnings from continuing operations (2) 53,554 314,781 225,187 (83) 40 Net earnings (loss) (3) (24,410 ) 284,613 719,644 NM (60) Earnings (loss) per common share (EPS) Diluted Continuing operations (3) $ (0.45 ) $ 5.43 $ 13.54 NM (60)% Comparable (2) 1.01 5.95 4.23 (83) 41 Net earnings (loss) (3) (0.47 ) 5.38 13.53 NM (60) _________________ (1) Non-GAAP financial measure.

(2) Non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for a reconciliation of EBT, earnings (loss) from continuing operations and earnings (loss) from continuing operations per diluted common share to the comparable measures and the reasons why management believes these measures are important to investors. (3) 2017 amounts reflect a total tax provision benefit of $424 million , which includes the impact from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Refer to Note 12 , " Income Taxes ," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2019 , total revenue increased 6% to $8.9 billion and operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) increased 8% to $7.2 billion . Total revenue and operating revenue increased due to new business and higher volumes in all segments. Total and operating revenue growth also reflects the acquisition of MXD in the second quarter of 2018. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: 2019/2018 2018/2017 Total Operating Total Operating Organic, including price and volume 5% 8% 12% 10% Acquisitions 1 2 1 Fuel 2 Total increase 6% 8% 16% 11% EBT decreased to a loss of $(42) million in 2019 , reflecting higher depreciation expense related to changes in vehicle residual value estimates in our FMS segment in the third quarter of 2019 partially offset by improved operating results in DTS and SCS segments. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased 25% to $2.1 billion in 2019 compared with $1.7 billion in 2018 , reflecting higher cash earnings as well as lower working capital needs in 2019. Free cash flow from continuing operations (a non-GAAP financial measure) decreased to a use of $(1.1) billion in 2019 from a use of $(0.9) billion in 2018 , primarily due to higher capital expenditures in 2019. Capital expenditures increased 14% to $3.6 billion in 2019 , reflecting higher planned investments in our ChoiceLease and commercial rental fleets. Our debt balance of $7.9 billion as of December 31, 2019 increased 19% from the prior year reflecting financing for the higher planned vehicle capital spending. Our debt to equity ratio increased to 320% from 262% in 2018 reflecting higher debt and a decrease in our equity balance due to the net loss in 2019. We increased our annualized dividend rate by 4% to $2.24 per share of common stock during 2019 . 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) FULL YEAR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Lease & Related Maintenance and Rental Change 2019 2018 2017 2019/2018 2018/2017 (In thousands) Lease & related maintenance and rental revenues $ 3,784,744 $ 3,512,867 $ 3,220,705 8% 9% Cost of lease & related maintenance and rental 3,103,703 2,555,358 2,353,209 21 9 Gross margin $ 681,041 $ 957,509 $ 867,496 (29)% 10% Gross margin % 18 % 27 % 27 % Lease & related maintenance and rental revenues represent ChoiceLease and commercial rental product offerings within our FMS business segment. Revenues increased 8% and 9% in 2019 and 2018 , respectively, from higher ChoiceLease revenue, driven by growth in the average ChoiceLease fleet ( up 9% in 2019 and 4% in 2018 ), and higher prices on replacement vehicles. Lease & related maintenance and rental revenue growth in 2019 and 2018 also reflects higher commercial rental revenue driven by higher pricing and demand. Cost of lease & related maintenance and rental represents the direct costs related to lease & related maintenance and rental revenues and are comprised of depreciation of revenue earning equipment, maintenance costs (primarily repair parts and labor), and other costs such as licenses, insurance and operating taxes. Cost of lease & related maintenance and rental excludes interest costs from vehicle financing, which are reported within "Interest expense" in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Cost of lease & related maintenance and rental increased 21% in 2019 due to higher depreciation expense of approximately $297 million related to the change in estimate for residual values of our lease and commercial rental fleet in our FMS business segment in the third quarter of 2019 (of the total increase in depreciation expense of $317 million ), as well as higher insurance costs of $27 million related to higher claim activity and adverse development on prior year claims. These costs also increased from a larger average lease and rental fleet, partially offset by a significant maintenance cost recovery item. Cost of lease & related maintenance and rental increased 9% in 2018 due to higher depreciation and maintenance costs on a larger average lease and rental fleet, policy depreciation changes of $40 million and accelerated depreciation of $39 million in 2018 and $30 million in 2017. Lease & related maintenance and rental gross margin decreased 29% and gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 18% in 2019 . The decrease in gross margin dollars in 2019 was primarily due to higher depreciation as a result of changes in our vehicle residual value estimates in the third quarter of 2019. Lease & related maintenance and rental gross margin increased 10% and gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained flat at 27% in 2018 . The 2018 increase in gross margin dollars was due to increased commercial rental utilization, reflecting strong demand, and lease fleet growth, partially offset by higher depreciation from residual value changes as well as accelerated depreciation and higher maintenance costs on certain older model vehicles. Refer to "Critical Accounting Estimates" below and Note 7, "Revenue Earning Equipment, net" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on policy and accelerated depreciation and the changes in our vehicle residual value estimates in the third quarter of 2019 which primarily impacted our FMS business segment. Services Change 2019 2018 2017 2019/2018 2018/2017 (In thousands) Services revenue $ 4,555,692 $ 4,280,834 $ 3,538,869 6% 21% Cost of services 3,879,863 3,663,348 2,977,426 6 23 Gross margin $ 675,829 $ 617,486 $ 561,443 9% 10% Gross margin % 15 % 14 % 16 % Services revenue represents all the revenues associated with our SCS and DTS business segments, as well as SelectCare and fleet support services associated with our FMS business segment. Services revenue increased 6% and 21% in 2019 and 2018 , respectively, due to new business, increased volumes and higher pricing in SCS and DTS. Services revenue also reflects 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) the MXD acquisition since the second quarter of 2018 and benefits from higher fuel costs passed through to our SCS and DTS customers in 2018. Cost of services represents the direct costs related to services revenue and is primarily comprised of salaries and employee-related costs, subcontracted transportation (purchased transportation from third parties), fuel, vehicle liability costs and maintenance costs. Cost of services increased 6% in 2019 due to the growth of SCS and DTS. Cost of services increased 23% in 2018 due to higher volumes and higher fuel costs. Services gross margin increased 9 % and 10% in 2019 and 2018 , respectively, reflecting benefits from revenue growth in our SCS and DTS segments. In 2019, there was also a benefit from favorable insurance claim developments of $5 million. In 2018 , benefits from revenue growth were partially offset by higher costs incurred during the start-up phase of a new DTS customer account. Services gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 15% in 2019 , reflecting improved operating performance in SCS and DTS. Services gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 14% in 2018 , reflecting a change in the mix of business. Fuel Change 2019 2018 2017 2019/2018 2018/2017 (In thousands) Fuel services revenue $ 585,365 $ 620,245 $ 520,500 (6)% 19% Cost of fuel services 571,658 605,613 507,440 (6) 19 Gross margin $ 13,707 $ 14,632 $ 13,060 (6)% 12% Gross margin % 2 % 2 % 3 % Fuel services revenue represents fuel services provided to our FMS customers. Fuel services revenue decreased 6% in 2019 primarily reflecting lower fuel costs passed through to customers. Fuel services revenue increased 19% in 2018 due to higher fuel costs passed through to customers. Cost of fuel services includes the direct costs associated with providing our customers with fuel. These costs include fuel, salaries and employee-related costs of fuel island attendants and depreciation of our fueling facilities and equipment. Cost of fuel services decreased 6% in 2019 as a result of lower price and volume. Cost of fuel services increased 19% in 2018 due to higher fuel costs. Fuel services gross margin decreased 6% in 2019 and increased 12% in 2018 . Fuel services gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained flat at 2% in 2019 and decreased to 2% in 2018 . Fuel is largely a pass-through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in margin during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, fuel services margin is impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time, as customer pricing for fuel is established based on trailing market fuel costs. Fuel services gross margin was impacted by these price change dynamics as fuel prices fluctuated during the periods. Other operating expenses Change 2019 2018 2017 2019/2018 2018/2017 (In thousands) Other operating expenses $ 121,980 $ 123,964 $ 115,019 (2)% 8% Other operating expenses include costs related to our owned and leased facilities within the FMS business segment, such as facility depreciation, rent, purchased insurance, utilities and taxes. These facilities are utilized to provide maintenance to our FMS customers. Other operating expenses decreased slightly in 2019 . Other operating expenses increased in 2018 due to higher facility maintenance and weather-related utility costs. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses Change 2019 2018 2017 2019/2018 2018/2017 (In thousands) Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 907,449 $ 849,410 $ 870,918 7% (2)% Percentage of total revenue 10% 10% 12% SG&A expenses increased 7% in 2019 and decreased 2% in 2018 . The increase in 2019 primarily reflects higher compensation-related expenses, as well as growth-related investments in sales, marketing and technology. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to cost savings initiatives implemented during 2018 and lower compensation-related costs. Non-operating pension costs Change 2019 2018 2017 2019/2018 2018/2017 (In thousands) Non-operating pension costs $ 60,406 $ 7,541 $ 27,741 NM NM Non-operating pension costs includes the components of our net periodic benefit cost other than service cost. These components include interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial loss and prior service cost, as well as settlement or curtailment charges. Non-operating pension costs increased by $53 million in 2019 due to a pension settlement charge of $32 million related to employee benefit settlements from the U.S. pension plan in 2019 and unfavorable asset returns in 2018, partially offset by higher interest rates. Non-operating pension costs decreased by $20 million in 2018 due to the benefit of favorable asset returns in 2017 and lower interest rates, partially offset by a pension settlement charge of $3 million related to employee benefit settlements from our U.K. pension plan. Losses on used vehicle sales, net Change 2019 2018 2017 2019/2018 2018/2017 (In thousands) Losses on used vehicle sales, net $ 58,706 $ 22,325 $ 16,989 NM 31% Losses on used vehicle sales, net includes gains and losses from sales of used vehicles, selling costs associated with used vehicles and write-downs of vehicles held for sale to fair market value (referred to as "valuation adjustments"). Losses on used vehicle sales, net was $59 million in 2019 as compared to $22 million in 2018 primarily due to higher valuation adjustments on a larger inventory, as well as lower sales prices. Losses on used vehicle sales, net was $22 million in 2018 as compared to $17 million in 2017 primarily due to lower gains from sales of used vehicles driven by the mix and volume of units sold in 2018, partially offset by lower valuation adjustments. Global average proceeds per unit in 2019 decreased for both tractors and trucks due to higher sales volumes in the wholesale markets which generally have lower proceeds per unit. In the fourth quarter, we also experienced a decrease in proceeds per unit in the retail markets and we expect these trends to continue in 2020. Global average proceeds per unit in 2018 increased for both tractors and trucks primarily due to a higher mix of retail sales, as well as lower average age of vehicles sold and improved market pricing. The following table presents the used vehicle pricing changes for 2019 and 2018 compared with the respective prior years: Proceeds per unit change 2019/2018 2018/2017 Tractors (3)% 12% Trucks (6)% 9% 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Interest expense Change 2019 2018 2017 2019/2018 2018/2017 (In thousands) Interest expense $ 241,381 $ 180,488 $ 141,876 34% 27% Effective interest rate 3.3% 3.0% 2.6% Interest expense increased 34% to $241 million in 2019 reflecting higher average outstanding debt and a higher effective interest rate. The increase in average outstanding debt reflects higher planned vehicle capital spending. The higher effective interest rate in 2019 reflects the replacement of lower fixed interest rate debt with debt issuances at higher fixed rates. Interest expense increased 27% to $180 million in 2018 reflecting a higher effective interest rate and higher average outstanding debt. The higher effective interest rate in 2018 reflects the replacement of lower fixed interest rate debt with debt issuances at higher fixed rates as well as the impact on variable rate debt of an increasing interest rate environment. The increase in average outstanding debt reflects higher planned vehicle capital spending as well as acquisitions. Miscellaneous income, net Change 2019 2018 2017 2019/2018 2018/2017 (In thousands) Miscellaneous (income) loss, net $ (33,642 ) $ (5,422 ) $ (44,245 ) NM NM Refer to Note 25 , " Miscellaneous Income, Net " in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Provision for income taxes Change 2019 2018 2017 2019/2018 2018/2017 (In thousands) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ (18,999 ) $ 102,547 $ (423,665 ) NM NM Effective tax rate from continuing operations 44.9% 26.3% (142.9)% Our provision for income taxes and effective income tax rates from continuing operations are impacted by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation (including the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), settlement of tax audits, and the expiration of statutes of limitations. In 2019, the effective tax rate was impacted by losses due to the residual value estimate change in the third quarter of 2019, as well as an increase in the expiration of state net operating losses and the release of uncertain tax position reserves due to the expiration of statutes of limitations. In 2019 and 2018, the effective tax rate was also impacted by the lower federal rate associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The 2017 tax rate reflects the net impact of the remeasurement of our deferred taxes and the transition tax as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Refer to Note 12 , Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 33 ITEM 7.

Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this MD&A for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue and segment total revenue to segment operating revenue for FMS, SCS and DTS, as well as the reasons why management believes these measures are important to investors. (2) Refer to Note 22 , " Other Items Impacting Comparability ," and below for a discussion of items excluded from our primary measure of segment performance. As part of management evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as "Earnings from continuing operations before taxes" (EBT), which includes an allocation of Central Support Services (CSS), and excludes non-operating pension costs and restructuring and other items, net, as described in Note 22 , Other Items Impacting Comparability , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including finance and procurement, corporate services, human resources, information technology, public affairs, legal, marketing and corporate communications. The objective of the EBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS, including costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 26 , Segment Reporting , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the methodology for allocating the remainder of CSS costs to the business segments. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to the SCS and DTS segments. Inter-segment revenue and EBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. EBT related to inter-segment equipment and services billed to SCS and DTS customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the segment that served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations in the table above). Inter-segment EBT allocated to SCS and DTS includes earnings related to equipment used in providing services to SCS and DTS customers. Refer to Note 26 , " Segment Reporting " in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Prior year amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation, which excludes EBT from our Singapore operations that were shut down during the second quarter of 2019.

SCS and DTS equipment contribution decreased 18% and 22% , respectively, in 2019 , primarily related to the impact of higher depreciation expense due to the change in estimate for residual values on vehicles used to provide services to SCS and DTS customers. Refer to "Critical Accounting Estimates" below and Note 8, "Revenue Earning Equipment, net" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the changes in our vehicle residual value estimates. SCS and DTS equipment contribution increased 22% and 18% , respectively, in 2018 , primarily driven by new business.

FMS total revenue increased 6% to $5.6 billion in 2019 and 11% to $5.3 billion in 2018 . FMS operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel) increased 8% to $4.8 billion in 2019 and 10% to $4.4 billion in 2018 . The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: 2019/2018 2018/2017 Total Operating (1) Total Operating (1) Organic, including price and volume 7% 8% 8% 10% Fuel (1) 3 Total increase 6% 8% 11% 10% (1) Non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of FMS total revenue to FMS operating revenue, as well as the reasons why management believes this measure is important to investors, is included in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section of this MD&A. 2019 versus 2018 ChoiceLease revenue increased 9% in 2019 reflecting a larger average fleet size as well as higher prices on replacement vehicles. The average number of ChoiceLease vehicles increased 9% from the prior year reflecting continuing sales activity. We expect ChoiceLease revenue growth to slow next year due to a lower OEM production environment, the non-renewal of lease business with lower returns and anticipated lost business related to the discontinuation of our liability insurance program to ChoiceLease customers. SelectCare revenue increased 8% in 2019 due to increased volumes. Commercial rental revenue increased 5% in 2019 due to higher pricing and demand. We expect unfavorable commercial rental comparisons next year based on a weakening demand environment and a smaller fleet. Fuel services revenue decreased 4% in 2019 due to lower fuel costs passed through to customers. FMS EBT decreased in 2019 primarily driven by higher depreciation expense of approximately $297 million related to the change in estimate for residual values of our lease and commercial rental fleet in the third quarter of 2019 (of the total increase in depreciation expense of $317 million). FMS EBT also decreased by approximately $37 million in 2019 as used vehicle sales results reflected higher losses as a result of higher valuation adjustments on a larger inventory and lower expected sales prices. At the end of the second quarter of 2019, we began to experience softening in used vehicle market conditions, which intensified during the third quarter of 2019 and we now expect to continue throughout 2020. In addition, our inventory of used vehicles to be made available for sale was higher than expected, which has, and is expected to continue to, impact the 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) volume of used vehicle sales expected to be transacted through our wholesale channels. Due to these dynamics and our updated outlook, management concluded in the third quarter of 2019 that our residual value estimates likely exceeded the expected future values that would be realized upon the sale of power vehicles in our existing fleet and accordingly changed the vehicle residual value estimates. As a result of the change in vehicle residual value estimates, we expect higher depreciation expense on our current fleet in the future, which negatively impacted FMS EBT in 2019 as discussed above and will negatively impact FMS EBT in 2020 by approximately $275 million. We expect the negative impact of the higher depreciation expense on FMS EBT to decline each quarter going forward starting in 2020 through 2025. Refer to "Critical Accounting Estimates" below and Note 7 , "Revenue Earning Equipment, net" in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, FMS EBT decreased due to higher insurance costs of $23 million from higher claim activity and adverse development of prior year claims. The impact of these items was partially offset as lease results benefited from a larger average fleet size, as well as higher prices on replacement vehicles. Commercial rental performance was lower reflecting lower utilization in 2019 . Rental power fleet utilization was 75.0% in 2019 , down from 79.2% in 2018 , on a 10% larger average rental power fleet. 2018 versus 2017 ChoiceLease revenue increased 7% in 2018 reflecting a larger average fleet size and higher prices on replacement vehicles. The average number of ChoiceLease vehicles increased 4% from the prior year reflecting continued solid sales activity. Commercial rental revenue increased 18% in 2018 due to stronger demand and higher pricing. SelectCare revenue increased 8% in 2018 due to sales activity and increased volumes. Fuel services revenue increased 23% in 2018 due to higher fuel costs passed through to customers. FMS EBT increased 15% in 2018 primarily driven by growth in commercial rental and ChoiceLease, as well as cost savings initiatives implemented during 2018. These benefits were partially offset by higher depreciation of $40 million due to residual value estimate changes and accelerated depreciation of $9 million to vehicles expected to be made available for sale through June 2020; higher compensation-related expenses; and unfavorable self-insurance developments. Commercial rental performance improved in 2018 due to increased utilization reflecting stronger demand and higher pricing. Rental power fleet utilization was 79.2% in 2018 , up from 75.6% in 2017 , on a 10% larger average rental power fleet. ChoiceLease comparisons benefited from fleet growth. Used vehicle sales results declined $5 million reflecting lower gains from sales of used vehicles due to the mix and volume of units sold, partially offset by lower valuation adjustments. The following table provides commercial rental statistics on our global fleet: Change 2019 2018 2017 2019/2018 2018/2017 (In thousands, except vehicle counts) Rental revenue from non-lease customers (1) $ 609,840 $ 566,612 $ 517,874 8% 9% Rental revenue from lease customers (2) $ 399,246 $ 393,994 $ 295,665 1% 33% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service (3), (4) 36,000 32,800 29,700 10% 10% Commercial rental utilization power fleet (3) 75.0% 79.2% 75.6% (420) bps 360 bps ______________ (1) Also includes additional vehicles rented to lease customers, incremental to the lease fleet.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) The totals in the previous table include the following non-revenue earning equipment for the global fleet (rounded to the nearest hundred): December 31, Change Number of Units 2019 2018 2017 2019/2018 2018/2017 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 3,500 4,500 2,900 (22)% 55% No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 9,400 6,900 6,000 36 15 Other NLE units 8,400 4,300 3,400 95 26 Total NLE 17,800 11,200 9,400 59% 19% Total 21,300 15,700 12,300 36% 28% NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. The number of NYE units decreased 22% in 2019 reflecting quicker customer fulfillment activities. The number of NYE units increased in 2018 reflecting lease fleet growth and a significant amount of deliveries close to the end of the year. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2019 , the number of NLE units increased 59% reflecting a higher number of vehicles being prepared for sale or redeployment and a higher number of contract terminations, as well as higher used vehicle inventories as a result of lower demand. For 2018 , the number of NLE units increased 19% reflecting higher used vehicle inventories and a higher number of vehicles being prepared for sale at the end of the year. We expect NLE units to decrease in 2020 as a result of higher redeployments of used vehicles.

SCS total revenue increased 6% to $2.6 billion in 2019 and 24% to $2.4 billion in 2018 . SCS operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) increased 6% to $1.9 billion in 2019 and 17% to $1.8 billion in 2018 . We expect favorable operating revenue comparisons to continue next year at a slower growth rate. 39 ITEM 7.

SCS EBT increased 11% in 2019 driven by revenue growth and improved operating performance, partially offset by a decrease in equipment contribution of $4.8 million (see further discussions on equipment contribution above). We expect equipment contribution to be negatively impacted in the future due to the change in the vehicle residual value estimates in the third quarter of 2019 for the FMS revenue earning equipment that is utilized in the SCS business. However, we do not expect this impact to SCS EBT to be material. 2018 versus 2017 SCS total revenue increased 24% in 2018 due to increased volumes and new business, the MXD acquisition, as well as higher fuel costs passed through to our customers. SCS operating revenue increased 17% primarily reflecting increased volumes, the MXD acquisition and new business. SCS EBT increased 32% in 2018 driven by revenue growth and better operating results.

DTS EBT increased 33% due to revenue growth, increased rates, improved operating performance and favorable insurance claim developments, partially offset by a decrease in equipment contribution of $8.1 million (see further discussions on equipment contribution above). We expect equipment contribution to be negatively impacted in the future due to the change in the vehicle residual value estimates in the third quarter of 2019 for the FMS revenue earning equipment that is utilized in the DTS business. However, we do not expect this impact to DTS EBT to be material. 2018 versus 2017 DTS total revenue increased 22% in 2018 reflecting higher operating revenue, as well as higher fuel costs passed through to our customers. DTS operating revenue increased 10% due to new business and increased volumes. DTS EBT increased 11% due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher costs incurred during the start-up phase of a new customer account.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from continuing operations: Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,140,539 $ 1,717,993 $ 1,628,098 Investing activities (3,217,193 ) (2,821,459 ) (1,438,676 ) Financing activities 1,084,139 1,085,515 (162,055 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash (4,272 ) 4,694 (5,539 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,213 $ (13,257 ) $ 21,828 Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities (In thousands) Earnings (loss) from continuing operations $ (23,272 ) $ 286,922 $ 720,101 Non-cash and other, net 2,178,662 1,716,802 983,981 Collections on sales-type leases 121,201 82,803 81,015 Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Receivables 27,149 (193,144 ) (178,861 ) Accounts payable (26,596 ) 16,869 66,149 Changes in other assets and liabilities (136,605 ) (192,259 ) (44,287 ) Cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations $ 2,140,539 $ 1,717,993 $ 1,628,098 2019 versus 2018 Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $2.1 billion in 2019 compared with $1.7 billion in 2018 reflecting higher cash earnings as well as lower working capital needs. Our working capital needs are primarily driven by the timing of collections of our receivables and payments of our trade payables, as well as other changes in operating assets and liabilities. The favorable impact in receivables was primarily due to improved collection efforts in our SCS and DTS segments. The unfavorable impact from trade payables was due to timing of payments. In addition, the favorable impact from changes in other assets and liabilities was driven by lower insurance and income tax payments, partially offset by higher payments related to our pension plans in 2019 and higher bonus payments in 2019. Cash used in investing activities increased to $3.2 billion in 2019 compared with $2.8 billion in 2018 primarily due to increased capital expenditures for planned vehicle purchases, partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue-earning equipment and operating property and equipment. Cash provided by financing activities was $1.1 billion in both 2019 and 2018 . 2018 versus 2017 Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.7 billion in 2018 compared with $1.6 billion in 2017 reflecting higher cash earnings offset by higher working capital needs. The unfavorable impact from trade payables was due to timing of payments. In addition, the unfavorable impact from changes in other assets and liabilities was driven by higher tax payments and lower accruals for salaries and wages, partially offset by lower pension payments. Cash used in investing activities increased to $2.8 billion in 2018 compared with $1.4 billion in 2017 primarily due to increased capital expenditures. Cash provided by financing activities was $1.1 billion in 2018 compared with cash used in financing activities of $162 million in 2017 due to higher borrowing needs. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) The following table shows the components of our free cash flow: 2019 2018 2017 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,140,539 $ 1,717,993 $ 1,628,098 Sales of revenue earning equipment (1) 465,705 379,716 376,743 Sales of operating property and equipment (1) 52,276 16,606 52,257 Total cash generated (2) 2,658,520 2,114,315 2,057,098 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1) (3,735,174 ) (3,050,409 ) (1,860,436 ) Free cash flow (2) $ (1,076,654 ) $ (936,094 ) $ 196,662 (1) Included in cash flows from investing activities. (2) Non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of net cash provided by operating activities to total cash generated and to free cash flow are set forth in this table. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this MD&A for the reasons why management believes these measures are important to investors. Free cash flow decreased to $(1.1) billion in 2019 from $(936) million in 2018 primarily due to higher capital expenditures, partially offset by higher cash flows from operations in 2019 . Free cash flow decreased to $(936) million in 2018 from $197 million in 2017 primarily due to higher capital expenditures in 2018 . We expect cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations to decrease to approximately $2.1 billion in 2020 due to earnings growth adjusted for non-cash items, primarily depreciation. We expect 2020 free cash flow to increase to approximately $350 million reflecting lower capital spending for the lease and rental vehicle fleets. Capital expenditures generally represent the purchase of revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the ChoiceLease and commercial rental product lines. The level of capital required to support the ChoiceLease product line varies based on customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long-term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over three to seven years for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. We utilize capital for the purchase of vehicles in our commercial rental product line to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter-term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2019 2018 2017 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: ChoiceLease $ 2,871,043 $ 2,206,500 $ 1,456,758 Commercial rental 556,560 796,617 351,707 3,427,603 3,003,117 1,808,465 Operating property and equipment 192,820 162,154 132,752 Total capital expenditures (1) 3,620,423 3,165,271 1,941,217 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment 114,751 (114,862 ) (80,781 ) Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ (3,735,174 ) $ (3,050,409 ) $ (1,860,436 ) _____________ (1) Non-cash additions exclude approximately $22 million , $15 million and $23 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, in assets held under finance leases resulting from new or the extension of existing finance leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased to $3.6 billion in 2019 reflecting planned higher investments in the ChoiceLease fleet. Capital expenditures increased to $3.2 billion in 2018 reflecting planned higher investments in the ChoiceLease and commercial rental fleets. We expect capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $2.1 billion in 2020 primarily due to lower growth in our lease and rental vehicle fleets. We expect to fund 2020 capital expenditures primarily with additional debt financing. 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset-based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long-term and medium-term public and private debt, asset-backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements, and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of unsecured commercial paper and medium-term notes. Cash and equivalents totaled $74 million as of December 31, 2019 . As of December 31, 2019 , approximately $21 million was held outside the U.S. and is available to fund operations and other growth of non-U.S. subsidiaries. If we decide to repatriate cash and equivalents held outside the U.S., we may be subject to additional income and withholding taxes. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these foreign amounts outside the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these foreign amounts to fund our U.S. operations. We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to the public unsecured bond market, commercial paper market and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in the public unsecured bond market or the commercial paper market would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to public bonds, commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or by seeking other funding sources. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is impacted by both our short-term and long-term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short-term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper and likely require us to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, assuming ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings and rating outlooks at December 31, 2019 were as follows: Rating Summary Short-term Long-term Outlook Fitch Ratings F2 A- Stable Standard & Poor Ratings Services A2 BBB Stable Moody Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable DBRS R-1 (Low) A (Low) Stable At December 31, 2019 , we had the following amounts available to fund operations: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $744 Trade receivables program $225 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to align the aggregate average remaining re-pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re-pricing life of our vehicle assets. We utilize both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to achieve this alignment and generally target a mix of 20% - 40% variable-rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable-rate portion of our total debt (including notional value of swap agreements) was 17% and 28% at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Refer to Note 14 , " Debt " in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility, the trade receivables program, the issuance of medium-term notes under our shelf registration statement, asset-backed financing obligations and debt maturities. Our debt to equity ratios were 320% and 262% at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The debt to equity ratio represents total debt divided by total equity. The increase in our debt to equity ratio reflects higher debt and a decrease in our equity balance due to the net loss in 2019. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees. Refer to Note 15 , Guarantees , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our agreements involving guarantees. 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2019 : Total 2020 2021-2022 2023-2024 Thereafter (In thousands) Debt (1) $ 7,898,484 $ 1,322,055 $ 2,378,765 $ 3,441,759 $ 755,905 Finance lease obligations 61,155 14,663 22,390 11,541 12,561 Total debt, including finance leases 7,959,639 1,336,718 2,401,155 3,453,300 768,466 Interest on debt (2) 707,704 208,165 320,308 141,846 37,385 Operating leases (3) 243,516 79,345 100,496 45,220 18,455 Purchase obligations (4) 533,621 486,979 34,822 10,865 955 Total contractual cash obligations 1,484,841 774,489 455,626 197,931 56,795 Insurance obligations (primarily self-insurance) 438,371 152,533 141,501 61,101 83,236 Other long-term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 72,106 3,162 5,035 5,842 58,067 Total $ 9,954,957 $ 2,266,902 $ 3,003,317 $ 3,718,174 $ 966,564 ____________ (1) Net of unamortized discount and excludes the fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2026 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable-rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate as of December 31, 2019 . Amounts are based on existing debt obligations and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay-as-you-go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2020 , our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by U.S. and international regulations and legislation (including ERISA), are expected to be $37 million . Our minimum funding requirements after 2020 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $276 million (pre-tax) (assuming expected long-term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay-as-you-go. See Note 20 , Employee Benefit Plans , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $54 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 12 , Income Taxes , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 45 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Pension Information We have defined benefit retirement plans which are frozen for non-grandfathered and certain non-union employees in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2019 , total global pension contributions were $72 million compared with $28 million in 2018 and $41 million in 2017 . We estimate 2020 required pension contributions will be $37 million . The present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $254 million (pre-tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 20 , Employee Benefit Plans , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after-tax) of $667 million and $712 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The improvement in funded status reflects the benefit of asset returns of 19% in 2019 , partially offset by a decrease in discount rates. Pension expense was $82 million , $30 million , and $57 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The increase in pension expense was due to a pension settlement charge of $32 million related to employee benefit settlements from the U.S. pension plan in 2019 and unfavorable asset returns in 2018, partially offset by higher interest rates. We expect 2020 pension expense to decrease approximately $54 million as a result of the non-recurring settlement charges in 2019, as well as favorable asset returns in 2019 and a decrease in interest rates. Our 2020 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans section for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in certain U.S. multi-employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2019 , approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our MEP plan contributions in 2019 was $11 million . Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company-specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon certain requirements, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plan unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. During 2017, we recorded estimated pension settlement charges of $5 million related to our exit from a U.S. multi-employer pension plan. These charges were recorded within "Selling, general and administrative expenses" in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings and included in the Union-administered plans expense. See Note 20 , Employee Benefit Plans , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 16 , Share Repurchase Programs , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $116 million in 2019 , $112 million in 2018 , and $96 million in 2017 . During 2019 , we increased our annualized dividend rate 4% to $2.24 per share of common stock. 46 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. A hypothetical 10% change in short-term market interest rates would change annual pre-tax earnings by approximately $12 million . We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed-rate and variable-rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. The fair value of derivatives was not material as of December 31, 2019 . At December 31, 2019, we had $5.7 billion of fixed-rate debt outstanding (excluding finance leases and U.S. asset- backed securities) with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.18% and a fair value of $5.6 billion . A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2019 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $47 million at December 31, 2019 . Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2019 , we had $1.4 billion of variable-rate debt, including $525 million of fixed-rate debt instruments swapped to LIBOR-based floating-rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our variable-rate debt at December 31, 2019 was $1.4 billion . A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2019 pre-tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $3 million . We are also subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would not materially impact results of operations. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the foreign currency exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we have no near-term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2019 , we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Changes in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on trailing market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 21 , Environmental Matters , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 47 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryder Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Estimates. We periodically review and adjust, as appropriate, the estimated residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment for the purposes of recording depreciation expense as described in Note 7 , Revenue Earning Equipment, Net " in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our review of the estimated residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) and useful lives of revenue earning equipment is established with a long-term view based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage, as well as other factors. We refer to this long-term view as "policy depreciation." These other factors include, but are not limited to, historical market prices, current and expected future market prices, expected lives of vehicles, and expected sales of used vehicles in the wholesale and retail markets. Reductions in estimated residual values or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the remaining life of the equipment. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from estimates include, but are not limited to, changes in technology; changes in supply and demand; competitor pricing; regulatory requirements; driver shortages, requirements and preferences; and changes in underlying assumption factors. As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. We have disciplines related to the management and maintenance of our vehicles designed to manage the risk associated with the residual values of our revenue earning equipment. At the end of the second quarter of 2019, we began to experience softening in used vehicle market conditions, which intensified during the third quarter of 2019 and we now expect to continue throughout 2020. In addition, our inventory of used vehicles that is expected to be made available for sale was higher than expected, which has and will impact the volume of used vehicle sales expected to be sold through our wholesale channels. Due to these dynamics and our updated outlook, we concluded that our residual value estimates likely exceeded the expected future values that would be realized upon the sale of power vehicles in our fleet. As a result, we changed the estimates of our residual values for our revenue earning equipment in the third quarter of 2019 to reflect more recent multi-year trends and our outlook for the expected used vehicle market. In 2019, the impact to policy depreciation and accelerated depreciation related to the change in the residual value estimates that occurred in the third quarter of 2019 was $104 million and $193 million , respectively. Each year, we complete a review of the estimated residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we adjust the estimated residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment each year. The approximate unfavorable incremental impact on the annual depreciation expense resulting from the residual value and useful life reviews was as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Policy depreciation $205 million $134 million $40 million The impact of policy depreciation in 2019 included the vehicle residual values estimate change that occurred in the third quarter of 2019, as well as $30 million of depreciation expense related to the policy depreciation estimate change effective January 1, 2019. 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) In addition, we also monitor market trends throughout the year and assess estimates of residual values of vehicles expected to be made available for sale in the near-term (generally 12 to 24 months) and may adjust residual values for these vehicles to reflect current market rates, which we refer to as accelerated depreciation. Following the completion of our review in the third quarter of 2019, the near-term forecast for realized residual values on used vehicle sales was below our estimates of residual value as discussed above. As a result, we adjusted the estimated residual values for these vehicles and increased accelerated depreciation expense for these vehicles beginning in the third quarter of 2019. The approximate unfavorable incremental impact on annual depreciation expense resulting from accelerated depreciation was as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Accelerated depreciation $70 million $223 million $39 million Depreciation expense was $1.9 billion , $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased in 2019 driven by the change in estimated residual values in the third quarter of 2019 as discussed above. Depreciation expense increased in 2018 driven by larger average lease and commercial rental fleets and accelerated depreciation on vehicles expected to be made available for sale through June 2020 of $9 million . The impact of the estimate change in 2019 as a percentage of our original vehicle investment (cost) of our revenue earning equipment was approximately 5% at December 31, 2019 . Based on our fleet of revenue earning equipment as of December 31, 2019 , a hypothetical additional 10% reduction in estimated residual values used for policy depreciation would increase depreciation expense in 2020 by approximately $111 million and would increase depreciation expense over the remaining life of these vehicles beyond 2020 by approximately $222 million . Revenue Recognition . We generate revenue primarily through contracts with customers to lease, rent and maintain revenue earning equipment and to provide logistics management and dedicated transportation services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectibility of consideration is probable. We recognize revenue upon the transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We generally recognize revenue over time as we perform because of continuous transfer of control to our customers. We offer a full service lease as well as a lease with more flexible maintenance options under our ChoiceLease product line in our FMS business segment, which are marketed, priced and managed as bundled products, that include the equipment lease, maintenance and other related services. We do not offer a stand-alone lease of new vehicles. Our ChoiceLease product line includes the lease of a vehicle (lease component) and maintenance and other services (non-lease component). Contract consideration is allocated between the lease and non-lease components based on management's best estimate of the relative stand-alone selling price of each component. Allocating consideration between the lease and maintenance components in our ChoiceLease product requires significant judgment. We do not sell the components of our ChoiceLease product offering on a stand-alone basis, therefore significant judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling prices of the lease and maintenance components in order to allocate the consideration on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. For the lease component, we estimate the stand-alone selling price using the projected cash outflows related to the underlying leased vehicle, net of the estimated disposal proceeds, and a certain targeted return considering the weighted average cost of capital. For the non-lease component of the contract, we estimate the stand-alone selling price of the maintenance component using an expected cost-plus margin approach. The expected costs are based on our historical costs of providing maintenance services in our ChoiceLease arrangements. The margin is based on the historical margin percentages for our full service maintenance contracts in the SelectCare product line, as the maintenance performance obligation in those contracts is similar to maintenance in our ChoiceLease arrangements. Full service maintenance arrangements in SelectCare are priced based on targeted margin percentages for new and used vehicles by type of vehicle (trucks, tractors, and trailers), considering the fixed and variable costs of providing maintenance services. We recognize maintenance revenue using an input method, consistent with the estimated pattern of the costs to maintain the underlying vehicles. This generally results in the recognition of a contract liability for the portion of the customer's bill allocated to the maintenance service component of the agreement. The non-lease revenue component for maintenance included in lease & related maintenance and rental revenues was $950 million , $909 million and $832 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) The stand-alone price for both the lease and non-lease components could vary in the future based on both external market conditions and our pricing strategies as a result of the market conditions. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on assets, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to estimate the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long-term rate of return assumptions are based on a review of our asset allocation strategy and long-term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. Assumptions as to mortality of the participants in our pension plan is a key estimate in measuring the expected payments participants may receive over their lifetime, and therefore the amount of expense we will recognize. We update our mortality assumptions as deemed necessary by taking into consideration relevant actuarial studies as they become available as well as reassessing our own historical experience. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. Our U.S. pension investment policy and strategy seek to reduce the effects of future volatility on the fair value of our pension assets relative to our pension liabilities by increasing our allocation of high quality, longer-term fixed income securities and reducing our allocation of equity investments as the funded status of the plan improves. The composition of our pension assets was 45% equity securities and alternative assets and 55% debt securities and other investments as of December 31, 2019 . We continually evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. In 2020 , we adjusted our long-term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan to 5.10% from 5.40% based on our expected asset mix. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre-tax accumulated actuarial loss of $870 million and $930 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. To the extent the amount of cumulative actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or plan assets, the excess amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plan participants are inactive. As of December 31, 2019 , the amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2020 and future years is $637 million . We expect to recognize approximately $32 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2020 . The effect on years beyond 2020 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans in future years. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2019 net pension expense is presented in Note 20 , Employee Benefit Plans , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below: Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2020 Net Pension Expense Effect on December 31, 2019 Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long-term rate of return on assets 5.10% +/- 0.25 +/- $3.5 million N/A Discount rate 3.30% +/- 0.25 N/M +/- $54 million 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Self-Insurance Accruals. Self-insurance accruals were $411 million and $358 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The majority of our self-insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns, and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , we recognized a charge of $18 million , a charge of $1 million , and a benefit of $9 million , respectively, from the development of estimated prior years self-insured loss reserves. Based on self-insurance accruals at December 31, 2019 , a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2020 by approximately $19 million . Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. As of December 31, 2019 , total goodwill was $475 million . To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we are required to assess the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to its carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. We assess goodwill for impairment on October 1 st of each year or more often if deemed necessary. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary, such as macroeconomic conditions, changes in our industry and the markets in which we operate, and our market capitalization as well as our reporting units' historical and expected future financial performance. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value or we bypass the optional qualitative assessment, recoverability is assessed by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, we will measure any goodwill impairment losses as the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. For quantitative tests, we estimated the fair value of the reporting units using a combination of both an income and market approach. We perform our quantitative impairment test with the assistance of a third-party specialist. Under the market approach, we use a selection of comparable publicly-traded companies that correspond to the reporting unit to derive a market-based multiple. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the discounted present value of the projected future cash flows. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure, adjusted for equity and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and significant judgments and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including revenue growth rates, margins, long-term growth rates, capital requirements, proceeds from the sale of used vehicles, the ability to utilize our tax net operating losses, and the discount rate. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS and DTS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to our SCS or DTS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. In making our assessments of fair value, we rely on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist in the future. These assumptions are based on a number of factors, including future operating performance, economic conditions, actions we expect to take and present value techniques. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. It is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future. We conduct additional sensitivity analyses to assess the risk for potential impairment based upon changes in the key assumptions in our goodwill valuation test, including long-term growth rates and discount rates. In the third quarter of 2019, we performed an interim impairment test of our FMS North America reporting unit ( FMS NA ) as a result of the decline in market conditions and our updated outlook primarily in the used vehicle market, which negatively affects our forecasted cash flows from the sale of used vehicles. Based on our analysis, we determined that FMS NA goodwill was not impaired as of September 30, 2019. However, the fair value of FMS NA was not substantially in excess of its carrying amount. The estimated fair value of the FMS NA reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5%. As a result of a revised forecast and outlook for the FMS NA reporting unit as of December 31, 2019, we performed an additional impairment test. Based on our analysis, we determined that FMS NA goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2019. However, the fair value of FMS NA was not substantially in excess of its carrying amount. The estimated fair value of the FMS NA reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 15% as of December 31, 2019. 51 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) The increase in the estimated fair value of FMS NA in excess of its carrying value as compared to September 30, 2019 is due to improved estimated future cash flows from management actions which moderate future ChoiceLease growth assumptions, lower expected future capital expenditures and improve future profit margins. As of December 31, 2019, there was $244 million of goodwill recorded related to FMS NA. As the fair value is not substantially in excess of its carrying amount, in the event the financial performance of FMS NA does not meet our expectations in the future; we experience future prolonged market downturns, including in the used vehicle market or a sustained decline in our stock price; or other negative revisions to key assumptions, we may be required to perform additional impairment analyses and could be required to recognize a non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Subsequent to December 31, 2019, we experienced a decline in our market capitalization and if this decline continues for a sustained period of time, we may also be required to perform additional impairment analyses and could be required to recognize a non-cash goodwill impairment charge. On October 1, 2019, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for our SCS and DTS related reporting units and determined there was no impairments. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations can require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements can be different than that reported in the tax return. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years, for which we have already recognized the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets were $1.0 billion and $799 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We recognize a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to tax loss carryforwards, was $18 million and $16 million , respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on management expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. We accrue the largest amount of the benefit that has a cumulative probability of greater than 50% of being sustained. These accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position has been determined to be more likely than not of being sustained, (2) the tax position, amount and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statutes of limitations for the tax position has expired. See Note 12 , Income Taxes , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2 , Recent Accounting Pronouncements , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) NON-GAAP AND SEGMENT FINANCIAL MEASURES Non-GAAP Financial Measures. This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information that is not required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain elements of this information are considered non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. Also, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to financial measures used by other companies. We provide a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure in this non-GAAP financial measures section. We also provide the reasons why management believes each non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in this section. Specifically, we refer to the following non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K: Non-GAAP Financial Measure Comparable GAAP Measure Operating Revenue Measures: Operating Revenue Total Revenue FMS Operating Revenue FMS Total Revenue SCS Operating Revenue SCS Total Revenue DTS Operating Revenue DTS Total Revenue FMS EBT as a % of FMS Operating Revenue FMS EBT as a % of FMS Total Revenue SCS EBT as a % of SCS Operating Revenue SCS EBT as a % of SCS Total Revenue DTS EBT as a % of DTS Operating Revenue DTS EBT as a % of DTS Total Revenue Comparable Earnings Measures: Comparable Earnings (Loss) Before Income Tax Earnings (Loss) Before Income Tax Comparable Earnings (Loss) Earnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations Comparable EPS EPS from Continuing Operations Comparable Tax Rate Effective Tax Rate from Continuing Operations Adjusted Return on Equity (ROE) Not Applicable. However, non-GAAP elements of the calculation have been reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures. A numerical reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted net earnings and average shareholders' equity to adjusted average equity is provided in the following reconciliations. Adjusted Return on Capital (ROC) Not Applicable. However, non-GAAP elements of the calculation have been reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures. A numerical reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted net earnings and average total debt and average shareholders' equity to adjusted average total capital is provided in the following reconciliations. Cash Flow Measures: Total Cash Generated and Free Cash Flow Cash Provided by Operating Activities 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Set forth in the table below is an overview of each non-GAAP financial measure and why management believes that presentation of each non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. See reconciliations for each of these measures following this table. Operating Revenue Measures: Operating Revenue FMS Operating Revenue SCS Operating Revenue DTS Operating Revenue FMS EBT as a % of FMS Operating Revenue SCS EBT as a % of SCS Operating Revenue DTS EBT as a % of DTS Operating Revenue Operating revenue is defined as total revenue for Ryder System, Inc. or each business segment (FMS, SCS and DTS) excluding any (1) fuel and (2) subcontracted transportation. We believe operating revenue provides useful information to investors as we use it to evaluate the operating performance of our core businesses and as a measure of sales activity at the consolidated level for Ryder System, Inc., as well as for each of our business segments. We also use segment EBT as a percentage of segment operating revenue for each business segment for the same reason. Note: FMS EBT, SCS EBT and DTS EBT, our primary measures of segment performance, are not non-GAAP measures. Fuel : We exclude FMS, SCS and DTS fuel from the calculation of our operating revenue measures, as fuel is an ancillary service that we provide our customers, which is impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices and the costs are largely a pass-through to our customers, resulting in minimal changes in our profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by rapid changes in market fuel prices during a short period of time, as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on trailing market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation : We also exclude subcontracted transportation from the calculation of our operating revenue measures, as these services are also typically a pass-through to our customers and, therefore, fluctuations result in minimal changes to our profitability. While our SCS and DTS business segments subcontract certain transportation services to third party providers, our FMS business segment does not engage in subcontracted transportation and, therefore, this item is not applicable to FMS. Comparable Earnings Measures: Comparable Earnings (Loss) before Income Taxes (EBT) Comparable Earnings (Loss) Comparable earnings (loss) per diluted common share (EPS) Comparable Tax Rate Adjusted Return on Equity (ROE) Adjusted Return on Capital (ROC) Comparable EBT, comparable earnings and comparable EPS are defined, respectively, as GAAP EBT, earnings and EPS, all from continuing operations, excluding (1) non-operating pension costs and (2) any other significant items that are not representative of our business operations. We believe these comparable earnings measures provide useful information to investors and allow for better year-over-year comparison of operating performance. Non-operating pension costs : Our comparable earnings measures exclude non-operating pension costs, which include the amortization of net actuarial loss and prior service cost, interest cost and expected return on plan assets components of pension and postretirement benefit costs, as well as a settlement or curtailment of a plan. We exclude non-operating pension costs because we consider these to be impacted by financial market performance and outside the operational performance of our business. Other Items Impacting Comparability : Our comparable and adjusted earnings measures also exclude other significant items that are not representative of our business operations as detailed in the reconciliation table below. These other significant items vary from period to period and, in some periods, there may be no such significant items. Calculation of comparable tax rate : The comparable provision for income taxes is computed using the same methodology as the GAAP provision for income taxes. Income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated based on the statutory tax rates of the jurisdictions to which the non-GAAP adjustments relate. Adjusted ROE : Adjusted ROE is defined as adjusted net earnings divided by adjusted average shareholders' equity and represents the rate of return on shareholders' investment. Other items impacting comparability described above are excluded, as applicable, from the calculation of net earnings and average shareholders' equity. We use adjusted ROE as an internal measure of how effectively we use the owned capital invested in our operations. Adjusted ROC : Adjusted ROC is defined as adjusted net earnings divided by average total capital and represents the rate of return generated by the capital deployed in our business. Other items impacting comparability described above are excluded, as applicable, from the calculation of net earnings and average shareholders' equity (a component of average total capital).We use adjusted ROC as an internal measure of how effectively we use the capital invested (borrowed or owned) in our operations. 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Cash Flow Measures: Total Cash Generated Free Cash Flow We consider total cash generated and free cash flow to be important measures of comparative operating performance, as our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Total Cash Generated : Total cash generated is defined as the sum of (1) net cash provided by operating activities, (2) net cash provided by the sale of revenue earning equipment, (3) net cash provided by the sale of operating property and equipment, and (4) other cash inflows from investing activities. We believe total cash generated is an important measure of total cash flows generated from our ongoing business activities. Free Cash Flow : We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding acquisitions) from continuing operations as free cash flow . We calculate free cash flow as the sum of (1) net cash provided by operating activities, (2) net cash provided by the sale of revenue earning equipment, (3) net cash provided by the sale of operating property and equipment, and (4) other cash inflows from investing activities, less (5) purchases of property and revenue earning equipment. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders, after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) The following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP earnings (loss) before taxes (EBT), earnings (loss), and earnings (loss) per diluted share (Diluted EPS) from continuing operations to comparable EBT, comparable earnings and comparable EPS from continuing operations. Certain items included in EBT, earnings and diluted EPS from continuing operations have been excluded from our comparable EBT, comparable earnings and comparable diluted EPS measures.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) These statements, as well as other forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report, are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We caution readers that certain important factors could cause actual results and events to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. These risk factors include, but are not limited to, the following: Market Conditions: Changes in general economic and financial conditions in the U.S. and worldwide leading to decreased demand for our services, lower profit margins, increased levels of bad debt and reduced access to credit and financial markets. Decreases in freight demand which would impact both our transactional and variable-based contractual business. Changes in our customers operations, financial condition or business environment that may limit their demand for, or ability to purchase, our services. Decreases in market demand affecting the commercial rental market and used vehicle sales as well as global economic conditions. Volatility in customer volumes and shifting customer demand in the industries serviced by our SCS business. Changes in current financial, tax or regulatory requirements that could negatively impact our financial results. Competition: Advances in technology may impact demand for our services or may require increased investments to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments. Competition from other service providers, some of which have greater capital resources or lower capital costs, or from our customers, who may choose to provide services themselves. Continued consolidation in the markets in which we operate which may create large competitors with greater financial resources. Our inability to maintain current pricing levels due to economic conditions, demand for services, customer acceptance or competition. Profitability: Our inability to obtain adequate profit margins for our services. Lower than expected sales volumes or customer retention levels. Decreases in commercial rental fleet utilization and pricing. Lower than expected used vehicle sales pricing levels and fluctuations in the anticipated proportion of retail versus wholesale sales. Loss of key customers in our DTS and SCS business segments. Our inability to adapt our product offerings to meet changing consumer preferences on a cost-effective basis. The inability of our legacy information technology systems to provide timely access to data. Sudden changes in fuel prices and fuel shortages. Higher prices for vehicles, diesel engines and fuel as a result of new environmental standards. Higher than expected maintenance costs and lower than expected benefits associated with our maintenance initiatives. Our inability to successfully execute our asset management initiatives, maintain our fleet at normalized levels and right-size our fleet in line with demand. 62 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Our key assumptions and pricing structure of our DTS and SCS contracts prove to be inaccurate. Increased unionizing, labor strikes and work stoppages. Difficulties in attracting and retaining drivers and technicians due to driver and technician shortages, which may result in higher costs to procure drivers and technicians and higher turnover rates affecting our customers. Our inability to manage our cost structure. Our inability to limit our exposure for customer claims. Unfavorable or unanticipated outcomes in legal or regulatory proceedings or uncertain positions. Business interruptions or expenditures due to severe weather or natural occurrences. Financing Concerns: Higher borrowing costs. Unanticipated interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Negative funding status of our pension plans caused by lower than expected returns on invested assets and unanticipated changes in interest rates. Withdrawal liability as a result of our participation in multi-employer plans. Instability in U.S. and worldwide credit markets, resulting in higher borrowing costs and/or reduced access to credit. Accounting Matters: Reductions in residual values or useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Increases in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality resulting in higher pension expense; regulatory changes affecting pension estimates, accruals and expenses. Changes in accounting rules, assumptions and accruals. Difficulties and delays in implementing our Enterprise Resource Planning system and related processes. Other risks detailed from time to time in our SEC filings, including in Item 1A.-Risk Factors of this Annual Report. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on our business. As a result, no assurance can be given as to our future results or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. We do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 63 ITEM 7A.
