ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of Veris Residential, Inc. and Veris Residential, L.P. and the notes thereto (collectively, the Financial Statements ). Certain defined terms used herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these accounting policies require judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions when applying these policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experience as well as other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are subject to change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change. Certain accounting policies, while significant, may not require the use of estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Impairment On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance, changes in anticipated holding period, and general market conditions, that the value of the Company rental properties held for use may be impaired. A p roperty value is considered impaired when the expected undiscounted cash flows for a property are less than its carrying value. If there are different potential outcomes for a property, the Company will take a probability weighted approach to estimating future cash flows. To the extent impairment has occurred, the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the property over the estimated fair value of the property. Estimated fair values which are based on discounted cash flow models include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period. Capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon unobservable rates that the Company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates. In addition, such cash flow models consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. The Company generally considers assets (as identified by their disposal groups) to be held for sale when the transaction has received appropriate corporate authority, it is probable that the disposition will occur within one year and there are no significant contingencies relating to a sale. When assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the fair value. If the fair value of the assets, less estimated cost to sell, is less than the carrying value of the assets, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recognized and recorded within the Unrealized gains (losses) on disposition of rental property to reflect the estimated fair value of the assets. The Company will continue to review the property for subsequent changes in the fair value, and may recognize an additional impairment charge, if warranted. In addition, on a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including the underlying investment property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the Company investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. An investment is impaired only if management estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying value of the 28 Table of Contents investment over the estimated fair value of the investment. Estimated fair values which are based on discounted cash flow models include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period. Capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based upon unobservable rates that the Company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates. 29 Table of Contents Results From Operations The following comparisons for the year ended December 31, 2023 ( 2023 ), as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 ( 2022 ), and for 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 ( 2021 ) make reference to the following: (i) Same-Store Properties, which represent all in-service properties owned by the Company at December 31, 2021, (for the 2023 versus 2022 comparisons), and which represent all in-service properties owned by the Company at December 31, 2020 (for the 2022 versus 2021 comparisons), excluding properties sold, disposed of, removed from service, or being redeveloped or repositioned from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2023;

Revenue from leases at the Acquired and Developed Properties increased $27.6 million, or 164.7 percent, in 2023 as compared to 2022, due to an increase in market rental rates and the commencement of operations at a multifamily property as well as the acquisition of one multifamily property during mid-2022.

Real estate taxes on the Same-Store Properties decreased $1.1 million, or 2.8 percent, for 2023 as compared to 2022 due primarily to prior period tax appeal refunds received in 2023 on several properties offset by increased tax rates primarily related to properties located in Jersey City, New Jersey. Real estate taxes at the Acquired and Developed Properties increased $2.7 million, or 181.7 percent, in 2023 as compared to 2022, due to the commencement of operations at a multifamily property as well as the acquisition of one multifamily property during mid-2022.

General and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased $11.5 million, or 20.6 percent, for 2023 compared to 2022 due to decrease in severance and related costs and cost reductions in 2023, offset by higher stock compensation expense in 2023 as a result of the $2.9 million adjustment in the third quarter of 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Liquidity is a measurement of the Company's ability to meet cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, pay dividends, fund acquisitions of real estate assets and other general business needs. In addition to cash on hand, the primary sources of funds for short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including working capital, 36 Table of Contents distributions, debt service and additional investments, consist of: (i) borrowings under the revolving credit facility and term loan; (ii) proceeds from sales of real estate; and (iv) cash flow from operations. The Company believe these sources of financing will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements. The Company's cash flow from operations primarily consists of rental revenue which is the principal source of funds that is used to pay operating expenses, debt service, general and administrative expenses, operating capital expenditures, dividends, and transaction-related expenses. The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements generally through its working capital, which may include proceeds from the sales of rental properties and land, net cash provided by operating activities and draws from its revolving credit facility. Cash Flows Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased by $6.9 million to $54.6 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $47.6 million at December 31, 2022.

REIT Distribution Requirements To maintain its qualification as a REIT under the IRS Code, the General Partner must make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90 percent of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains. However, any such distributions, whether for federal income tax purposes or otherwise, would be paid out of available cash, including borrowings and other sources, after meeting operating requirements, preferred stock dividends and distributions, and scheduled debt service on the Company debt. If and to the extent the Company retains and does not distribute any net capital gains, the General Partner will be required to pay federal, state and local taxes on such net capital gains at the rate applicable to capital gains of a corporation. As a result of the Company substantially completing its transformation to a pure-play multifamily REIT, as well as the Company current estimates of taxable income, the Board of Directors of the General Partner (the "Board of Directors") reinstated a quarterly dividend beginning in the third quarter of 2023. The declaration and payment of dividends and distributions will continue to be determined by the Board of Directors of the General Partner in light of conditions then existing, including the Company's earnings, cash flows, financial condition, capital requirements, debt maturities, the availability of debt and equity capital, applicable REIT and legal restrictions and general overall economic conditions and other factors. On December 18, 2023, the Company declared a $0.0525 distribution per common share to be payable on January 10, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 29, 2023. At December 31, 2023, the balance of the 37 Table of Contents distributions payable was $5.5 million. The $0.0525 distribution per common share will be reported to shareholders for the year ending December 31, 2024. On July 24, 2023, the Company declared a $0.05 distribution per common share with a payment date of October 10, 2023, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 30, 2023. The Company has determined that the total distribution of $0.05 per common share paid during the year ended December 31, 2023 represented 100% return of capital distributions. The dividends and distributions payable at December 31, 2022 represent amounts payable on unvested LTIP units.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Unconsolidated Joint Venture Debt The debt of the Company unconsolidated joint ventures generally provides for recourse to the Company for customary matters such as intentional misuse of funds, environmental conditions and material misrepresentations. The Company has agreed to guarantee repayment of a portion of the debt of its unconsolidated joint ventures. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance of such debt totaled $17.2 million of which $1.5 million was guaranteed by the Company. In January 2024, the joint venture repaid the $17.2 million loan. The Company off-balance sheet arrangements are further discussed in Note 4: Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures to the Financial Statements. Funds from Operations Funds from operations ( FFO ) (available to common stock and unit holders) is defined as net income (loss) before noncontrolling interests in Operating Partnership, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from depreciable rental property transactions (including both acquisitions and dispositions), and impairments related to depreciable rental property, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity REIT. The Company further believes that as FFO excludes the effect of depreciation, gains (or losses) from property transactions and impairments related to depreciable rental property (all of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance), FFO can facilitate comparison of operating performance between equity REITs. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income available to common shareholders as an indication of the Company performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. However, the Company FFO is comparable to the FFO of real estate companies that use the current definition of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ). As the Company considers its primary earnings measure, net income available to common shareholders, as defined by GAAP, to be the most comparable earnings measure to FFO, the following table presents a reconciliation of net income 39 Table of Contents available to common shareholders to FFO, as calculated in accordance with NAREIT current definition, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 ( in thousands ): Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Net loss available to common shareholders $ (107,265) $ (52,066) $ (119,042) Add (deduct): Noncontrolling interests in Operating Partnership (14,267) (5,652) (16,212) Noncontrolling interests in discontinued operations 3,872 378 4,333 Real estate-related depreciation and amortization on continuing operations (a) 103,049 95,103 77,908 Real estate-related depreciation and amortization on discontinued operations 5,335 26,370 43,482 Property impairments on continuing operations 32,516 Property impairments on discontinued operations 94,811 13,467 Impairment of unconsolidated joint venture investment (included in Equity in earnings) (1) Discontinued operations: Gain on sale from unconsolidated joint ventures (7,677) 1,886 Continuing operations: Realized (gains) losses and unrealized (gains) losses on disposition of rental property, net (3,023) Discontinued operations: Realized (gains) losses and unrealized (gains) losses on disposition of rental property, net (2,411) (61,676) (25,552) Funds from operations available to common stock and Operating Partnership unitholders (b) (c) $ 20,829 $ 89,591 $ (22,754) (a) Includes the Company share from unconsolidated joint ventures, and adjustments for noncontrolling interests, of $10.3 million, $10.4 million and $10.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Excludes non-real estate-related depreciation and amortization of $1.0 million, $1.3 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. (b) Net loss available to common shareholders in 2023, 2022 and 2021 included $9.3 million, $9.4 million and $23.7 million, respectively, of land impairment charges and $46.3 million, $94.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, from a gain on disposition of developable land, which are included in the calculation to arrive at funds from operations as such gains and charges relate to non-depreciable assets. (c) Includes $49.8 million of interest cost related to the mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risk from its indebtedness primarily from changes in market interest rates. The Company monitors interest rate risk as an integral part of its overall risk management. The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing fixed rate indebtedness or by hedging the majority of its floating rate indebtedness with interest rate swaps or caps, as appropriate. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's indebtedness with an aggregate principal balance of $1.9 billion had an estimated aggregate fair value of $1.8 billion. Changes in interest rates, impact the fair value of the Company's fixed rate debt instruments, computed using current market yields. Approximately $1.6 billion of the Company long-term debt as of December 31, 2023 bears interest at fixed rates with a weighted average coupon of 4.29% and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. If market rates of interest increased or decreased by 100 basis points, the fair value of the Company fixed rate debt as of December 31, 2023 would be approximately $47.9 million higher or lower, respectively. The effective interest rates on the Company variable rate debt, which are hedged by interest-rate caps, as of December 31, 2023 ranged from SOFR plus 141.0 basis points to SOFR plus 275.0 basis points. Assuming interest-rate caps are not in effect as of December 31, 2023, if market rates of interest on the Company variable rate debt increased or decreased by 40 Table of Contents 100 basis points, then the increase or decrease in interest costs on the Company variable rate debt would be approximately $3.0 million annually. The following table summarizes the principal cash flows (in thousands) based upon maturity dates of the debt obligations and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. December 31, 2023 Debt, including current portion ($ in thousands) 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Sub-total Other (a) Total Fair Value Fixed Rate & Hedged Debt $ 314,076 $ 9,487 $ 546,138 $ 313,478 $ 348,392 $ 337,412 $ 1,868,983 $ (15,086) $ 1,853,897 $ 1,791,121 Average Interest Rate 3.43 % 3.67 % 4.44 % 3.66 % 6.01 % 3.98 % 4.34 % (a) Adjustment for unamortized debt discount/premium, net, unamortized deferred financing costs, net, and unamortized mark-to-market, net, as of December 31, 2023. While the Company has not experienced any significant credit losses, in a significant rising interest rate environment and/or economic downturn, tenant vacancies or defaults could increase and result in losses to the Company which could adversely affect its operating results and liquidity, including its ability to pay its debt obligations.
