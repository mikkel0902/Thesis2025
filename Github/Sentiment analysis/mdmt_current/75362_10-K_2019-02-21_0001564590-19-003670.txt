ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW: PACCAR is a global technology company whose Truck segment includes the design and manufacture of high-quality light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks. In North America, trucks are sold under the Kenworth and Peterbilt nameplates, in Europe, under the DAF nameplate and in Australia and South America, under the Kenworth and DAF nameplates. The Parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles. The Company Financial Services segment derives its earnings primarily from financing or leasing PACCAR products in North America, Europe and Australia. The Company Other business includes the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches. 2018 Financial Highlights Worldwide net sales and revenues were a record $23.50 billion in 2018 compared to $19.46 billion in 2017 due to record revenues in the Truck, Parts and Financial Services segments. Truck sales were $18.19 billion in 2018 compared to $14.77 billion in 2017 primarily due to higher truck deliveries in all of the Company primary markets. Parts sales were a record $3.84 billion in 2018 compared to $3.33 billion in 2017 reflecting higher demand in all markets. Financial Services revenues were $1.36 billion in 2018 compared to $1.27 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher average earning asset balances and higher interest rates. In 2018, PACCAR earned net income for the 80th consecutive year. Net income was a record $2.20 billion ($6.24 per diluted share) compared to $1.68 billion ($4.75 per diluted share) in 2017, which included a one-time net tax benefit of $173.4 million from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( the Tax Act ). Excluding this one-time net tax benefit, the Company earned adjusted net income (non-GAAP) of $1.50 billion ($4.26 per diluted share) in 2017. See Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 33-34. Capital investments were $437.1 million in 2018 compared to $433.1 million in 2017, reflecting additional investments in the Company manufacturing facilities, new product development and enhanced aftermarket support. After-tax return on beginning equity (ROE) was 27.3% in 2018 compared to 24.7% in 2017. Excluding the one-time net tax benefit, adjusted ROE (non-GAAP) was 22.2% in 2017. See Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 33-34. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $306.1 million in 2018 compared to $264.7 million in 2017. Peterbilt launched its new Model 579 UltraLoft in the first quarter of 2018, which offers customers a high-roof, integrated cab and sleeper that enhances driver comfort and operational efficiency. The UltraLoft dimensions represent an 18% increase in interior space giving drivers best-in-class living quarters. The Model 579 UltraLoft is an excellent tractor for long-haul routes, team driving and driver training. Kenworth introduced the W990 in the third quarter of 2018. This new conventional truck is designed to maximize performance in many customer applications including over-the-road and vocational. The Kenworth model W990 features the PACCAR MX-13 engine rated up to 510-hp and 1,850 lb-ft of torque, the 12-speed PACCAR automated transmission, PACCAR tandem rear axles, and the Kenworth TruckTech+ connected truck system. DAF highlighted its leadership in fuel efficiency and advanced powertrain technology by displaying a full range of innovative vehicles at the IAA truck show in Hannover, Germany. DAF showcased its CF Electric and LF Electric heavy- and medium-duty urban distribution vehicles. DAF also presented its CF Hybrid vehicle with the PACCAR MX-11 engine that delivers zero emissions in urban areas. PACCAR Parts continues to add global parts distribution capacity to deliver industry-leading availability and to support the growth of PACCAR MX engine parts sales and the global fleet service program. A new 160,000 square-foot distribution center in Toronto, Ontario, Canada opened in October 2018. 13 PACCAR has been honored as a global leader in environmental practices by environmen tal reporting firm CDP, earning recognition on the 2018 CDP Climate Change A List . Every year, over 6,000 companies disclose data about their environmental impacts, risks and opportunities to CDP for independent assessment. Reporting companies receive scor es of A to D- rating their effectiveness in tackling climate change and other environmental issues. PACCAR earned a CDP score of A , which places PACCAR in the top 2% of reporting companies. In January 2019, PACCAR displayed innovative electric and hydrogen fuel cell trucks at the CES 2019 show in Las Vegas, Nevada. CES is one of the world largest showcases for technological innovation. PACCAR exhibited three zero emission vehicles: a battery-electric Peterbilt Model 579EV; a battery-electric Peterbilt Model 220EV; and a hydrogen fuel cell electric Kenworth T680 developed in collaboration with Toyota. These trucks are designed for a range of customer applications, including over-the-road transportation, port operations and urban distribution. PACCAR was the only commercial vehicle manufacturer displaying trucks at CES. Truck Outlook Truck industry retail sales in the U.S. and Canada in 2019 are expected to increase to 285,000 to 315,000 units compared to 284,800 in 2018. In Europe, the 2019 truck industry registrations for over 16-tonne vehicles are expected to be 290,000 to 320,000 units compared to 318,800 in 2018. In South America, heavy-duty truck industry sales in 2019 are estimated to increase to 100,000 to 110,000 units compared to 88,500 units in 2018. Parts Outlook In 2019, PACCAR Parts sales are expected to grow 5-8% compared to 2018 sales. Financial Services Outlook Based on the truck market outlook, average earning assets in 2019 are expected to increase 3-5% compared to 2018. Current high levels of freight tonnage, freight rates and fleet utilization are contributing to customers profitability and cash flow. If current freight transportation conditions decline due to weaker economic conditions, then past due accounts, truck repossessions and credit losses would likely increase from the current low levels and new business volume would likely decline. Capital Spending and R&D Outlook Capital investments in 2019 are expected to be $525 to $575 million, and R&D is expected to be $320 to $350 million. The Company is investing for long-term growth in new truck models, integrated powertrains including zero emission electrification and hydrogen fuel cell technologies, enhanced aerodynamic truck designs, advanced driver assistance systems and truck connectivity, and expanded manufacturing and parts distribution facilities. See the Forward-Looking Statements section of Management Discussion and Analysis for factors that may affect these outlooks. 14 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: The Company results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are presented below.

The Company medium-duty market share was 17.7% in 2018 compared to 17.1% in 2017. 15 The over 16 tonne truck market in Europe in 2018 increased to 318,800 units from 306,100 units in 2017, and DAF market share was 16.6% in 2018 compared to 15.3% in 2017. The 6 to 16 tonne market in 2018 decreased to 51,900 units from 52,600 units in 2017. DAF market share in the 6 to 16-tonne market in 2018 was 9.0% com pared to 10.5% in 2017. The Company worldwide truck net sales and revenues are summarized below: ($ in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 % CHANGE Truck net sales and revenues: U.S. and Canada $ 11,357.0 $ 8,775.2 29 Europe 4,808.4 4,254.9 13 Mexico, South America, Australia and other 2,021.6 1,744.7 16 $ 18,187.0 $ 14,774.8 23 Truck income before income taxes $ 1,672.1 $ 1,253.8 33 Pre-tax return on revenues 9.2 % 8.5 % The Company worldwide truck net sales and revenues increased to $18.19 billion in 2018 from $14.77 billion in 2017, primarily reflecting higher truck deliveries in all of the Company primary markets. Truck segment income before income taxes and pre-tax return on revenues increased in 2018, reflecting the higher truck unit deliveries and higher gross margins. The major factors for the changes in net sales and revenues, cost of sales and revenues and gross margin between 2018 and 2017 for the Truck segment are as follows: NET COST OF SALES AND SALES AND GROSS ($ in millions) REVENUES REVENUES MARGIN 2017 $ 14,774.8 $ 13,111.1 $ 1,663.7 Increase (decrease) Truck delivery volume 2,955.7 2,458.9 496.8 Average truck sales prices 377.0 377.0 Average per truck material, labor and other direct costs 303.0 (303.0 ) Factory overhead and other indirect costs 109.7 (109.7 ) Extended warranties, operating leases and other (72.9 ) (76.5 ) 3.6 Currency translation 152.4 133.3 19.1 Total increase 3,412.2 2,928.4 483.8 2018 $ 18,187.0 $ 16,039.5 $ 2,147.5 Truck sales volume primarily reflects higher truck deliveries in the U.S. and Canada ($2,305.0 million sales and $1,890.7 million cost of sales) and Europe ($394.5 million sales and $333.0 million cost of sales). Average truck sales prices increased sales by $377.0 million, primarily due to higher price realization in North America and Europe. Average cost per truck increased cost of sales by $303.0 million, primarily reflecting higher material costs. Factory overhead and other indirect costs increased $109.7 million, primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses ($57.9 million) and higher supplies and maintenance costs ($47.5 million) to support increased truck production. Extended warranties, operating leases and other decreased revenues by $72.9 million and cost of sales by $76.5 million, primarily due to lower revenues and costs from operating leases. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenues and costs from service contracts. The currency translation effect on sales and cost of sales primarily reflects an increase in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Truck gross margins increased to 11.8% in 2018 from 11.3% in 2017, primarily due to the factors noted above. 16 Truck selling, gener al and administrative expenses (SG&A) for 2018 increased to $248.3 million from $216.0 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher professional fees ($20.1 million) and higher salaries and related expenses ($10.6 million). As a percentage of sales, Truck SG&A decreased to 1.4% in 2018 from 1.5% in 2017 due to higher net sales. Parts The Company Parts segment accounted for 16% of revenues in 2018 compared to 17% in 2017. ($ in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 % CHANGE Parts net sales and revenues: U.S. and Canada $ 2,545.1 $ 2,175.0 17 Europe 921.4 801.0 15 Mexico, South America, Australia and other 372.4 351.0 6 $ 3,838.9 $ 3,327.0 15 Parts income before income taxes $ 768.6 $ 610.0 26 Pre-tax return on revenues 20.0 % 18.3 % The Company worldwide parts net sales and revenues increased to a record $3.84 billion in 2018 from $3.33 billion in 2017, due to higher aftermarket demand and successful marketing programs in all markets. The increase in Parts segment income before income taxes and pre-tax return on revenues in 2018 was primarily due to higher sales volume. The major factors for the changes in net sales, cost of sales and gross margin between 2018 and 2017 for the Parts segment are as follows: NET COST GROSS ($ in millions) SALES OF SALES MARGIN 2017 $ 3,327.0 $ 2,445.8 $ 881.2 Increase (decrease) Aftermarket parts volume 369.8 224.7 145.1 Average aftermarket parts sales prices 107.5 107.5 Average aftermarket parts direct costs 83.2 (83.2 ) Warehouse and other indirect costs 18.4 (18.4 ) Currency translation 34.6 21.4 13.2 Total increase 511.9 347.7 164.2 2018 $ 3,838.9 $ 2,793.5 $ 1,045.4 Aftermarket parts sales volume increased by $369.8 million and related cost of sales increased by $224.7 million due to higher demand in all markets. Average aftermarket parts sales prices increased sales by $107.5 million, primarily due to higher price realization in the U.S. and Canada and Europe. Average aftermarket parts direct costs increased $83.2 million due to higher material costs. Warehouse and other indirect costs increased $18.4 million, primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses and higher maintenance costs. The currency translation effect on sales and cost of sales primarily reflects an increase in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Parts gross margins in 2018 increased to 27.2% from 26.5% in 2017 due to the factors noted above. Parts SG&A expense for 2018 was $206.2 million compared to $197.6 million in 2017 primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses and the effects of currency translation, partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs. As a percentage of sales, Parts SG&A was 5.4% in 2018, down from 5.9% in 2017, due to higher net sales. 17 Financial Services The Company Financial Services segment accounted for 6% of revenues in 2018 compared to 7% in 2017. ($ in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 % CHANGE New loan and lease volume: U.S. and Canada $ 3,076.7 $ 2,450.7 26 Europe 1,364.5 1,107.7 23 Mexico, Australia and other 792.1 769.7 3 $ 5,233.3 $ 4,328.1 21 New loan and lease volume by product: Loans and finance leases $ 4,177.3 $ 3,330.2 25 Equipment on operating lease 1,056.0 997.9 6 $ 5,233.3 $ 4,328.1 21 New loan and lease unit volume: Loans and finance leases 40,500 33,500 21 Equipment on operating lease 10,300 9,700 6 50,800 43,200 18 Average earning assets: U.S. and Canada $ 7,815.4 $ 7,351.9 6 Europe 3,364.9 2,937.7 15 Mexico, Australia and other 1,749.9 1,613.0 8 $ 12,930.2 $ 11,902.6 9 Average earning assets by product: Loans and finance leases $ 8,094.4 $ 7,407.5 9 Dealer wholesale financing 1,847.1 1,601.2 15 Equipment on lease and other 2,988.7 2,893.9 3 $ 12,930.2 $ 11,902.6 9 Revenues: U.S. and Canada $ 763.8 $ 734.0 4 Europe 352.6 306.8 15 Mexico, Australia and other 240.7 228.1 6 $ 1,357.1 $ 1,268.9 7 Revenues by product: Loans and finance leases $ 425.2 $ 375.2 13 Dealer wholesale financing 72.5 55.9 30 Equipment on lease and other 859.4 837.8 3 $ 1,357.1 $ 1,268.9 7 Income before income taxes $ 305.9 $ 261.7 17 New loan and lease volume was a record $5.23 billion in 2018 compared to $4.33 billion in 2017, primarily due to higher truck deliveries in 2018. PFS finance market share of new PACCAR truck sales was 23.9% in 2018 compared to 24.9% in 2017. PFS revenues increased to $1.36 billion in 2018 from $1.27 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to revenue on higher average earning assets and higher portfolio yields reflecting higher market interest rates in North America. The effects of currency translation increased PFS revenues by $10.9 million in 2018. PFS income before income taxes increased to $305.9 million in 2018 from $261.7 million in 2017, primarily due to higher average earning asset balances and higher results on returned lease assets. 18 Included in Financial Services Other Assets on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets are used trucks held for sale, net of impairments, of $226.4 million at December 31, 2018 and $221.7 million at December 31, 2017. These trucks are primarily units returned from matured operating leases in the ordinary course of business, and also include trucks acquired from repossessions or through acquisitions of used trucks in trades related to new truck sales. The Company recognized losses on used trucks, excluding repossessions, of $35.4 million in 2018 compared to $45.1 million in 2017, including losses on multiple unit transactions of $20.2 million in 2018 compared to $29.2 million in 2017. Used truck losses related to repossessions, which are recognized as credit losses, were $.9 million and $5.1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The major factors for the changes in interest and fees, interest and other borrowing expenses and finance margin between 2018 and 2017 are outlined below: ($ in millions) INTEREST AND FEES INTEREST AND OTHER BORROWING EXPENSES FINANCE MARGIN 2017 $ 431.1 $ 149.6 $ 281.5 Increase (decrease) Average finance receivables 45.1 45.1 Average debt balances 13.5 (13.5 ) Yields 21.0 21.0 Borrowing rates 23.9 (23.9 ) Currency translation and other .5 (.1 ) .6 Total increase 66.6 37.3 29.3 2018 $ 497.7 $ 186.9 $ 310.8 Average finance receivables increased $845.3 million (excluding foreign exchange effects) in 2018 as a result of retail portfolio new business volume exceeding collections and higher dealer wholesale balances. Average debt balances increased $666.7 million (excluding foreign exchange effects) in 2018. The higher average debt balances reflect funding for a higher average earning assets portfolio, which includes loans, finance leases, wholesale and equipment on operating lease. Higher portfolio yields (5.0% in 2018 compared to 4.8% in 2017) increased interest and fees by $21.0 million. The higher portfolio yields were primarily due to higher market rates in North America. Higher borrowing rates (2.0% in 2018 compared to 1.7% in 2017) were primarily due to higher debt market rates in North America. The following table summarizes operating lease, rental and other revenues and depreciation and other expenses: ($ in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Operating lease and rental revenues $ 826.0 $ 784.6 Used truck sales and other 33.4 53.2 Operating lease, rental and other revenues $ 859.4 $ 837.8 Depreciation of operating lease equipment $ 588.2 $ 587.4 Vehicle operating expenses 121.5 99.6 Cost of used truck sales and other 18.3 40.5 Depreciation and other expenses $ 728.0 $ 727.5 19 The major factors for the changes in operating lease, rental and other revenues, depreciation and other expenses and lease margin between 2018 and 2017 are outlined below: ($ in millions) OPERATING LEASE, RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES DEPRECIATION AND OTHER EXPENSES LEASE MARGIN 2017 $ 837.8 $ 727.5 $ 110.3 (Decrease) increase Used truck sales (20.5 ) (21.9 ) 1.4 Results on returned lease assets (11.5 ) 11.5 Average operating lease assets 15.7 12.6 3.1 Revenue and cost per asset 16.0 12.0 4.0 Currency translation and other 10.4 9.3 1.1 Total increase 21.6 .5 21.1 2018 $ 859.4 $ 728.0 $ 131.4 A lower sales volume of used trucks received on trade decreased operating lease, rental and other revenues by $20.5 million and decreased depreciation and other expenses by $21.9 million. Results on returned lease assets decreased depreciation and other expenses by $11.5 million, primarily due to lower losses on sales of returned lease units. Average operating lease assets increased $49.4 million (excluding foreign exchange effects), which increased revenues by $15.7 million and related depreciation and other expenses by $12.6 million. Revenue per asset increased $16.0 million primarily due to higher rental utilization. Cost per asset increased $12.0 million due to higher depreciation expense and vehicle operating expenses. The currency translation effects reflect an increase in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, partially offset by the Mexican peso. The following table summarizes the provision for losses on receivables and net charge-offs: 2018 2017 ($ in millions) PROVISION FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES NET CHARGE-OFFS PROVISION FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES NET CHARGE-OFFS U.S. and Canada $ 10.4 $ 6.9 $ 13.7 $ 14.5 Europe (.8 ) 5.9 1.4 1.4 Mexico, Australia and other 6.9 4.4 7.2 5.5 $ 16.5 $ 17.2 $ 22.3 $ 21.4 The provision for losses on receivables was $16.5 million in 2018 compared to $22.3 million in 2017, reflecting continued good portfolio performance. The lower provision for losses on receivables in Europe primarily reflects higher recoveries on charged-off accounts. The Company modifies loans and finance leases as a normal part of its Financial Services operations. The Company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. Modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. Insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. Modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. The Company modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. When considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the Company considers likely to perform under the modified terms. When the Company modifies a loan or finance lease for credit reasons and grants a concession, the modification is classified as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). 20 The post-modification balance of accounts modified during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are summarized below: 2018 2017 ($ in millions) RECORDED INVESTMENT % OF TOTAL PORTFOLIO* RECORDED INVESTMENT % OF TOTAL PORTFOLIO* Commercial $ 213.6 2.5 % $ 189.7 2.4 % Insignificant delay 50.3 .6 % 78.9 1.0 % Credit - no concession 52.2 .6 % 58.2 .8 % Credit - TDR 13.1 .2 % 20.5 .3 % $ 329.2 3.9 % $ 347.3 4.5 % * Recorded investment immediately after modification as a percentage of the year-end retail portfolio balance. In 2018, total modification activity decreased compared to 2017, reflecting lower modifications for insignificant delays, credit no concession and credit - TDRs, partially offset by higher commercial modifications. The increase in modifications for commercial reasons primarily reflects higher volumes of refinancing. The decrease in modifications for insignificant delay reflects fewer fleet customers requesting payment relief for up to three months. The decrease in modifications for credit - no concession is primarily due to lower volumes of refinancing for customers in financial difficulty. Credit - TDR modifications decreased to $13.1 million in 2018 from $20.5 million in 2017 mainly due to the contract modifications for two fleet customers in 2017. The following table summarizes the Company 30+ days past due accounts: At December 31, 2018 2017 Percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due: U.S. and Canada .1 % .4 % Europe .5 % .3 % Mexico, Australia and other 1.6 % 1.5 % Worldwide .4 % .5 % Accounts 30+ days past due were .4% at December 31, 2018 and .5% at December 31, 2017. Lower past dues in the U.S. and Canada were partially offset by higher past dues in Europe and Mexico. The Company continues to focus on maintaining low past due balances. When the Company modifies a 30+ days past due account, the customer is then generally considered current under the revised contractual terms. The Company modified $7.2 million and $.6 million of accounts worldwide during the fourth quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively, which were 30+ days past due and became current at the time of modification. Had these accounts not been modified and continued to not make payments, the pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due would have been as follows: At December 31, 2018 2017 Pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due: U.S. and Canada .2 % .4 % Europe .5 % .3 % Mexico, Australia and other 1.8 % 1.5 % Worldwide .5 % .5 % Modifications of accounts in prior quarters that were more than 30 days past due at the time of modification are included in past dues if they were not performing under the modified terms at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The effect on the allowance for credit losses from such modifications was not significant at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Company 2018 and 2017 annualized pre-tax return on average assets for Financial Services was 2.2% and 2.1%, respectively. 21 Other Other includes the winch business as well as sales, income and expenses not attributable to a reportable segment. Other also includes non-service cost components of pension (income) expense and a portion of corporate expense. Other sales represent less than 1% of consolidated net sales and revenues for 2018 and 2017. Other SG&A was $70.4 million in 2018 and $50.4 million in 2017. The increase in Other SG&A was primarily due to higher compensation costs. Other income before tax decreased to $2.7 million in 2018 from $12.5 million in 2017 primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses, partially offset by improved results in the winch business. Investment income increased to $60.9 million in 2018 from $35.3 million in 2017, primarily due to higher average portfolio balances and higher yields on U.S. investments due to higher market interest rates. Income Taxes In 2018, the effective tax rate was 21.9% compared to 22.9% in 2017, reflecting the reduced federal tax rate of 21% enacted on December 22, 2017. The Company effective tax rate for 2018 was impacted by a one-time reduction in tax liability related to extended warranty contracts and higher realized R&D tax credits.

Domestic and foreign pre-tax return on revenues increased primarily due to the improved truck and parts results. 2017 Compared to 2016: Truck The Company Truck segment accounted for 76% of revenues in 2017 compared to 75% in 2016. The Company new truck deliveries are summarized below: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % CHANGE U.S. and Canada 84,200 71,500 18 Europe 57,100 53,000 8 Mexico, South America, Australia and other 17,600 16,400 7 Total units 158,900 140,900 13 In 2017, industry retail sales in the heavy-duty market in the U.S. and Canada increased to 218,400 units from 215,700 units in 2016. The Company heavy-duty truck retail market share increased to 30.7% in 2017 from 28.5% in 2016. The medium-duty market was 81,900 units in 2017 compared to 85,500 units in 2016. The Company medium-duty market share was 17.1% in 2017 compared to 16.2% in 2016. The over 16 tonne truck market in Europe in 2017 increased to 306,100 units from 302,500 units in 2016, and DAF market share decreased to 15.3% in 2017 from 15.5% in 2016. The 6 to 16 tonne market in 2017 decreased to 52,600 units from 52,900 units in 2016. DAF market share in the 6 to 16-tonne market in 2017 increased to 10.5% from 10.1% in 2016. 22 The Company worldwide truck net sales and revenues are summarized below: ($ in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % CHANGE Truck net sales and revenues: U.S. and Canada $ 8,775.2 $ 7,363.5 19 Europe 4,254.9 3,863.0 10 Mexico, South America, Australia and other 1,744.7 1,540.8 13 $ 14,774.8 $ 12,767.3 16 Truck income before income taxes $ 1,253.8 $ 1,107.4 13 Pre-tax return on revenues 8.5 % 8.7 % The Company worldwide truck net sales and revenues increased to $14.77 billion in 2017 from $12.77 billion in 2016, primarily reflecting higher truck deliveries in the U.S. and Canada, Europe and Australia. Truck segment income before income taxes in 2017 reflects higher truck deliveries, while pre-tax return on revenues decreased at the higher volumes due to a lower gross margin percentage. The major factors for the changes in net sales and revenues, cost of sales and revenues and gross margin between 2017 and 2016 for the Truck segment are as follows: NET COST OF SALES AND SALES AND GROSS ($ in millions) REVENUES REVENUES MARGIN 2016 $ 12,767.3 $ 11,272.0 $ 1,495.3 Increase (decrease) Truck delivery volume 1,841.9 1,559.7 282.2 Average truck sales prices 121.6 121.6 Average per truck material, labor and other direct costs 102.7 (102.7 ) Factory overhead and other indirect costs 97.8 (97.8 ) Operating leases (28.1 ) (25.2 ) (2.9 ) Currency translation 72.1 104.1 (32.0 ) Total increase 2,007.5 1,839.1 168.4 2017 $ 14,774.8 $ 13,111.1 $ 1,663.7 Truck delivery volume, which resulted in higher sales and cost of sales, primarily reflects higher truck deliveries in the U.S. and Canada ($1,309.0 million sales and $1,104.3 million cost of sales) and Europe ($370.4 million sales and $312.2 million cost of sales). Average truck sales prices increased sales by $121.6 million, primarily due to higher price realization in Europe ($66.7 million) and the U.S. and Canada ($66.2 million), partially offset by lower price realization in Mexico ($12.5 million). Average cost per truck increased cost of sales by $102.7 million, reflecting higher material costs. Factory overhead and other indirect costs increased $97.8 million, primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses ($55.1 million), higher maintenance costs ($27.8 million) as well as higher depreciation expense ($12.7 million). Operating lease revenues decreased by $28.1 million and cost of sales decreased by $25.2 million, reflecting higher revenues deferred and lower revenues recognized. The currency translation effect on sales primarily reflects an increase in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a weaker British pound. The currency effect on cost of sales primarily reflects the stronger euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Truck gross margins decreased to 11.3% in 2017 from 11.7% in 2016 primarily due to the factors noted above. Truck selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) for 2017 increased to $216.0 million from $205.7 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher professional fees and salaries and related expenses, partially offset by lower sales and marketing expenses. As a percentage of sales, Truck SG&A decreased to 1.5% in 2017 from 1.6% in 2016 due to higher net sales. 23 Parts The Company Parts segment accounted for 17% of revenues in 2017 compared to 18% in 2016.

The increase in Parts segment income before income taxes and pre-tax return on revenues in 2017 was primarily due to higher sales volume. The major factors for the changes in net sales, cost of sales and gross margin between 2017 and 2016 for the Parts segment are as follows: NET COST GROSS ($ in millions) SALES OF SALES MARGIN 2016 $ 3,005.7 $ 2,196.4 $ 809.3 Increase (decrease) Aftermarket parts volume 270.0 183.6 86.4 Average aftermarket parts sales prices 45.9 45.9 Average aftermarket parts direct costs 37.5 (37.5 ) Warehouse and other indirect costs 18.0 (18.0 ) Currency translation 5.4 10.3 (4.9 ) Total increase 321.3 249.4 71.9 2017 $ 3,327.0 $ 2,445.8 $ 881.2 Aftermarket parts sales volume increased by $270.0 million and related cost of sales increased by $183.6 million due to higher demand in all markets. Average aftermarket parts sales prices increased sales by $45.9 million, reflecting higher price realization in the U.S. and Canada and Europe. Average aftermarket parts direct costs increased $37.5 million due to higher material costs. Warehouse and other indirect costs increased $18.0 million, primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses to support the higher sales volume. The currency translation effect on sales primarily reflects an increase in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a weaker British pound. The currency effect on cost of sales primarily reflects the stronger euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Parts gross margins in 2017 decreased to 26.5% from 26.9% in 2016 due to the factors noted above. Parts SG&A expense for 2017 was $197.6 million compared to $192.7 million in 2016 primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses. As a percentage of sales, Parts SG&A was 5.9% in 2017, down from 6.4% in 2016, due to higher net sales. 24 Financial Services The Company Financial Services segment accounted for 7% of revenues in 2017 and 2016.

PFS finance market share on new PACCAR truck sales was 24.9% in 2017 compared to 26.7% in 2016. PFS revenues increased to $1.27 billion in 2017 from $1.19 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher average operating lease earning assets, and higher used truck sales, partially offset by unfavorable effects of currency translation, which decreased PFS revenues by $.6 million in 2017. PFS income before income taxes decreased to $261.7 million in 2017 from $305.7 million in 2016, primarily due to lower results on returned lease assets, higher borrowing rates, a higher provision for losses on receivables, and the effects of translating weaker foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher average earning asset balances. The currency exchange impact decreased PFS income before income taxes by $1.2 million in 2017. 25 Included in Financial Services Other Assets on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets are used trucks held for sale, net of impairments, of $221.7 million at December 31, 2017 and $267.2 million at December 31, 2016. These trucks are primarily units returned from matured operating leases in the ordinary course of business, and also includes trucks acquired from repossessions or through acquisitions of used trucks in trades related to new truck sales. The Company recognized losses on used trucks, excluding repossessions, of $45.1 million in 2017 compared to $16.4 million in 2016, including losses on multiple unit transactions of $29.2 million in 2017 compared to $6.8 million in 2016. Used truck losses related to repossessions, which are recognized as credit losses, were $5.1 million and $3.4 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The major factors for the changes in interest and fees, interest and other borrowing expenses and finance margin between 2017 and 2016 are outlined below: ($ in millions) INTEREST AND FEES INTEREST AND OTHER BORROWING EXPENSES FINANCE MARGIN 2016 $ 426.2 $ 127.2 $ 299.0 Increase (decrease) Average finance receivables 2.3 2.3 Average debt balances 2.4 (2.4 ) Yields 5.3 5.3 Borrowing rates 21.0 (21.0 ) Currency translation (2.7 ) (1.0 ) (1.7 ) Total increase (decrease) 4.9 22.4 (17.5 ) 2017 $ 431.1 $ 149.6 $ 281.5 Average finance receivables increased $89.1 million (excluding foreign exchange effects) in 2017 as a result of retail portfolio new business volume exceeding collections. Average debt balances increased $130.6 million (excluding foreign exchange effects) in 2017. The higher average debt balances reflect funding for a higher average earning assets portfolio, which includes loans, finance leases, wholesale and equipment on operating lease. Higher portfolio yields (4.81% in 2017 compared to 4.77% in 2016) increased interest and fees by $5.3 million. The higher portfolio yields reflect higher lending volumes in North America which have higher market rates than Europe. Higher borrowing rates (1.7% in 2017 compared to 1.5% in 2016) were primarily due to higher debt market rates in North America, partially offset by lower debt market rates in Europe. The currency translation effects reflect a decline in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Mexican peso and the British pound, partially offset by a strengthening euro. The following table summarizes operating lease, rental and other revenues and depreciation and other expenses: ($ in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Operating lease and rental revenues $ 784.6 $ 720.5 Used truck sales and other 53.2 40.0 Operating lease, rental and other revenues $ 837.8 $ 760.5 Depreciation of operating lease equipment $ 587.4 $ 509.1 Vehicle operating expenses 99.6 92.1 Cost of used truck sales and other 40.5 34.0 Depreciation and other expenses $ 727.5 $ 635.2 26 The major factors for the changes in operating lease, rental and other revenues, depreciation and other expenses and lease margin between 2017 and 2016 are outlined below: ($ in millions) OPERATING LEASE, RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES DEPRECIATION AND OTHER EXPENSES LEASE MARGIN 2016 $ 760.5 $ 635.2 $ 125.3 Increase (decrease) Used truck sales 9.7 8.5 1.2 Results on returned lease assets 31.0 (31.0 ) Average operating lease assets 56.5 47.9 8.6 Revenue and cost per asset 5.5 5.1 .4 Currency translation and other 5.6 (.2 ) 5.8 Total increase (decrease) 77.3 92.3 (15.0 ) 2017 $ 837.8 $ 727.5 $ 110.3 A higher volume of used truck sales increased operating lease, rental and other revenues by $9.7 million and increased depreciation and other expenses by $8.5 million. Results on returned lease assets increased depreciation and other expenses by $31.0 million, primarily due to higher losses on sales of returned lease units. Average operating lease assets increased $223.8 million (excluding foreign exchange effects), which increased revenues by $56.5 million and related depreciation and other expenses by $47.9 million. Revenue per asset increased $5.5 million primarily due to higher rental income. Cost per asset increased $5.1 million due to higher depreciation expense, partially offset by lower vehicle operating expenses. The currency translation effects reflect an increase in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, partially offset by a weakening of the British pound. The following table summarizes the provision for losses on receivables and net charge-offs: 2017 2016 ($ in millions) PROVISION FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES NET CHARGE-OFFS PROVISION FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES NET CHARGE-OFFS U.S. and Canada $ 13.7 $ 14.5 $ 14.0 $ 14.7 Europe 1.4 1.4 .4 1.2 Mexico, Australia and other 7.2 5.5 4.0 3.3 $ 22.3 $ 21.4 $ 18.4 $ 19.2 The provision for losses on receivables was $22.3 million in 2017, an increase of $3.9 million compared to 2016, reflecting higher portfolio balances in Mexico, Australia and other and Europe. The Company modifies loans and finance leases as a normal part of its Financial Services operations. The Company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. Modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. Insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. Modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. The Company modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. When considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the Company considers likely to perform under the modified terms. When the Company modifies a loan or finance lease for credit reasons and grants a concession, the modification is classified as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). 27 The post-modification balance of accounts modifi ed during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized below: 2017 2016 ($ in millions) RECORDED INVESTMENT % OF TOTAL PORTFOLIO* RECORDED INVESTMENT % OF TOTAL PORTFOLIO* Commercial $ 189.7 2.4 % $ 236.2 3.2 % Insignificant delay 78.9 1.0 % 90.3 1.3 % Credit - no concession 58.2 .8 % 51.9 .7 % Credit - TDR 20.5 .3 % 31.6 .4 % $ 347.3 4.5 % $ 410.0 5.6 % * Recorded investment immediately after modification as a percentage of the year-end retail portfolio balance. In 2017, total modification activity decreased compared to 2016, reflecting lower volumes of refinancing for commercial reasons, primarily in the U.S. The decrease in modifications for insignificant delay reflects fewer fleet customers requesting payment relief for up to three months. Credit - TDR modifications decreased to $20.5 million in 2017 from $31.6 million in 2016 mainly due to the contract modifications for two fleet customers in 2016. The following table summarizes the Company 30+ days past due accounts: At December 31, 2017 2016 Percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due: U.S. and Canada .4 % .3 % Europe .3 % .5 % Mexico, Australia and other 1.5 % 1.8 % Worldwide .5 % .5 % Accounts 30+ days past due were .5% at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, reflecting lower past dues in Europe as well as Mexico, Australia and other, offset by an increase in the U.S. and Canada. The Company continues to focus on maintaining low past due balances. When the Company modifies a 30+ days past due account, the customer is then generally considered current under the revised contractual terms. The Company modified $.6 million and $2.6 million of accounts worldwide during the fourth quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively, which were 30+ days past due and became current at the time of modification. Had these accounts not been modified and continued to not make payments, the pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due would have been as follows: At December 31, 2017 2016 Pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due: U.S. and Canada .4 % .3 % Europe .3 % .5 % Mexico, Australia and other 1.5 % 2.0 % Worldwide .5 % .6 % Modifications of accounts in prior quarters that were more than 30 days past due at the time of modification are included in past dues if they were not performing under the modified terms at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The effect on the allowance for credit losses from such modifications was not significant at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Company 2017 and 2016 annualized pre-tax return on average assets for Financial Services was 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively. The decrease was due primarily to higher losses on used trucks in 2017. 28 Other Other includes the winch business as well as sales, income and expenses not attributable to a reportable segment. Other also includes the EC charge, non-service cost components of pension (income) expense and a portion of corporate expense. Other sales represent less than 1% of consolidated net sales and revenues for 2017 and 2016. Other SG&A was $50.4 million in 2017 and $44.2 million in 2016. The increase in Other SG&A was primarily due to higher labor related costs. Other income (loss) before tax was an income of $12.5 million in 2017 compared to a loss of $852.4 million in 2016, which included the impact of the $833.0 million EC charge. Investment income increased to $35.3 million in 2017 from $27.6 million in 2016, primarily due to higher average U.S. portfolio balances and higher yields on U.S. investments due to higher market interest rates. Income Taxes In 2017, the effective tax rate was 22.9% compared to 53.8% in 2016. The lower rate is due to the 2017 one-time impact from the change in U.S. tax law as explained below and the unfavorable 2016 impact of the one-time non-deductible expense of $833.0 million for the EC charge. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted new federal income tax legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( the Tax Act ). The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed a one-time transition tax on the Company foreign earnings, which previously had been deferred from U.S. income tax and created a modified territorial system. As a result, the Company recorded a provisional amount of $304.0 million of deferred tax benefits, due to the re-measurement of net deferred tax liabilities at the new lower statutory tax rate. In addition, the Company recorded a provisional amount of $130.6 million of tax expense on the Company foreign earnings, which previously had been deferred from U.S. income tax. ($ in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Domestic income before taxes $ 1,347.8 $ 1,190.7 Foreign income (loss) before taxes 825.5 (60.3 ) Total income before taxes $ 2,173.3 $ 1,130.4 Domestic pre-tax return on revenues 12.8 % 12.8 % Foreign pre-tax return on revenues 9.2 % (.8 )% Total pre-tax return on revenues 11.2 % 6.6 % In 2017, the improvement in domestic income before taxes was due to higher truck deliveries and improved aftermarket demand. Foreign income (loss) before taxes improved due to stronger truck and aftermarket demand as well as the 2016 impact of the $833.0 million EC charge.

Higher operating cash flows reflect higher net income of $2.20 billion in 2018 compared to $1.68 billion in 2017, which includes a net deferred tax benefit of $173.9 million primarily due to the 2017 Tax Act. Additionally, there were higher cash inflows of $195.3 million from accounts payable and accrued expenses as purchases of goods and services exceeded payments. The higher cash inflows were offset by a higher increase in Financial Services segment wholesale receivables of $240.3 million and a higher increase in net purchases of inventory of $182.8 million. In addition, the higher cash inflows were offset by an increase of $98.9 million in sales-type finance leases and dealer direct loans, whereby originations exceeded cash receipts in 2018 ($27.0 million) compared to cash receipts exceeding origination in 2017 ($71.9 million). The higher cash inflows were also offset by a net change in derivatives of $82.5 million which was mainly related to the settlement of matured interest rate contracts. Investing activities : Cash used in investing activities decreased by $33.9 million to $1.93 billion in 2018 from $1.96 billion in 2017. Lower net cash used in investing activities reflects a $506.4 million increase from marketable debt securities, as there were $315.6 million in net proceeds from sales of marketable debt securities in 2018 compared to $190.8 million in net purchases of marketable debt securities in 2017. In addition, there were higher proceeds from asset disposals of $183.0 million. The inflows were partially offset by higher net originations from retail loans and direct financing leases of $541.8 million, higher cash used in the acquisition of equipment on operating leases of $71.5 million, and higher payments for property, plant and equipment of $34.2 million. Financing activities : Cash provided by financing activities was $71.1 million in 2018 compared to cash used in financing activities of $393.8 million in 2017. In 2018, the Company issued $2.34 billion of term debt, repaid term debt of $1.76 billion and increased its outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank loans by $625.9 million. In 2017, the Company issued $1.67 billion of term debt, repaid term debt of $1.90 billion and increased its outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank loans by $352.1 million. This resulted in cash provided by borrowing activities of $1.21 billion in 2018, $1.09 billion higher than the cash provided by borrowing activities of $125.2 million in 2017. The company paid $804.3 million in dividends in 2018 compared to $558.3 million in 2017; the increase of $246.0 million was primarily due to a special dividend paid in January 2018 that was higher than the special dividend paid in January 2017. In 2018, the Company also repurchased 5.8 million shares of common stock for $354.4 million. There were no stock repurchases in 2017. 2017 Compared to 2016: Operating activities : Cash provided by operations increased by $415.0 million to $2.72 billion in 2017. Higher operating cash flows reflect higher net income of $1.68 billion in 2017, compared to net income of $521.7 million in 2016, which includes payment of the $833.0 million EC charge. In addition, there were higher cash inflows of $342.2 million from accounts payable and accrued expenses as purchases of goods and services exceeded payments. The higher cash inflows were offset by wholesale receivables on new trucks of $673.6 million as originations exceeded cash receipts in 2017 ($272.0 million) compared to cash receipts exceeding originations in 2016 ($401.6 million). Additionally, there was a higher cash usage of $214.0 million from inventory due to $149.9 million in net inventory purchases in 2017 versus $64.1 million in net inventory reductions in 2016. Finally, there was a higher cash outflow for payment of income taxes of $160.0 million. 30 Investing activities : Cash used in investing activitie s increased by $400.3 million to $1.96 billion in 2017 from $1.56 billion in 2016. Higher net cash used in investing activities reflects $463.7 million in marketable debt securities as there was $190.8 million in net purchases of marketable debt securities in 2017 compared to $272.9 million in net proceeds from sales of marketable debt securities in 2016. In addition, there were higher net originations of retail loans and direct financing leases of $87.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The outflows were p artially offset by lower cash used in the acquisitions of equipment for operating leases of $166.5 million. Financing activities : Cash used in financing activities was $393.8 million in 2017 compared to cash used in financing activities of $823.5 million in 2016. The Company paid $558.3 million in dividends in 2017 compared to $829.3 million in 2016; the decrease of $271.0 million was primarily due to a lower special dividend paid in January 2017 than the special dividend paid in January 2016. In 2016, the Company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $70.5 million, while there were no stock repurchases in 2017. In 2017, the Company issued $1.67 billion of term debt, increased its outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank loans by $352.1 million and repaid term debt of $1.90 billion. In 2016, the Company issued $1.99 billion of term debt, repaid term debt of $1.63 billion and reduced its outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank loans by $322.8 million. This resulted in cash provided by borrowing activities of $125.2 million in 2017, $78.3 million higher than the cash provided by borrowing activities of $46.9 million in 2016. Credit Lines and Other: The Company has line of credit arrangements of $3.50 billion, of which $3.27 billion were unused at December 31, 2018. Included in these arrangements are $3.00 billion of syndicated bank facilities, of which $1.00 billion expires in June 2019, $1.00 billion expires in June 2022 and $1.00 billion expires in June 2023. The Company intends to replace these credit facilities on or before expiration with facilities of similar amounts and duration. These credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for commercial paper borrowings and maturing medium-term notes. There were no borrowings under the syndicated bank facilities for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of June 30, 2018, the Company completed the repurchase of $300.0 million of the Company common stock under the authorization approved in September 2015. On July 9, 2018, PACCAR Board of Directors approved another plan to repurchase up to $300.0 million of the Company outstanding common stock. As of December 31, 2018, $260.1 million of shares have been repurchased under this plan. On December 4, 2018, the Company Board of Directors approved a plan to repurchase an additional $500.0 million of PACCAR outstanding common stock upon completion of the prior plan. Truck, Parts and Other The Company provides funding for working capital, capital expenditures, R&D, dividends, stock repurchases and other business initiatives and commitments primarily from cash provided by operations. Management expects this method of funding to continue in the future. Over the past decade, the Company combined investments in worldwide capital projects and R&D totaled $6.04 billion, and have significantly increased the operating capacity and efficiency of its facilities and enhanced the quality and operating efficiency of the Company premium products. Capital investments in 2019 are expected to be $525 to $575 million, and R&D is expected to be $320 to $350 million. The Company is investing for long-term growth in new truck models, integrated powertrains including zero emission electrification and hydrogen fuel cell technologies, enhanced aerodynamic truck designs, advanced driver assistance systems and truck connectivity, and expanded manufacturing and parts distribution facilities. The Company conducts business in certain countries which have been experiencing or may experience significant financial stress, fiscal or political strain and are subject to the corresponding potential for default. The Company routinely monitors its financial exposure to global financial conditions, global counterparties and operating environments. As of December 31, 2018, the Company exposures in such countries were insignificant. Financial Services The Company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets. The primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and medium-term notes issued in the public markets and, to a lesser extent, bank loans. An additional source of funds is loans from other PACCAR companies. 31 The Company issues commercia l paper for a portion of its funding in its Financial Services segment. Some of this commercial paper is converted to fixed interest rate debt through the use of interest-rate swaps, which are used to manage interest-rate risk. In November 2018, the Company U.S. finance subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Corp. (PFC), filed a shelf registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for PFC as of December 31, 2018 was $4.90 billion. The registration expires in November 2021 and does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued during that period. As of December 31, 2018, the Company European finance subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Europe, had 1.35 billion available for issuance under a 2.50 billion medium-term note program listed on the Professional Securities Market of the London Stock Exchange. This program replaced an expiring program in the second quarter of 2018 and is renewable annually through the filing of new listing particulars. In April 2016, PACCAR Financial Mexico registered a 10.00 billion peso medium-term note and commercial paper program with the Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores. The registration expires in April 2021 and limits the amount of commercial paper (up to one year) to 5.00 billion pesos. At December 31, 2018, 7.75 billion pesos were available for issuance. In August 2018, the Company Australian subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Pty. Ltd. (PFPL), registered a medium-term note program. The program does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued under the program. The total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for PFPL as of December 31, 2018 was 150.0 million Australian dollars. In the event of a future significant disruption in the financial markets, the Company may not be able to issue replacement commercial paper. As a result, the Company is exposed to liquidity risk from the shorter maturity of short-term borrowings paid to lenders compared to the longer timing of receivable collections from customers. The Company believes its cash balances and investments, collections on existing finance receivables, syndicated bank lines and current investment-grade credit ratings of A+/A1 will continue to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates and therefore contribute to the Company maintaining its liquidity and financial stability. A decrease in these credit ratings could negatively impact the Company ability to access capital markets at competitive interest rates and the Company ability to maintain liquidity and financial stability. PACCAR believes its Financial Services companies will be able to continue funding receivables, servicing debt and paying dividends through internally generated funds, access to public and private debt markets and lines of credit. Commitments The following summarizes the Company contractual cash commitments at December 31, 2018: MATURITY ($ in millions) WITHIN 1 YEAR 1-3 YEARS 3-5 YEARS MORE THAN 5 YEARS TOTAL Borrowings* $ 5,076.8 $ 4,118.2 $ 774.8 $ 9,969.8 Purchase obligations 81.3 126.6 58.0 265.9 Interest on debt** 135.1 157.7 28.5 321.3 Operating leases 18.2 23.1 8.0 $ 1.2 50.5 Other obligations 51.7 9.8 1.4 62.9 $ 5,363.1 $ 4,435.4 $ 870.7 $ 1.2 $ 10,670.4 * Commercial paper included in borrowings is at par value. ** Interest on floating-rate debt is based on the applicable market rates at December 31, 2018. Total cash commitments for borrowings and interest on term debt are $10.29 billion and were related to the Financial Services segment. As described in Note J of the consolidated financial statements, borrowings consist primarily of term notes and commercial paper issued by the Financial Services segment. The Company expects to fund its maturing Financial Services debt obligations principally from funds provided by collections from customers on loans and lease contracts, as well as from the proceeds of commercial paper and medium-term note borrowings. Purchase obligations are the Company contractual commitments to acquire future production inventory and capital equipment. Other obligations include deferred cash compensation. 32 The Company other commitments include the following at December 31, 2018: COMMITMENT EXPIRATION ($ in millions) WITHIN 1 YEAR 1-3 YEARS 3-5 YEARS MORE THAN 5 YEARS TOTAL Loan and lease commitments $ 1,122.3 $ 1,122.3 Residual value guarantees 356.9 $ 504.9 $ 356.4 $ 78.8 1,297.0 Letters of credit 10.9 .1 .1 2.9 14.0 $ 1,490.1 $ 505.0 $ 356.5 $ 81.7 $ 2,433.3 Loan and lease commitments are for funding new retail loan and lease contracts. Residual value guarantees represent the Company commitment to acquire trucks at a guaranteed value if the customer decides to return the truck at a specified date in the future. RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES: This Form 10-K includes adjusted net income (non-GAAP) and adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP) , which are financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), since they exclude the one-time tax benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( the Tax Act ) in 2017 and the non-recurring European Commission charge in 2016. These measures differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, the Form 10-K includes the financial ratios noted below calculated based on non-GAAP measures. Management utilizes these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company performance and believes these measures allow investors and management to evaluate operating trends by excluding significant non-recurring items that are not representative of underlying operating trends. Reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP measures of adjusted net income (non-GAAP) and adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP) are as follows: ($ in millions, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Net income $ 1,675.2 $ 521.7 One-time tax benefit from the Tax Act (173.4 ) Non-recurring European Commission charge 833.0 Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) $ 1,501.8 $ 1,354.7 Per diluted share: Net income $ 4.75 $ 1.48 One-time tax benefit from the Tax Act (.49 ) Non-recurring European Commission charge 2.37 Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) $ 4.26 $ 3.85 After-tax return on revenues 8.6 % 3.1 % One-time tax benefit from the Tax Act (.9 )% Non-recurring European Commission charge 4.9 % After-tax adjusted return on revenues (non-GAAP) * 7.7 % 8.0 % After-tax return on beginning equity 24.7 % 7.5 % One-time tax benefit from the Tax Act (2.5 )% Non-recurring European Commission charge 12.0 % After-tax adjusted return on beginning equity (non-GAAP) * 22.2 % 19.5 % * Calculated using adjusted net income. 33 ($ in millions, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Net income $ 589.2 One-time tax benefit from the Tax Act (173.4 ) Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) $ 415.8 Per diluted share: Net income $ 1.67 One-time tax benefit from the Tax Act (.49 ) Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) $ 1.18 Shares used in diluted share calculations: GAAP 353.2 Non-GAAP 353.2 IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: The Company, its competitors and industry in general are subject to various domestic and foreign requirements relating to the environment. The Company believes its policies, practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling, use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances have been in accordance with environmental laws and regulations in effect at the time such use and disposal occurred. The Company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters. In certain of these matters, the Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party by domestic and foreign environmental agencies. The Company has accrued the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the Company will incur such costs in the future. Expenditures related to environmental activities in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $1.2 million, $1.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively. While the timing and amount of the ultimate costs associated with future environmental cleanup cannot be determined, management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated cash flow, liquidity or financial condition. 34 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES: The Company significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note A of the consolidated financial statements. In the preparation of the Company financial statements, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented. The following are accounting policies which, in the opinion of management, are particularly sensitive and which, if actual results are different from estimates used by management, may have a material impact on the financial statements. Operating Leases Trucks sold pursuant to agreements accounted for as operating leases are disclosed in Note F of the consolidated financial statements. In determining its estimate of the residual value of such vehicles, the Company considers the length of the lease term, the truck model, the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand. Operating lease terms generally range from three to five years. The resulting residual values on operating leases generally range between 30% and 70% of original equipment cost. If the sales price of the trucks at the end of the term of the agreement differs from the Company estimated residual value, a gain or loss will result. Future market conditions, changes in government regulations and other factors outside the Company control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts. Residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant. A decrease in the estimated equipment residual values would increase annual depreciation expense over the remaining lease term. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity were generally lower than the residual values on the equipment, resulting in an increase in depreciation expense of $31.0 million, $45.5 million and $9.6 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases in the Financial Services segment and residual value guarantee on trucks accounted for as operating leases in the Truck segment was $2.41 billion. A 10% decrease in used truck values worldwide, if expected to persist over the remaining maturities of the Company operating leases, would reduce residual value estimates and result in the Company recording an average of approximately $69 million of additional depreciation per year. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses related to the Company loans and finance leases is disclosed in Note E of the consolidated financial statements. The Company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments, retail and wholesale. The retail segment consists of retail loans and direct and sales-type finance leases, net of unearned interest. The wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral. The wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment. Wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables, and the Company requires periodic reporting of the wholesale dealer financial condition, conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases, obtains guarantees or other security such as dealership assets. In determining the allowance for credit losses, retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base, their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest, generally over three to five years, and they are secured by the same type of collateral. The allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves. The Company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for impairment. Finance receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss. A finance receivable is impaired if it is considered probable the Company will be unable to collect all contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled. In addition, all retail loans and leases which have been classified as TDRs and all customer accounts over 90 days past due are considered impaired. Generally, impaired accounts are on non-accrual status. Impaired accounts classified as TDRs which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the Company will collect all principal and interest payments. Impaired receivables are generally considered collateral dependent. Large balance retail and all wholesale impaired receivables are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses. The determination of reserves for large balance impaired receivables considers the fair value of the associated collateral. When the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the Company recorded investment, no reserve is recorded. Small balance impaired receivables with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss information discussed below. 35 The Company evaluates finance receivables that a re not individually impaired on a collective basis and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information, using past due account data and current market conditions. Information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts, repossession rates, the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse. The Company has develop ed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience, taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions. A projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses in herent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined as probable based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the Company borrowers and their ability to repay. After determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management estimate of incurred credit losses, net of recoveries, inherent in the portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly based on the most recent past due account information and current market conditions. As accounts become past due, the likelihood that they will not be fully collected increases. The Company experience indicates the probability of not fully collecting past due accounts ranges between 30% and 70%. Over the past three years, the Company year-end 30+ days past due accounts have ranged between .4% and .5% of loan and lease receivables. Historically, a 100 basis point increase in the 30+ days past due percentage has resulted in an increase in credit losses of 3 to 39 basis points of receivables. At December 31, 2018, 30+ days past dues were .4%. If past dues were 100 basis points higher or 1.4% as of December 31, 2018, the Company estimate of credit losses would likely have increased by a range of $2 to $33 million depending on the extent of the past dues, the estimated value of the collateral as compared to amounts owed and general economic factors. Product Warranty Product warranty is disclosed in Note I of the consolidated financial statements. The expenses related to product warranty are estimated and recorded at the time products are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims, net of recoveries. Management takes actions to minimize warranty costs through quality-improvement programs; however, actual claim costs incurred could materially differ from the estimated amounts and require adjustments to the reserve. Historically those adjustments have not been material. Over the past three years, warranty expense as a percentage of Truck, Parts and Other net sales and revenues has ranged between 1.3% and 1.6%. If the 2018 warranty expense had been .2% higher as a percentage of net sales and revenues in 2018, warranty expense would have increased by approximately $44.3 million.
