ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following discussion and analysis provides information about our business, the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of HF Foods Group Inc. This information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Part II Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023. Overview We market and distribute Asian specialty food products, seafood, fresh produce, frozen and dry food, and non-food products primarily to Asian restaurants and other foodservice customers throughout the United States. HF Foods was formed through a merger between two complementary market leaders, HF Foods Group Inc. and B&R Global. On December 30, 2021, HF Foods acquired a leading seafood supplier, the Great Wall Group, resulting in the addition of three distribution centers, located in Illinois and Texas (the Great Wall Acquisition ). On April 29, 2022, HF Foods acquired substantially all of the assets of Sealand Food, Inc. (the Sealand Acquisition ), one of the largest frozen seafood suppliers servicing the Asian/Chinese restaurant market along the eastern seaboard, from Massachusetts to Florida, as well as Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. See Note 7 - Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding recent acquisitions. We have grown our distribution network to eighteen distribution centers and cross-docks servicing forty-six states and covering approximately 95% of the contiguous United States with a fleet of over 400 refrigerated vehicles. Capitalizing on our deep understanding of the Chinese culture, with over 1,000 employees and subcontractors and supported by two call centers in China, we have become a trusted partner serving approximately 15,000 Asian restaurants, providing sales and service support to customers who mainly converse in Mandarin or other Chinese dialects. We are dedicated to serving the vast array of Asian and Chinese restaurants in need of high-quality and specialized food ingredients at competitive prices. How to Assess HF Foods Performance In assessing our performance, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures, including principal growth in net revenue, gross profit, distribution, selling and administrative expenses, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. The key measures that we use to evaluate the performance of our business are set forth below: Net Revenue Net revenue is equal to gross sales minus sales returns, sales incentives that we offer to our customers, such as rebates and discounts that are offsets to gross sales; and certain other adjustments. Our net revenue is driven by changes in number of customers and average customer order amount, product inflation that is reflected in the pricing of our products and mix of products sold. Gross Profit Gross profit is equal to net revenue minus cost of revenue. Cost of revenue primarily includes inventory costs (net of supplier consideration), inbound freight, customs clearance fees and other miscellaneous expenses. Cost of revenue generally changes as we incur higher or lower costs from suppliers and as the customer and product mix changes. 29 Distribution, Selling and Administrative Expenses Distribution, selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits for employees and contract laborers, trucking and fuel expenses, utilities, maintenance and repair expenses, insurance expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, selling and marketing expenses, professional fees and other operating expenses. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Discussion of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, that we believe provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial performance with other companies in the same industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, and such information is not meant to replace or supersede GAAP measures. Management uses EBITDA to measure operating performance, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude certain unusual, non-cash, or non-recurring expenses. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from non-recurring expenses, and other non-cash charges and is more reflective of other factors that affect our operating performance. The definition of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies in the industry. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not defined under GAAP and are subject to important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of HF Foods results as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA: excludes certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available; does not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service our debt. For additional information on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, see the section entitled EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below. Financial Review Highlights for 2023 included: Net revenue: Net revenue was $1,148.5 million in 2023, compared to $1,170.5 million in 2022, a decrease of $22.0 million, or 1.9%. This decrease was primarily attributable to deflationary pricing in imported frozen seafood, Asian Specialty, poultry, and, to a lesser extent, the exit of our chicken processing businesses. Gross profit : Gross profit was $204.0 million in 2023 compared to $205.5 million in 2022, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 0.7%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower revenue. Gross profit margin of 17.8% for 2023 increased from 17.6% in the prior year. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses : Distribution, selling and administrative expenses increased by $0.1 million, or 0.1%, mainly due to settlement amounts received partially offset by an increase in payroll and related labor costs as well as insurance costs. During 2023, we received legal settlements amounts totaling $9.25 million and $1.7 million, of which we paid $0.9 million, for a net settlement totaling $10.0 million. These net settlement amounts were recorded as a reduction of distribution, selling and administrative expenses. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased to 17.0% in 2023 from 16.7% in 2022, primarily due to the costs disclosed above combined with the decrease in revenue year over year. 30 Net (loss) income attributable to HF Foods Group Inc .: Net loss attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. was $2.2 million in 2023 compared to net income of $0.5 million in 2022. The decrease of $2.6 million was primarily driven by a decrease in our income from operations of $1.6 million, an increase in interest expense of $4.0 million, a change in fair value of interest rate swap contracts of $2.4 million, and a change in other income of $0.7 million, partially offset by a favorable change in lease guarantee expense of $6.1 million. Exit of chicken processing businesses: During the second half of 2023, we exited both of our low margin chicken processing businesses on the east and west coast as part of our commitment to refocusing on our core business. Results of Operations Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2023 to Year Ended December 31, 2022 The following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 . The historical results presented below are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period. Year Ended December 31, Change ($ in thousands) 2023 2022 Amount Net revenue $ 1,148,493 $ 1,170,467 $ (21,974) Cost of revenue 944,462 964,955 (20,493) Gross profit 204,031 205,512 (1,481) Distribution, selling and administrative expenses 195,062 194,953 109 Income from operations 8,969 10,559 (1,590) Interest expense 11,478 7,457 4,021 Other income (1,091) (1,829) 738 Change in fair value of interest rate swap contracts 1,580 (817) 2,397 Lease guarantee (income) expense (377) 5,744 (6,121) (Loss) income before income taxes (2,621) 4 (2,625) Income tax expense (benefit) 41 (231) 272 Net (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income (2,662) 235 (2,897) Less: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (488) (225) (263) Net (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. $ (2,174) $ 460 $ (2,634) The following table sets forth the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 82.2 % 82.4 % Gross profit 17.8 % 17.6 % Distribution, selling and administrative expenses 17.0 % 16.7 % Income from operations 0.8 % 0.9 % Interest expense 1.0 % 0.6 % Other income (0.1) % (0.2) % Change in fair value of interest rate swap contracts 0.1 % (0.1) % Lease guarantee expense % 0.5 % (Loss) income before income taxes (0.2) % % Income tax expense (benefit) % % Net (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income (0.2) % % Less: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests % % Net (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. (0.2) % % 31 Net Revenue Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by $22.0 million, or 1.9%, compared to the same period in 2022. This decrease was primarily attributable to deflationary pricing product categories such as frozen seafood, poultry, Asian Specialty and packaging. The revenue decrease due to pricing was partially offset by higher volume and the Seafood revenue generated due to the Sealand Acquisition which has a full year of revenue in 2023 compared to a partial year in 2022. Gross Profit Gross profit was $204.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $205.5 million in the same period in 2022 , a decrease of $1.5 million, or 0.7% . The gross profit decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in revenue from Meat and Poultry, and to a lesser extent, Packaging and Other, partially offset by the increased revenue from Asian Specialty, the additional Seafood revenue generated due to the Sealand Acquisition and the successful execution of our Seafood centralized purchasing program. During the year ended December 31, 2023, poultry pricing came down from the elevated levels we benefited from during the same period in 2022. Gross profit margin for 2023 of 17.8% increased from 17.6% in the prior year. Distribution, Selling and Administrative Expenses Distribution, selling and administrative expenses of $195.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 remained consistent with prior year expenses of $195.0 million. For 2023, there was a decrease in professional fees as a result of the net settlement amounts received totaling $10.0 million, partially offset by increases of $7.3 million in payroll and related labor costs, inclusive of the additional costs due to the Sealand Acquisition, and $2.0 million in insurance related costs. Professional fees decreased $12.9 million, or $2.9 million net of the settlement amounts received, to $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 , from $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, we recognized an asset impairment of $1.2 million related to the exit of our chicken processing facility. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased to 17.0% for the year ended December 31, 2023 from 16.7% in the same period in 2022, primarily due to the costs disclosed above combined with the decrease in revenue year over year. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $4.0 million or 53.9% , compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a sharply higher interest-rate environment. Average floating interest rates on our floating-rate debt for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by approximately 3.4% on the line of credit and 3.4% on the JPMorgan Chase mortgage-secured term loan, compared to the same period in 2022. Our average daily line of credit balance decreased by $10.2 million, or 18.5%, to $44.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and our average daily JPMorgan Chase mortgage-secured term loan balance increased by $6.5 million, or 6.4%, to $108.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $102.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Income tax expense (benefit) was an income tax expense of approximately $41,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to income tax benefit of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the impact of non-deductible items, change in valuation allowance, and state taxes, partially offset by the expiration of the statute of limitations in relation to unrecognized tax benefits, tax credits, and other tax adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2023. Net (Loss) Income Attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. Net loss attributable to HF Foods Group Inc. was $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 , compared to net income of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease of $2.6 million was primarily driven by a decrease in our income from operations of $1.6 million, an increase in interest expense of $4.0 million, a change in fair value of interest rate swap contracts of $2.4 million, and a change in other income of $0.7 million, partially offset by a favorable change in lease guarantee expense of $6.1 million. 32 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA The following table reconciles EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure: Year Ended December 31, Change ($ in thousands) 2023 2022 Amount Net (loss) income $ (2,662) $ 235 $ (2,897) Interest expense 11,478 7,457 4,021 Income tax expense (benefit) 41 (231) 272 Depreciation and amortization 25,918 24,936 982 EBITDA 34,775 32,397 2,378 Lease guarantee (income) expense (377) 5,744 (6,121) Change in fair value of interest rate swap contracts 1,580 (817) 2,397 Stock-based compensation expense 3,352 1,257 2,095 Business transformation costs (1) 929 929 Acquisition-related costs 1,130 (1,130) Other non-routine expense (2) 3,124 3,124 Asset impairment charges 1,200 422 778 Adjusted EBITDA $ 44,583 $ 40,133 $ 4,450 _________________ (1) Represents non-recurring costs associated with the launch of strategic projects including supply chain management improvements and technology infrastructure initiatives. (2) Includes contested proxy and related legal and consulting costs and facility closure costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2023, we had cash of approximately $15.2 million, checks issued not presented for payment of $4.5 million and access to approximately $37.6 million in additional funds through our $100.0 million line of credit, subject to a borrowing base calculation. We have funded working capital and other capital requirements primarily by cash flow from operations and bank loans. Cash is required to pay purchase costs for inventory, salaries, fuel and trucking expenses, selling expenses, rental expenses, income taxes, other operating expenses and to service debts. We believe that our cash flow generated from operations is sufficient to meet our normal working capital needs for at least the next twelve months. However, our ability to repay our current obligations will depend on the future realization of our current assets. Management has considered the historical experience, the economy, the trends in the foodservice distribution industry to determine the expected collectability of accounts receivable and the realization of inventories as of December 31, 2023. We are party to an amortizing interest rate swap contract with JPMorgan Chase for an initial notional amount of $120.0 million, expiring in March 2028, as a means to partially hedge our existing floating rate loans exposure. Pursuant to the agreement, we will pay the swap counterparty a fixed rate of 4.11% in exchange for floating payments based on CME Term SOFR. Effective as of April 20, 2023, we and certain parties to the Delaware Action reached an agreement to settle the Delaware Action on the terms and conditions set forth in a binding term sheet (the Binding Term Sheet ), which was incorporated into a long-form settlement agreement on May 5, 2023 and filed with the Court of Chancery on May 8, 2023. The Binding Term Sheet provided for, among other things, the dismissal of the Delaware Action with prejudice, thereby resolving all existing and potential liability against all named defendants in the Delaware Action, in exchange for Zhou Min Ni, a former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Chan Sin Wong, a former President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, making a payment to the Company in the sum of $9.25 million (the Settlement Amount ). The full terms of the settlement of the Delaware Action were incorporated into the long-form settlement agreement, which was subject to approval of the Court of Chancery (as amended on November 1, 2023, the Settlement Agreement ). On September 8, 2023, the Court of Chancery approved the proposed settlement and an application by Bishop counsel for an award of attorneys fees and expenses. 33 On October 16, 2023, after approval of the settlement had become final, the Ni Defendants paid the Company $1.5 million of the Settlement Amount. On December 1, 2023, the Company received 1,997,423 shares of the Company common stock as consideration for the remaining $7.75 million balance due under the Settlement Agreement. All of the shares of Company common stock received as consideration for the Settlement have been placed by the Company in treasury. Please refer to Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements herein for additional information. Management believes we have sufficient funds to meet our working capital requirements and debt obligations in the next twelve months. However, there are a number of factors that could potentially arise which might result in shortfalls in anticipated cash flow, such as the demand for our products, economic conditions, competitive pricing in the foodservice distribution industry, and our bank and suppliers being able to provide continued support. If the future cash flow from operations and other capital resources is insufficient to fund our liquidity needs, we may have to resort to reducing or delaying our expected acquisition plans, liquidating assets, obtaining additional debt or equity capital, or refinancing all or a portion of our debt. As of December 31, 2023, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that currently have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, changes in financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. The following table summarizes cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Years Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2023 2022 Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 15,804 $ 31,284 $ (15,480) Net cash used in investing activities (1,514) (50,786) 49,272 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (23,347) 28,999 (52,346) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (9,057) $ 9,497 $ (18,554) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, changes in deferred income taxes and others, and includes the effect of working capital changes. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $15.5 million, or 49%, primarily due to the timing of working capital outlays. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we implemented new enterprise accounting and finance applications, which modified our accounts receivable, accounts payable and treasury processes. As a result of this transformation, we significantly paid down our accounts payable, which negatively impacted our net cash provided by operating activities. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $49.3 million, or 97%, primarily due to payments related to acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2022. Financing Activities Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities decreased by $52.3 million to $23.3 million used in financing activities primarily due to the reduction in proceeds from long-term debt for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, checks issued not presented for payment decreased significantly for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to the reduction in checks issued as a result of our new enterprise accounting and finance applications. Critical Accounting Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These principles require management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates include, but are not limited to, inventory reserves, impairment of long-lived assets, impairment of goodwill, and the purchase price allocation and fair value of assets and liabilities acquired with respect to business combinations. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and the actual results, future financial statements will be affected. 34 We believe that among our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations. Business Combinations We account for our business combinations using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805 ( ASC 805 ), Business Combinations . The purchase method of accounting requires that the consideration transferred be allocated to the assets, including separately identifiable assets and liabilities we acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The consideration transferred in an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of the assets given, liabilities incurred, and equity instruments issued as well as the contingent considerations and all contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date. Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired or assumed are measured separately at their fair value as of the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any noncontrolling interests. The excess of (i) the total of cost of acquisition, fair value of the noncontrolling interests and acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over, (ii) the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree, is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in earnings. We estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, its estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to future expected revenues and cash flows, useful lives, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. On the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, as of December 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We have concluded we are one reporting unit for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. We review the carrying value of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable and annually for goodwill as required by ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other . Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable, include a sustained decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry. This guidance provides the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If, based on a review of qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative analysis. If the quantitative analysis indicates the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we measure any goodwill impairment losses as the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 35 As a result of our 2023 financial performance in comparison to previous forecasts, combined with our level of stock price, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment. A quantitative goodwill impairment analysis requires valuation of the respective reporting unit, which requires complex analysis and judgment. We use a combination of discounted cash flow ( DCF ) model and market approaches, such as public company comparable analysis and comparable acquisitions analysis to determine fair value. The income approach and market approaches were weighted equally to estimate fair value. The income approach requires detailed forecasts of cash flows, including significant assumptions such as revenue growth rates, gross profit margin, and an estimate of weighted-average cost of capital which we believe approximate the assumptions from a market participant perspective. The market approaches are primarily impacted by an enterprise value multiple of EBITDA. These estimates incorporate many uncertain factors which could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rate, tax rates, costs, customer behavior, regulatory environment and other macroeconomic changes. We categorize the fair value determination as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. The results of testing as of December 31, 2023, concluded that the estimated fair value exceeded carrying value, and no impairment existed as of that date. In addition, we corroborated the reasonableness of the total fair value of the reporting unit by assessing the implied control premium based on our market capitalization. Our market capitalization is calculated using the number of common shares issued and common stock publicly traded price. We also consider the amount of headroom for the reporting unit when determining whether an impairment existed. Headroom is the difference between the fair value of a reporting unit and its carrying value. The fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the reporting unit carrying value by approximately $10%, or $45.0 million. No goodwill impairment was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 8 - Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Assumptions used in impairment testing are made at a point in time and require significant judgment; therefore, they are subject to change based on the facts and circumstances present at each impairment test date. Additionally, these assumptions are generally interdependent and do not change in isolation. We performed sensitivity analyses on the key inputs and assumptions used in determining the estimated fair value of our reporting unit by utilizing changes in assumptions that would reasonably likely occur. Assuming all other assumptions and inputs used in the fair value analysis are held constant, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption, a 1x decrease in the respective EBITDA multiple assumptions, a 25 basis point decrease in the gross profit margin assumption, and a 50 basis point decrease in the long-term revenue growth rate assumption would result in a decrease in the fair value of our reporting unit of approximately $14.8 million, $36.9 million, $8.4 million, and $22.6 million, respectively. These estimated changes in fair value are not necessarily representative of the actual impairment that would be recorded in the event of a fair value decline. If, in future periods, the financial performance of the reporting unit does not meet forecasted expectations, or a prolonged decline occurs in the market price of our common stock, it may cause a change in the results of the impairment assessment and, as such, could result in an impairment of goodwill. Impairment of Long-lived Assets We assess our long-lived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Factors which may indicate potential impairment include a significant underperformance related to the historical or projected future operating results or a significant negative industry or economic trend. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows which the assets or asset groups are expected to generate. If property and equipment and intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value. We impaired machinery used in the operations within HF Foods Industrial, Inc. and recognized impairment expense of $1.2 million in distribution, selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2023 . We impaired our acquired developed technology attributable to Syncglobal, Inc. and recognized impairment expense of $0.4 million in distribution, selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2022. 36 Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
