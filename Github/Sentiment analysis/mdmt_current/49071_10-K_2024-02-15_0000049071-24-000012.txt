ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For discussion of 2021 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this 2023 Form 10-K, refer to "Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" found in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2023. Executive Overview General Humana Inc., headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, is committed to putting health first for our teammates, our customers, and our company. Through our Humana insurance services, and our CenterWell health care services, we make it easier for the millions of people we serve to achieve their best health delivering the care and service they need, when they need it. These efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with Medicare, Medicaid, families, individuals, military service personnel, and communities at large. Our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance. The benefit ratio, which is computed by taking total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue, represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability. The operating cost ratio, which is computed by taking total operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of total revenue less investment income, represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency. Employer Group Commercial Medical Products Business Exit In February 2023, we announced our planned exit from the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business, which includes all fully insured, self-funded and Federal Employee Health Benefit medical plans, as well as associated wellness and rewards programs. No other Humana health plan offerings are materially affected. Following a strategic review, we determined the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business was no longer positioned to sustainably meet the needs of commercial members over the long term or support our long-term strategic plans. The exit from this line of business will be phased over the 18 to 24 months following our February 2023 announcement. Sale of Hospice and Personal Care Divisions On August 11, 2022, we completed the sale of a 60% i nterest in Gentiva (formerly Kindred) Hospice to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, or CD&R, for cash proceeds of approximately $2.7 billion, net of cash disposed, including debt repayments from Gentiva Hospice to Humana of $1.9 billion. In connection with the sale we recognized a pre-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of $237 million, which was reported as a gain on sale of Gentiva Hospice in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. COVID-19 The emergence and spread of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, beginning in the first quarter of 2020 has impacted our business. Initially during periods of increased incidences of COVID-19, a reduction in non-COVID-19 hospital admissions for non-emergent and elective medical care resulted in lower overall healthcare system utilization. At the same time, COVID-19 treatment and testing costs increased utilization. During 2022, we experienced lower overall utilization of the healthcare system than anticipated, as the reduction in COVID-19 utilization following the increased incidence associated with the Omicron variant outpaced the increase in non-COVID-19 utilization. The significant disruption in utilization during 2020 also impacted our ability to implement clinical initiatives to manage health care costs and chronic conditions of our members, and appropriately document their risk profiles, and, as such, significantly affected our 2021 revenue under the risk adjustment payment model for Medicare Advantage plans. Finally, changes in utilization patterns and actions taken in 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the suspension of certain financial recovery programs for a period of time and shifting the timing of claim payments and provider capitation surplus payments, impacted our claim reserve development and operating cash flows for 2021. 43 The COVID-19 National Emergency declared in 2020 was terminated on April 10, 2023 and the Public Health Emergency expired on May 11, 2023. Value Creation Initiatives and Impairment Charges In order to create capacity to fund growth and investment in our Medicare Advantage business and further expansion of our healthcare services capabilities beginning in 2022, we committed to drive additional value for the enterprise through cost saving, productivity initiatives, and value acceleration from previous investments. As a result of these initiatives, we recorded charges of $436 million and $473 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, within operating costs in the consolidated statements of income. These charges were recorded at the corporate level and not allocated to the segments. We expect to incur additional charges through the end of 2024. The value creation initiative charges primarily relate to $237 million and $248 million in asset impairments in 2023 and 2022, respectively, as well as $199 million and $116 million in severance charges in connection with workforce optimization in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The remainder of the 2022 charges primarily relate to external consulting fees. During 2023, we also recorded severance charges of $70 million within operating costs in our consolidated statement of income as a result of our exit from the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business and impairment charges of $91 million, including $55 million relating to indefinite-lived intangibles. The indefinite-lived intangibles impairment charges were included within operating costs in our consolidated statement of income with the remaining impairment charges included within investment income. Business Segments During December 2022, we realigned our businesses into two distinct segments: Insurance and CenterWell. The Insurance segment includes the businesses that were previously included in the Retail and Group and Specialty segments, as well as the Pharmacy Benefit Manager, or PBM, business which was previously included in the Healthcare Services segment. The CenterWell segment (formerly Healthcare Services) represents our payor-agnostic healthcare services offerings, including pharmacy solutions, primary care, and home solutions. In addition to the new segment classifications being utilized to assess performance and allocate resources, we believe this simpler structure will create greater collaboration across the Insurance and CenterWell businesses and will accelerate work that is underway to centralize and integrate operations within the organization. 2021 segment financial information was recast to conform to the 2022 presentation. Our two reportable segments, Insurance and CenterWell, are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers, as described below. These segment groupings are consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Decision Maker, to assess performance and allocate resources. For segment financial information, refer to Note 18 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. The Insurance segment consists of Medicare benefits, marketed to individuals or directly via group Medicare accounts, as well as our contract with CMS to administer the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition, or LI-NET, prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide Medicaid, dual eligible demonstration, and Long-Term Support Services benefits, which we refer to collectively as our state-based contracts. This segment also includes products consisting of employer group commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits marketed to individuals and employer groups, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health benefits, as well as administrative services only, or ASO. In addition, our Insurance segment includes our military services business, primarily our T-2017 East Region contract, as well as the operations of our PBM business. The CenterWell segment includes our pharmacy solutions, primary care, and home solutions operations. The segment also includes our strategic partnerships with WCAS to develop and operate senior-focused, payor-agnostic, primary care centers, as well as our minority ownership interest in Gentiva Hospice operations. Services offered by 44 this segment are designed to enhance the overall healthcare experience. These services may lead to lower utilization associated with improved member health and/or lower drug costs. The results of each segment are measured by income (loss) from operations. Transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our CenterWell segment, primarily pharmacy solutions, primary care, and home solutions, to our Insurance segment customers. Intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation. Members served by our segments often use the same provider networks, enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. We allocate most operating expenses to our segments. Assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments, including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations, interest expense on corporate debt, and certain other corporate expenses. These items are managed at a corporate level. These corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and are included with intersegment eliminations. Seasonality COVID-19 disrupted the pattern of our quarterly earnings and operating cash flows largely due to the temporary deferral of non-essential care which resulted in reductions in non-COVID-19 hospital admissions and lower overall healthcare system utilization during higher levels of COVID-19 hospital admissions. At the same time, during periods of increased incidences of COVID-19, COVID-19 treatment and testing costs increase. One of the product offerings of our Insurance segment is Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDP, under the Medicare Part D program. Our quarterly Insurance segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. The Medicare Part D benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member plan period, which begins annually on January 1 for renewals. These plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages. As a result, the PDP benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses. In addition, the number of low income senior members as well as year-over-year changes in the mix of membership in our standalone PDP products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern. The Insurance segment also experiences seasonality in the commercial fully-insured product offering. The effect on the Insurance segment benefit ratio is opposite of the Medicare stand-alone PDP impact, with the benefit ratio increasing as fully-insured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum out-of-pocket expenses. The Employer Group Commercial Fully-Insured business did not impact the Insurance segment benefit ratio for the year ended December 31, 2023 and increased the Insurance segment benefit ratio by 10 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Insurance segment also experiences seasonality in the operating cost ratio as a result of costs incurred in the second half of the year associated with the Medicare marketing season. The Insurance segment may experience adverse impacts in the operating cost ratio as a result of our Employer Group Commercial Medical Products exit phased over the 18 to 24 months following our February 2023 announcement. The Employer Group Commercial Fully-Insured business increased the Insurance segment operating cost ratio by 30 basis points and increased the Insurance segment operating cost ratio by 40 basis points for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 45 Highlights Our strategy offers our members affordable health care combined with a positive consumer experience in growing markets. At the core of this strategy is our integrated care delivery model, which unites quality care, high member engagement, and sophisticated data analytics. Our approach to primary, physician-directed care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent, integrated, cost-effective, and member-focused, provided by both employed physicians and physicians with network contract arrangements. The model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole, while offering our members a simple, seamless healthcare experience. We believe this strategy is positioning us for long-term growth in both membership and earnings. We offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a fee-for-service to a value-based arrangement. These include performance bonuses, shared savings and shared risk relationships. At December 31, 2023, approximately 3,764,300 members, or 70%, of our individual Medicare Advantage members were in value-based relationships under our integrated care delivery model, as compared to 3,175,500 members, or 70%, at December 31, 2022. On January 31, 2024, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued its preliminary 2025 Medicare Advantage and Part D payment rates and proposed policy changes, collectively, the Advance Notice. CMS has invited public comment on the Advance Notice before publishing final rates on or before April 1, 2024, or the Final Notice. In the Advance Notice, CMS estimates Medicare Advantage plans across the sector will, on average, experience a 0.16% decrease in benchmark funding based on proposals included therein. As indicated by CMS, its estimate excludes the impact of fee-for-service county rebasing/re-pricing since the related impact is dependent upon finalization of certain data, which will be available with the publication of the Final Notice. Based on our preliminary analysis using the same factors included in CMS estimate, the components of which are detailed on CMS website, we anticipate the proposals in the Advance Notice would result in a change to our benchmark funding that is approximately 160 basis points worse than our expectation of a flat rate environment. This difference is primarily due to the proposed effective growth rate restatements, which we did not anticipate in light of the higher medical cost trends experienced across the industry, as well as the negative impact of CMS proposed normalization factors. As part of our typical engagement with the agency, we will provide actuarial data with respect to our concerns regarding these items. We will continue to analyze the Advance Notice and will draw upon our program expertise to provide CMS formal commentary on the impact of the Advance Notice and the related impact upon Medicare beneficiaries quality of care, affordability, and service to its members through the Medicare Advantage program. Net income attributable to Humana was $2.5 billion, or $20.00 per diluted common share, and $2.8 billion, or $22.08 per diluted common share, in 2023 and 2022, respectively. This comparison was significantly impacted by the gain on sale of Gentiva Hospice, put/call valuation adjustments associated with non-consolidating minority interest investments, transaction and integration costs, the change in the fair market value of publicly-traded equity securities, an accrued charge related to certain litigation expenses, charges associated with value creation initiatives, and impairment charges. The impact of these adjustments to our consolidated income before income taxes and equity in net earnings and diluted earnings per common share was as follows for the 2023 and 2022 periods: 46 2023 2022 (in millions) Consolidated income before income taxes and equity in net (losses) earnings: Gain on sale of Gentiva Hospice $ $ (237) Put/call valuation adjustments associated with our non-consolidating minority interest investments 320 68 Transaction and integration costs (48) 105 Change in fair market value of publicly-traded equity securities (1) 123 Accrued charge related to certain anticipated litigation expenses 105 Value creation initiatives 436 473 Impairment charges 91 Total $ 903 $ 532 2023 2022 Diluted earnings per common share: Gain on sale of Gentiva Hospice $ $ (1.86) Put/call valuation adjustments associated with our non-consolidating minority interest investments 2.57 0.53 Transaction and integration costs (0.38) 0.83 Change in fair market value of publicly-traded equity securities (0.01) 0.97 Accrual charge related to certain anticipated litigation expenses 0.84 Value creation initiatives 3.50 3.72 Impairment charges 0.73 Net tax impact of transactions (1.67) (1.52) Total $ 5.58 $ 2.67 47 Regulatory Environment We are and will continue to be regularly subject to new laws and regulations, changes to existing laws and regulations, and judicial determinations that impact the interpretation and applicability of those laws and regulations. The Health Care Reform Law, the Families First Act, the CARES Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, and related regulations, are examples of laws which have enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the U.S. health insurance industry, including, among others, mandated coverage requirements, mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with insurance products, rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios, adjustments to Medicare Advantage premiums, the establishment of federally facilitated or state-based exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers, and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values, and changes to the Part D prescription drug benefit design . It is reasonably possible that these laws and regulations, as well as other current or future legislative, judicial or regulatory changes including restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network, manage and sell our products, or otherwise operate our business, or restrictions on profitability, including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our Medicare Advantage profitability to our non-Medicare Advantage business profitability, or compare the profitability of various products within our Medicare Advantage business, and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other, increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, increases in regulation of our prescription drug benefit businesses, or changes to the Part D prescription drug benefit design (and uncertainty arising from the implementation of these changes) in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting our ability to expand into new markets, increasing our medical and operating costs, further lowering our Medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments); our financial position (including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill); and our cash flows. We intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, including the primary factors that accounted for those changes. Transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our CenterWell segment, primarily pharmacy solutions, primary care, and home solutions, to our Insurance segment customers and are described in Note 18 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. 48 Comparison of Results of Operations for 2023 and 2022 The following discussion primarily details our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, or the 2023 period, and the year ended December 31, 2022, or the 2022 period. Consolidated Change 2023 2022 Dollars Percentage (dollars in millions, except per common share results) Revenues: Insurance premiums $ 101,272 $ 87,712 $ 13,560 15.5 % Services: Insurance 1,000 850 150 17.6 % CenterWell 3,033 3,926 (893) (22.7) % Total services revenue 4,033 4,776 (743) (15.6) % Investment income 1,069 382 687 179.8 % Total revenues 106,374 92,870 13,504 14.5 % Operating expenses: Benefits 88,394 75,690 12,704 16.8 % Operating costs 13,188 12,671 517 4.1 % Depreciation and amortization 779 709 70 9.9 % Total operating expenses 102,361 89,070 13,291 14.9 % Income from operations 4,013 3,800 213 5.6 % Gain on sale of Gentiva Hospice (237) (237) (100.0) % Interest expense 493 401 92 22.9 % Other expense, net 137 68 69 101.5 % Income before income taxes and equity in net losses 3,383 3,568 (185) (5.2) % Provision for income taxes 836 762 74 9.7 % Equity in net losses (63) (4) 59 1475.0 % Net income $ 2,484 $ 2,802 $ (318) (11.3) % Diluted earnings per common share $ 20.00 $ 22.08 $ (2.08) (9.4) % Benefit ratio (a) 87.3 % 86.3 % 1.0 % Operating cost ratio (b) 12.5 % 13.7 % (1.2) % Effective tax rate 25.2 % 21.4 % 3.8 % (a) Represents total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue. (b) Represents total operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of total revenues less investment income. 49 Premiums Revenue Consolidated premiums revenue increased $13.6 billion, or 15.5%, from $87.7 billion in the 2022 period to $101.3 billion in the 2023 period primarily due to individual Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts membership growth and higher per member individual Medicare Advantage premiums. These factors were partially offset by the year-over-year decline in membership associated with group commercial medical, group Medicare Advantage and stand-alone PDP products, as well as the phase-out of COVID-19 sequestration relief in 2022. Services Revenue Consolidated services revenue decreased $0.7 billion, or 15.6%, from $4.8 billion in the 2022 period to $4.0 billion in the 2023 period primarily due to the divestiture of the 60% ownership of Gentiva Hospice in August 2022. Investment Income Investment income increased $0.7 billion, or 179.8%, from $0.4 billion in the 2022 period to $1.1 billion in the 2023 period primarily due to increase in interest income on our debt securities as well as the net unfavorable mark to market impact of our publicly-traded equity securities during the 2022 period. Benefits Expense Consolidated benefits expense increased $12.7 billion, or 16.8%, from $75.7 billion in the 2022 period to $88.4 billion in the 2023 period. The consolidated benefit ratio increased 100 basis points from 86.3% in the 2022 period to 87.3% in the 2023 period primarily due to investments in the benefit design of our Medicare Advantage products for 2023, higher than anticipated Medicare Advantage utilization trends, which further increased in the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by inpatient utilization, primarily for the months of November and December, and non-inpatient trends, predominately in the categories of physician, outpatient surgeries and supplemental benefits, as well as the impact of continued individual Medicare Advantage growth following the 2023 Annual Election Period, or AEP, including a high proportion of age-ins, which typically have a higher benefits expense ratio initially than the average new member. These increases were partially offset by increased individual Medicare Advantage premiums, decreased average unit costs given the additional 20% payment on COVID-19 admissions during the Public Health Emergency, which expired on May 11, 2023, as well as higher favorable prior-period development in 2023. Further, the 2023 ratio continues to reflect a shift in line of business mix, with growth in individual Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts and other membership, which can carry a higher benefits expense ratio. Consolidated benefits expense included $872 million of favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in the 2023 period and $415 million of favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in the 2022 period. Prior-period medical claims reserve development decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 90 basis points in the 2023 period and decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 50 basis points in the 2022 period. Operating Costs Our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs. We allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. Consolidated operating costs increased $0.5 billion, or 4.1%, from $12.7 billion in the 2022 period to $13.2 billion in the 2023 period. The consolidated operating cost ratio decreased 120 basis points from 13.7% in the 2022 period to 12.5% in the 2023 period. The ratio decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of the 60% ownership of Gentiva Hospice in August 2022, which carried a significantly higher operating cost ratio compared to the historical consolidated operating cost ratio, scale efficiencies associated with growth in individual Medicare Advantage membership, administrative cost efficiencies as a result of our value creation initiatives, as well as the impact of significantly reduced compensation accruals in 2023 for the annual incentive plan offered to employees across all levels of the company, in accordance with plan requirements, as our 2023 performance was negatively impacted by the previously-discussed higher Medicare Advantage utilization trends. These factors were partially offset by an 50 increase in commissions for brokers related to the individual Medicare Advantage membership growth in 2023, the impact of accelerated charges related to value creation initiatives in 2023 compared to 2022, impairment charges expensed in 2023, the phase-out of COVID-19 sequestration relief in 2022, and an accrual recorded in 2023 related to certain anticipated litigation expenses. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $70 million, or 9.9%, from $709 million in the 2022 period to $779 million in the 2023 period primarily due to capital expenditures. Interest Expense Interest expense increased $92 million, or 22.9%, from $401 million in the 2022 period to $493 million in the 2023 period primarily due to higher average interest cost on outstanding borrowings. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate during 2023 was 25.2% compared to the effective tax rate of 21.4% in 2022. The year-over-year increase in the effective income tax rates is primarily due to the favorable adjustment in relation to tax basis over book basis for the sale of Gentiva Hospice recognized in 2022, which resulted in book income in excess of taxable gain, an increase in our federal and state audit reserves for 2023, as well as a reduction in the recognized value of certain net operating losses. For a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate, refer to Note 12 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. 51 Insurance Segment Change 2023 2022 Members % Membership: Individual Medicare Advantage 5,408,900 4,565,600 843,300 18.5 % Group Medicare Advantage 509,600 565,100 (55,500) (9.8) % Medicare stand-alone PDP 2,849,100 3,551,300 (702,200) (19.8) % Total Medicare 8,767,600 8,682,000 85,600 1.0 % Medicare Supplement 307,200 313,600 (6,400) (2.0) % Commercial fully-insured 338,700 556,300 (217,600) (39.1) % State-based contracts and other 1,228,800 1,137,300 91,500 8.0 % Military services 5,960,200 5,959,900 300 % Commercial ASO 255,300 430,100 (174,800) (40.6) % Total Medical Membership 16,857,800 17,079,200 (221,400) (1.3) % Total Specialty Membership 4,868,300 5,194,800 (326,500) (6.3) % Change 2023 2022 $ % (in millions) Premiums and Services Revenue: Premiums: Individual Medicare Advantage $ 78,837 $ 65,591 $ 13,246 20.2 % Group Medicare Advantage 6,869 7,297 (428) (5.9) % Medicare stand-alone PDP 2,189 2,269 (80) (3.5) % Total Medicare 87,895 75,157 12,738 16.9 % Commercial fully-insured 3,527 4,389 (862) (19.6) % Specialty benefits 1,007 1,047 (40) (3.8) % Medicare Supplement 735 743 (8) (1.1) % State-based contracts and other 8,108 6,376 1,732 27.2 % Total premiums revenue 101,272 87,712 13,560 15.5 % Commercial ASO 237 300 (63) (21.0) % Military services and other 763 550 213 38.7 % Services revenue 1,000 850 150 17.6 % Total premiums and services revenue $ 102,272 $ 88,562 $ 13,710 15.5 % Income from operations $ 2,654 $ 3,022 $ (368) (12.2) % Benefit ratio 88.0 % 86.6 % 1.4 % Operating cost ratio 10.2 % 10.4 % (0.2) % Income from operations Insurance segment income from operations decreased $0.4 billion, or 12.2%, from $3.0 billion in the 2022 period to $2.6 billion in the 2023 period primarily due to the same factors impacting the segment's higher benefit ratio partially offset by the segment's lower operating cost ratio as more fully described below. 52 Enrollment Individual Medicare Advantage membership increased 843,300 members, or 18.5%, from 4,565,600 members as of December 31, 2022 to 5,408,900 members as of December 31, 2023 primarily due to membership additions associated with the 2023 AEP and continued growth in 2023. The year-ov er-year growth was further impacted by continued enrollment resulting from special elections, age-ins, and Dual Eligible Special Need Plans, or D-SNP, membership. I ndividual Medicare Advantage membership includes 871,300 D-SNP members as of December 31, 2023, a net increase of 202,400 members, or 30.3%, from 668,900 members as of December 31, 2022. For the full year 2024, we anticipate a net membership growth in our individual Medicare Advantage offerings of approximately 100,000 members. Group Medicare Advantage mem bership decreased 55,500 members, or 9.8%, from 565,100 members as of December 31, 2022 to 509,600 members as of December 31, 2023 reflecting the net loss of certain large accounts partially offset by continued growth in small group accounts. For the full year 2024 , we anticipate a net membership growth in our group Medicare Advantage offerings of approximately 45,000 members. Medic are stand-alone PDP membership decreased 702,200 members, or 19.8% , from 3,551,300 members as of December 31, 2022 to 2,849,100 members as of December 31, 2023 primarily due to continued intensified competition for Medicare stand-alone PDP offerings. For the full year 2024 , we anticipate a net membership decline in our Medicare stand-alone PDP offerings of approximately 650,000 members. State-based contracts and other membership increased 91,500 members, or 8.0%, from 1,137,300 members as of December 31, 2022 to 1,228,800 members as of December 31, 2023 reflecting the impact of membership additions associated with the implementation of the Louisiana and Ohio contracts effective January 2023 and February 2023, respectively, partially offset by ending the suspension of state eligibility redetermination efforts previously enacted as part of the Public Health Emergency. For the full year 2024 , we anticipate a net membership growth in our state-based contracts of approximately 250,000 members. Commercial fully-insured medical membership decreased 217,600 members, or 39.1%, from 556,300 members as of December 31, 2022 to 338,700 members as of December 31, 2023 and commercial ASO medical membership decreased 174,800 members, or 40.6%, from 430,100 members as of December 31, 2022 to 255,300 members as of December 31, 2023. These decreases reflect our planned exit of the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business, which includes all fully insured, self-funded and Federal Employee Health Benefit medical plans, as well as associated wellness and rewards programs. The exit from this line of business will be phased over the 18 to 24 months following our February 2023 announcement. Specialty membership decreased 326,500 members, or 6.3%, from 5,194,800 members as of December 31, 2022 to 4,868,300 members as of December 31, 2023 reflecting the decline in membership associated with our Optional Supplemental Benefit products as a result of enhanced mandatory dental and vision supplemental benefits on Medicare Advantage plans. In addition, the decline reflects loss of dental and vision individuals due to terminations as well as loss of dental and vision groups cross-sold with commercial medical products. Premiums revenue Insurance segment premiums revenue increased $13.6 billion, or 15.5%, from $87.7 billion in the 2022 period to $101.3 billion in the 2023 period primarily due to individual Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts membership growth and higher per member individual Medicare Advantage premiums. These factors were partially offset by the year-over-year decline in membership associated with group commercial medical, group Medicare Advantage and stand-alone PDP products, as well as the phase-out of COVID-19 sequestration relief in 2022. Services revenue Insurance segment services revenue increased $0.15 billion, or 17.6%, from $0.85 billion in the 2022 period to $1 billion in the 2023 period. 53 Benefits expense The Insurance segment benefit ratio increased 140 basis points from 86.6% in the 2022 period to 88.0% in the 2023 period primarily due to investments in the benefit design of our Medicare Advantage products for 2023, higher than anticipated Medicare Advantage utilization trends, which further increased in the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by inpatient utilization, primarily for the months of November and December, and non-inpatient trends, predominately in the categories of physician, outpatient surgeries and supplemental benefits, as well as the impact of continued individual Medicare Advantage growth following the 2023 Annual Election Period, or AEP, including a high proportion of age-ins, which typically have a higher benefits expense ratio initially than the average new member. These increases were partially offset by increased individual Medicare Advantage premiums, decreased average unit costs given the additional 20% payment on COVID-19 admissions during the Public Health Emergency, which expired on May 11, 2023, as well as higher favorable prior-period development in 2023. Further, the 2023 ratio continues to reflect a shift in line of business mix, with growth in individual Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts and other membership, which can carry a higher benefits expense ratio. The Insurance segment benefits expense included $872 million of favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in the 2023 period and $415 million of favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in the 2022 period. Prior-period medical claims reserve development decreased the Insurance segment benefit ratio by approximately 90 basis points in the 2023 period and decreased the Insurance segment benefit ratio by approximately 50 basis points in the 2022 period. Operating costs The Insurance segment operating cost ratio decreased 20 basis points from 10.4% in the 2022 period to 10.2% in the 2023 period primarily due to scale efficiencies associated with growth in individual Medicare Advantage membership, administrative cost efficiencies as a result of our value creation initiatives, as well as the impact of significantly reduced compensation accruals in 2023 for the annual incentive plan offered to employees across all levels of the company, in accordance with plan requirements, as our 2023 performance was negatively impacted by the previously-discussed higher Medicare Advantage utilization trends. These factors were partially offset by an increase in commissions for brokers related to the individual Medicare Advantage membership growth in 2023, the phase-out of COVID-19 sequestration relief in 2022 and an accrual recorded in 2023 related to certain anticipated litigation expenses. 54 CenterWell Segment Change 2023 2022 Dollars Percentage (in millions) Revenues: Services: Home solutions $ 1,342 $ 2,333 $ (991) (42.5) % Pharmacy solutions 849 1,025 (176) (17.2) % Primary care 842 568 274 48.2 % Total services revenue 3,033 3,926 (893) (22.7) % Intersegment revenues: Home solutions 1,589 553 1,036 187.3 % Pharmacy solutions 10,451 9,841 610 6.2 % Primary care 3,332 2,979 353 11.8 % Total intersegment revenues 15,372 13,373 1,999 14.9 % Total services and intersegment revenues $ 18,405 17,299 1,106 6.4 % Income from operations $ 1,404 $ 1,291 $ 113 8.8 % Operating cost ratio 91.2 % 91.5 % (0.3) % Income from operations CenterWell segment income from operations increased $0.1 billion, or 8.8%, from $1.3 billion in the 2022 period to $1.4 billion in the 2023 period. Services revenue CenterWell segment services revenue decreased $0.9 billion, or 22.7%, from $3.9 billion in the 2022 period to $3.0 billion in the 2023 period primarily due to the divestiture of the 60% ownership of Gentiva Hospice in August 2022. Intersegment revenues CenterWell segment intersegment revenues increased $2.0 billion, or 14.9%, from $13.4 billion in the 2022 period to $15.4 billion in the 2023 period primarily due to individual Medicare Advantage membership growth, which led to higher pharmacy solutions revenues, higher revenues associated with growth in the primary care business, and greater revenues associated with the home solutions business as a result of the expansion of the value-based care home model in 2023 compared to 2022. 55 Operating costs The CenterWell segment operating cost ratio decreased 30 basis points from 91.5% in the 2022 period to 91.2% in the 2023 period primarily due to an improving ratio in the primary care business driven by year-over-year medical costs favorability, administrative cost efficiencies related to the pharmacy solutions business, as well as the impact of significantly reduced compensation accruals in 2023 for the annual incentive plan offered to employees across all levels of the company, in accordance with plan requirements, as our 2023 performance was negatively impacted by the previously-discussed higher Medicare Advantage utilization trends. These factors were partially offset by the divestiture of the 60% ownership of Gentiva Hospice in August 2022, which carried a lower operating cost ratio compared to other businesses within the segment, the expansion of the value-based care model within the home solutions business, which carries a higher operating cost ratio compared to the core fee-for-service business, along with growth in Medicare Advantage episodes in the core fee-for-service business, as well as continued investments within the home solutions business to abate the pressures of the current nursing labor environment. Liquidity Historically, our primary sources of cash have included receipts of premiums, services revenue, and investment and other income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, and borrowings. Our primary uses of cash historically have included disbursements for claims payments, operating costs, interest on borrowings, taxes, purchases of investment securities, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repayments on borrowings, dividends, and share repurchases. Because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months, our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment. Conversely, cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment. From period to period, our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items including premiums receivable, benefits payable, and other receivables and payables. Our cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to and receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D subsidies for which we do not assume risk. The use of cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements of state departments of insurance (or comparable state regulators) which require, among other items, that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent. Our use of cash flows derived from our non-insurance subsidiaries, such as in our CenterWell segment, is generally not restricted by state departments of insurance (or comparable state regulators). For additional information on our liquidity risk, please refer to Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Form 10-K. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2023 from $5.1 billion at December 31, 2022. The change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is summarized as follows: 2023 2022 2021 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,981 $ 4,587 $ 2,262 Net cash used in investing activities (3,492) (1,006) (6,556) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (856) (1,914) 3,015 (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (367) $ 1,667 $ (1,279) 56 Cash Flow from Operating Activities Cash flows provided by operations of $4.0 billion in the 2023 period decreased $606 million from cash flows provided by operations of $4.6 billion in the 2022 period primarily due to lower earnings in the 2023 period compared to the 2022 period combined with the unfavorable impact of working capital changes. The most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of benefits expense and receipts for premiums. Benefits expense includes claim payments, capitation payments, pharmacy costs net of rebates, allocations of certain centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to members, as well as estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care and other supplemental benefits provided on or prior to the balance sheet date. For additional information regarding our benefits payable and benefits expense recognition, refer to Note 2 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. The detail of total net receivables was as follows at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021: Change 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 (in millions) Medicare $ 1,426 $ 1,260 $ 1,214 $ 166 $ 46 Commercial and other 549 383 579 166 (196) Military services 148 101 104 47 (3) Allowance for doubtful accounts (88) (70) (83) (18) 13 Total net receivables $ 2,035 $ 1,674 $ 1,814 361 (140) Reconciliation to cash flow statement: Receivables (acquired) disposed (24) 194 Change in receivables per cash flow statement $ 337 $ 54 The changes in Medicare receivables for both the 2023 period and the 2022 period reflect individual Medicare Advantage membership growth and the typical pattern caused by the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the CMS risk-adjustment model. The increase in Commercial and other receivables for the 2023 period is primarily related to Medicaid membership growth. The decrease in Commercial and other receivables for 2022 primarily relates to the Gentiva Hospice disposition. Cash Flow from Investing Activities During the 2022 period, we completed the sale of a 60% interest of Gentiva Hospice to CD&R for cash proceeds of approximately $2.7 billion , net of cash disposed, including debt repayments from Gentiva Hospice to Humana of $1.9 billion. In connection with the sale we recognized a pre-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of $237 million which was reported as a gain on sale of Gentiva Hospice in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. During the 2023 period and 2022 period, we acquired various businesses for approximately $233 million and $337 million, respectively, net of cash and cash equivalents received. During 2021, we acquired Kindred at Home and other primary care businesses for cash consideration of approximately $4.2 billion, net of cash received. Our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives, support of services in our primary care operations including medical and administrative facility improvements necessary for activities such as the provision of care to members, claims processing, billing and collections, wellness solutions, care coordination, regulatory compliance and customer service. Net capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $794 million, $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion in the 2023, 2022 and 2021 periods, respectively. 57 Net purchases of investment securities were $2.5 billion, $2.3 billion and $1.1 billion in the 2023, 2022 and 2021 periods, respectively. Cash Flow from Financing Activities Our financing cash flows are significantly impacted by the timing of claims payments and the related receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk. Monthly prospective payments from CMS for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. Settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year. Receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk were higher than claim payments by $771 million and $2 billion in the 2023 and 2022 periods, respectively, and claim payments were higher than receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk by $261 million in the 2021 period. Our net payable from CMS for subsidies and brand name prescription drug discounts was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2023 compared to a net payable of $540 million at December 31, 2022. Under our administrative services only TRICARE contract, reimbursements from the federal government exceeded health care costs payments for which we do not assume risk by $57 million and $25 million in the 2023 and 2022 periods, respectively, and health care costs payments for which we do not assume risk exceeded reimbursements from the federal government by $45 million in the 2021 period. In November 2023, we issued $500 million of 5.750% unsecured senior notes due December 1, 2028 and $850 million of 5.950% unsecured senior notes due March 15, 2034. Our net proceeds, reduced for the underwriters' discounts and commissions paid, were $1.3 billion. In March 2023, we issued $500 million of 5.700% unsecured senior notes due March 13, 2026 and $750 million of 5.500% unsecured senior notes due March 15, 2053. Our net proceeds, reduced for the underwriters' discounts and commissions paid, were $1.2 billion. We used the net proceeds to repay outstanding amounts under our $500 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, which included the repayment of existing indebtedness, including borrowings under our commercial paper program. In November 2022, we issued $500 million of 5.750% unsecured senior notes due March 1, 2028 and $750 million of 5.875% unsecured senior notes due March 1, 2033. Our net proceeds, reduced for the underwriters' discounts and commissions paid, were $1.2 billion. In March 2022, we issued $750 million of 3.700% unsecured senior notes due March 23, 2029. Our net proceeds, reduced for the underwriters' discounts and commissions paid, were $744 million. In August 2021, we issued $1.5 billion of 0.650% unsecured senior notes due August 3, 2023, $750 million of 1.350% unsecured senior notes due February 3, 2027 and $750 million of 2.150% unsecured senior notes due February 3, 2032. Our net proceeds, reduced for the underwriters' discounts and commissions paid, were $3.0 billion. In August 2023, we entered into a Rule 10b5-1 Repurchase Plan to repurchase a portion of our $750 million aggregate principal amount of 1.350% senior notes maturing in February 2027, our $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.950% senior notes maturing in March 2027, our $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.700% senior notes maturing in March 2029, and our $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes maturing in August 2029 during the period beginning on August 7, 2023 and ending on November 15, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased $339 million principal amount of these senior notes for approximately $310 million cash. In March 2023, we entered into a Rule 10b5-1 Repurchase Plan to repurchase a portion of our $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.650% senior notes maturing in August 2023 and our $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.850% senior notes maturing in October 2024 during the period beginning on March 13, 2023 and ending on July 21, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased $361 million principal amount 58 of these senior notes for approximately $358 million cash. We repaid the remaining $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of our 0.650% senior notes due on their maturity date of August 3, 2023. We repaid $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.150% senior notes due on their maturity date of December 1, 2022 and $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.900% senior notes due on their maturity date of December 15, 2022. We entered into a commercial paper program in October 2014. Net proceeds from issuance of commercial paper were $211 million in 2023 and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2023 was $3.3 billion. Net repayments from the issuance of commercial paper were $376 million in 2022 and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2022 was $1.5 billion. Net proceeds from issuance of commercial paper were $352 million in 2021 and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2021 was $1.2 billion. We received a short-term cash advance of $100 million from FHLB with certain of our marketable securities as collateral and subsequently repaid the outstanding balance in December 2023. In August 2022, we repaid the $2.0 billion October 2021 Term Loan Agreement without a prepayment penalty due. In October 2021, we entered into a $2.0 billion term loan agreement and applied the proceeds to finance the repayment in full of the outstanding assumed Kindred at Home debt. In August 2021, we borrowed $500 million under the delayed draw term loan agreement, which was used, in combination with other debt financing, to fund the approximate $5.8 billion transaction price of Gentiva Hospice. We repurchased common shares for $1.6 billion, $2.1 billion and $79 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, under share repurchase plans authorized by the Board of Directors and in connection with employee stock plans. We paid dividends to stockholders of $431 million in 2023, $392 million in 2022, and $354 million in 2021. Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity Dividends For a detailed discussion of dividends to stockholders, please refer to Note 16 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. Stock Repurchases For a detailed discussion of stock repurchases, please refer to Note 16 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. Debt For a detailed discussion of our debt, including our senior notes, term loans, credit agreement and commercial paper program, please refer to Note 13 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. Liquidity Requirements We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement and our commercial paper program or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, acquisitions, future expansion 59 opportunities, and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months, as well as to refinance or repay debt, and repurchase shares. Adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. Our investment-grade credit rating at December 31, 2023 was BBB+ according to Standard & Poor Rating Services, or S&P, and Baa2 according to Moody Investors Services, Inc., or Moody s. A downgrade by S&P to BB+ or by Moody to Ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to $250 million of our senior notes. Successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points, or annual interest expense by $1 million, up to a maximum 100 basis points, or annual interest expense by $3 million. In addition, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. Humana Inc., our parent company, is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. We continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our state-regulated operating subsidiaries. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at the parent company decreased to $0.5 billion at December 31, 2023 from $0.9 billion at December 31, 2022. This decrease primarily reflects common stock repurchases, repayment of maturing senior notes, capital expenditures, capital contributions to certain subsidiaries, cash dividends to shareholders and acquisitions, partially offset by net proceeds from the senior notes, dividends from insurance subsidiaries, and cash from certain non-insurance subsidiaries within our CenterWell segment. Our use of operating cash derived from our non-insurance subsidiaries, such as our CenterWell segment, is generally not restricted by regulators. Our regulated insurance subsidiaries paid dividends to our parent company of $1.8 billion in 2023, $1.3 billion in 2022, and $1.6 billion in 2021. Subsidiary capital requirements from significant premium growth has impacted the amount of regulated subsidiary dividends over the last two years. Refer to our parent company financial statements and accompanying notes in Schedule I - Parent Company Financial Information. The amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2024 is approximately $1.1 billion, in the aggregate. Actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to, for example, premium volume and product mix. Regulatory Requirements For a detailed discussion of our regulatory requirements, including aggregate statutory capital and surplus as well as dividends paid from the subsidiaries to our parent, please refer to Note 16 to the to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2023, we were not involved in any special purpose entity, or SPE, transactions. For a detailed discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements, please refer to Note 17 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. Guarantees and Indemnifications For a detailed discussion of our guarantees and indemnifications, please refer to Note 17 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. Government Contracts For a detailed discussion of our government contracts, including our Medicare, military services, and Medicaid and state-based contracts, please refer to Note 17 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. 60 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies primarily related to benefits expense and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities, goodwill, indefinite-lived and long-lived assets. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and, accordingly, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Benefits Expense Recognition Benefits expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported, or IBNR. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. For further discussion of our reserving methodology, including our use of completion and claims per member per month trend factors to estimate IBNR, refer to Note 2 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. The completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the IBNR estimate. The portion of IBNR estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent two months is generally less variable than the portion of IBNR estimated using trend factors. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderately adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on December 31, 2023 data: Completion Factor (a): Claims Trend Factor (b): Factor Change (c) Decrease in Benefits Payable Factor Change (c) Decrease in Benefits Payable (dollars in millions) 0.90% $707 4.50% $750 0.80% $628 4.25% $709 0.70% $550 4.00% $667 0.60% $471 3.75% $625 0.50% $393 3.50% $584 0.40% $314 3.25% $542 0.30% $236 3.00% $500 0.20% $157 2.75% $459 0.10% $79 2.50% $417 0.05% $39 2.25% $375 0.03% $20 2.00% $333 (a) Reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable at December 31, 2023 caused by changes in completion factors for incurred months prior to the most recent two months. (b) Reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable at December 31, 2023 caused by changes in annualized claims trend used for the estimation of per member per month incurred claims for the most recent two months. (c) The factor change indicated represents the percentage point change. The following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefits 61 expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. Refer to Note 11 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K for information about incurred and paid claims development as of December 31, 2023 as well as cumulative claim frequency and the total of IBNR included within the net incurred claims amounts. 2023 2022 2021 (in millions) Balances at January 1 $ 9,264 $ 8,289 $ 8,143 Acquisitions 62 42 Incurred related to: Current year 89,266 76,105 70,024 Prior years (872) (415) (825) Total incurred 88,394 75,690 69,199 Paid related to: Current year (79,545) (67,287) (62,149) Prior years (7,934) (7,428) (6,946) Total paid (87,479) (74,715) (69,095) Balances at December 31 $ 10,241 $ 9,264 $ 8,289 The following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions. As previously described, our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. The amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefits expense ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments. Favorable Development by Changes in Key Assumptions 2023 2022 2021 Amount Factor Change (a) Amount Factor Change (a) Amount Factor Change (a) (dollars in millions) Trend factors $ (586) (0.7) % $ (387) (0.6) % $ (361) (3.3) % Completion factors (286) (0.4) % (28) % (464) (0.9) % Total $ (872) $ (415) $ (825) (a) The factor change indicated represents the percentage point change. As previously discussed, our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims. Actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. We experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of $872 million in 2023, $415 million in 2022, and $825 million in 2021. The favorable medical claims reserve development for 2023, 2022, and 2021 primarily reflects the consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. The favorable development recognized in 2023 and 2021 primarily resulted from trend factors developing more favorably than originally expected as well as for 2021 completion factors developing faster than expected. The favorable development recognized in 2022 resulted primarily from completion factors remaining largely unchanged, resulting in lower overall development as compared to 2023 and 2021. Our favorable development for each of the years presented above is discussed further in Note 11 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. 62 We continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves. Because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards, there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our December 31, 2023 estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table. Revenue Recognition We generally establish one-year commercial membership contracts with employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30-day written notice. Our Medicare contracts with CMS renew annually. Our military services contracts with the federal government and certain contracts with various state Medicaid programs generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions. We receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms. We bill and collect premiums from employer groups and members in our Medicare and other individual products monthly. Changes in premium revenues resulting from the periodic changes in risk-adjustment scores derived from medical diagnoses for our membership are estimated by projecting the ultimate annual premium and recognized ratably during the year with adjustments each period to reflect changes in the ultimate premium. Premiums revenue is estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates. Premiums revenue is recognized as income in the period members are entitled to receive services, and is net of estimated uncollectible amounts, retroactive membership adjustments, and adjustments to recognize rebates under the minimum benefit ratios required under the Health Care Reform Law. We estimate policyholder rebates by projecting calendar year minimum benefit ratios for the small group and large group markets, as defined by the Health Care Reform Law using a methodology prescribed by HHS, separately by state and legal entity. Medicare Advantage products are also subject to minimum benefit ratio requirements under the Health Care Reform Law. Estimated calendar year rebates recognized ratably during the year are revised each period to reflect current experience. Retroactive membership adjustments result from enrollment changes not yet processed, or not yet reported by an employer group or the government. We routinely monitor the collectability of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, historical retroactivity trends, estimated rebates, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in current operations. Premiums received prior to the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. 63 Medicare Risk-Adjustment Provisions CMS uses a risk-adjustment model which adjusts premiums paid to Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans according to health status of covered members. The risk-adjustment model, which CMS implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), generally pays more where a plan's membership has higher expected costs. Under this model, rates paid to MA plans are based on actuarially determined bids, which include a process whereby our prospective payments are based on our estimated cost of providing standard Medicare-covered benefits to an enrollee with a "national average risk profile." That baseline payment amount is adjusted to account for certain demographic characteristics and health status of our enrolled members. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all MA plans must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The CMS risk-adjustment model uses the diagnosis data, collected from providers, to calculate the health status-related risk-adjusted premium payment to MA plans, which CMS further adjusts for coding pattern differences between the health plans and the government fee-for-service (FFS) program. We generally rely on providers, including certain providers in our network who are our employees, to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to CMS as the basis for our health status-adjusted payment received from CMS under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. We also rely on these providers to document appropriately all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims. In addition, we conduct medical record reviews as part of our data and payment accuracy compliance efforts, to more accurately reflect diagnosis conditions under the risk adjustment model.

Investment Securities Investment securities totaled $17.0 billion, or 36% of total assets at December 31, 2023, and $14.3 billion, or 33% of total assets at December 31, 2022. The investment portfolio was primarily comprised of debt securities, detailed below, at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The fair value of investment securities were as follows at December 31, 2023 and 2022: 12/31/2023 Percentage of Total 12/31/2022 Percentage of Total (dollars in millions) U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government corporations and agencies: U.S. Treasury and agency obligations $ 2,667 15.7 % $ 1,039 7.3 % Mortgage-backed securities 3,522 20.7 % 3,230 22.6 % Tax-exempt municipal securities 858 5.0 % 728 5.1 % Mortgage-backed securities: Residential 400 2.4 % 401 2.8 % Commercial 1,345 7.9 % 1,399 9.8 % Asset-backed securities 1,771 10.4 % 1,731 12.1 % Corporate debt securities 6,445 37.9 % 5,726 40.2 % Total debt securities 17,008 100.0 % 14,254 100.0 % Common stock % 7 % Total investment securities $ 17,008 100.0 % $ 14,261 100.0 % Approximately 97% of our debt securities were investment-grade quality, with a weighted average credit rating of AA- by S&P at December 31, 2023. Most of the debt securities that were below investment-grade were rated B+, the higher end of the below investment-grade rating scale. Tax-exempt municipal securities were diversified among general obligation bonds of states and local municipalities in the United States as well as special revenue bonds issued by municipalities to finance specific public works projects such as utilities, water and sewer, transportation, or education. Our general obligation bonds are diversified across the United States with no individual state 64 exceeding approximately 1% of our total debt securities. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types. Gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at December 31, 2023: Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses (in millions) U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government corporations and agencies: U.S. Treasury and agency obligations $ 1,899 $ (12) $ 431 $ (39) $ 2,330 $ (51) Mortgage-backed securities 958 (12) 2,269 (413) 3,227 (425) Tax-exempt municipal securities 160 (1) 523 (21) 683 (22) Mortgage-backed securities: Residential 373 (66) 373 (66) Commercial 18 1,303 (126) 1,321 (126) Asset-backed securities 120 (1) 1,364 (43) 1,484 (44) Corporate debt securities 466 (2) 4,783 (592) 5,249 (594) Total debt securities $ 3,621 $ (28) $ 11,046 $ (1,300) $ 14,667 $ (1,328) Under the current expected credit losses model, or CECL, expected losses on available for sale debt securities are recognized through an allowance for credit losses rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. For debt securities whose fair value is less than their amortized cost which we do not intend to sell or are not required to sell, we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if an expected credit loss has occurred. In the event of an expected credit loss, only the amount of the impairment associated with the expected credit loss is recognized in income with the remainder, if any, of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income. To the extent we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis, we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value. Potential expected credit loss impairment is considered using a variety of factors, including the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a debt security; changes in the quality of the debt security's credit enhancement; payment structure of the debt security; changes in credit rating of the debt security by the rating agencies; failure of the issuer to make scheduled principal or interest payments on the debt security and changes in prepayment speeds. For debt securities, we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data. For example, with respect to mortgage and asset-backed securities, such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements. We estimate the amount of the expected credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security. The present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase. The expected credit loss cannot exceed the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value. The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations, facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time, or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment. The determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is related to a credit event requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. The status of the general 65 economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment. There is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or expected credit loss impairments may be recorded in future periods. All issuers of debt securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at December 31, 2023 remain current on all contractual payments. After taking into account these and other factors previously described, we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates in the current markets since the time the debt securities were purchased. At December 31, 2023, we did not intend to sell any debt securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income, and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Additionally, we did not record any material credit allowances for debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021. Goodwill, Indefinite-lived and Long-lived Assets At December 31, 2023, goodwill, indefinite-lived and other long-lived assets represented 30% of total assets and 87% of total stockholders equity, compared to 33% and 92%, respectively, at December 31, 2022. The decrease in goodwill, indefinite-lived and other long-lived assets as a percentage of total assets is primarily attributable to the increase in investment securities. For goodwill, we are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit, and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. A reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments, referred to as a component, which comprise our reportable segments. A component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management. We are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition. We perform a quantitative assessment to review goodwill for impairment to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment, if any. Our strategy, long-range business plan, and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests. These tests are performed, at a minimum, annually in the fourth quarter, and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows. We rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value. However, outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness. We use discount rates that correspond to a market-based weighted-average cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to long-term growth prospects, consistent with the long-term inflation rate. Key assumptions in our cash flow projections, including changes in membership, premium yields, medical and operating cost trends, and certain government contract extensions, are consistent with those utilized in our long-range business plan and annual planning process. If these assumptions differ from actual, including the impact of the Health Care Reform Law or changes in government reimbursement rates, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. The fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a substantial margin. However, unfavorable changes in key assumptions or combinations of assumptions including a significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate or substantial reduction in our underlying cash flow assumptions, including revenue growth rates, medical and operating cost trends, and projected operating income could have a significant negative impact on the estimated fair value of our home solutions and primary care reporting units, which accounted for $4.4 billion and $1.2 billion of goodwill, respectively. Impairment tests completed for 2023, 2022, and 2021 did not result in an impairment loss. Indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to Certificate of Needs (CON) and Medicare licenses acquired in connection with our August 2021 KAH acquisition with a carrying value of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2023. Like goodwill, we are required to test at least annually for impairment and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. These tests are performed, at a minimum, annually in the fourth quarter. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment 66 loss is recognized. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on the income approach. Impairment tests completed for 2023 and 2022 did not result in material impairment losses. These charges reflect the amount by which the carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value. Impairment tests completed for 2021 did not result in an impairment loss. The fair values of the assets were measured using Level 3 inputs, such as projected revenues and operating cash flows. Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and other definite-lived intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. We periodically review long-lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long-lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets. Other than the impairment charges as described in Footnote 2 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K, there were no other impairment losses in the last three years.
