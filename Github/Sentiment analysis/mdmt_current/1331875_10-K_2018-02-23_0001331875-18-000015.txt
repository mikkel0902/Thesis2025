Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto and Selected Financial Data included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Overview For a description of our business, including descriptions of segments, see the discussion under Business in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report, which is incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report. Recent Developments On November 30, 2017, FGL Holdings (formerly known as CF Corporation), a Cayman Islands exempted company, consummated its previously announced acquisition of Fidelity & Guaranty Life, a Delaware corporation ( FGL ), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 24, 2017, as amended (the Merger Agreement ), by and among CF Corporation, FGL, and certain subsidiaries of CF Corporation and FGL (collectively, the "FGL Merger"). In connection with the FGL Merger, FNF received 13,732,000 common shares and 100,000 Series B Cumulative Preferred ('FG Preferred") shares in exchange for an aggregate investment of $213 million . As of December 31, 2017 FNF owns 16,732,000 common shares, inclusive of 3,000,000 common shares of CF Corporation held prior to the FGL Merger, and 100,000 FG Preferred shares with an aggregate market value of $246 million and we own approximately 8.5% of the outstanding common equity of FGL. The Company non-executive Chairman, William P. Foley, II, is also the Co-Executive Chairman of FGL. On November 17, 2017 we completed our previously announced split-off (the FNFV Split-Off ) of our former wholly-owned subsidiary Cannae Holdings, Inc. ( Cannae ) which consisted of the businesses, assets and liabilities formerly attributed to our FNF Ventures ("FNFV") Group including Ceridian Holding, LLC, American Blue Ribbon Holdings, LLC and T-System Holding LLC.. The FNFV Split-Off was accomplished by the Company's redemption (the Redemption ) of all of the outstanding shares of FNFV Group common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ( FNFV common stock ) for outstanding shares of common stock of Cannae, par value $0.0001 per share ( Cannae common stock ), amounting to a redemption on a per share basis of each outstanding share of FNFV common stock for one share of Cannae common stock, as of November 17, 2017. As a result of the FNFV Split-Off, Cannae is a separate, publicly traded company (NYSE: CNNE). All of the Company core title insurance, real estate, technology and mortgage related businesses, assets and liabilities currently attributed to the Company FNF Group common stock that were not held by Cannae remain with the Company. As a result of the FNFV Split-Off, we have reclassified the assets and liabilities divested as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016. Further, the financial results of FNFV Group have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. See Note G. Discontinued Operations to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for further details of the results of FNFV Group. On November 17, 2017, Frank P. Willey resigned from our Board of Directors. On September 29, 2017 we completed our tax-free distribution to FNF Group shareholders, of all 83.3 million shares of New BKH Corp. ("New BKH") common stock that we previously owned (the BK Distribution ). Immediately following the BK Distribution, New BKH and Black Knight Financial Services, Inc. ("Black Knight") engaged in a series of transactions resulting in the formation of a new publicly-traded holding company, Black Knight, Inc. ("New Black Knight"). Holders of FNF Group common stock received approximately 0.30663 shares of New Black Knight common stock for every one share of FNF Group common stock held at the close of business on September 20, 2017, the record date for the BK Distribution. New Black Knight's common stock is now listed under the symbol BKI on the New York Stock Exchange. The BK Distribution is expected to generally be tax-free to FNF Group shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except to the extent of any cash received in lieu of New Black Knight's fractional shares. As a result of the BK Distribution, we have reclassified the assets and liabilities divested as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016. Further, the financial results of Black Knight have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. See Note G. Discontinued Operations to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for further details of the results of Black Knight. On August 31, 2017, FNF Group completed its acquisition of 90% of the membership interests of Title Guaranty of Hawaii ("Title Guaranty") for $98 million . Title Guaranty was previously an unaffiliated agent of Chicago Title and will continue to be closely aligned with Chicago Title as it formally becomes part of the FNF title company family. Founded in 1896, Title Guaranty is the oldest title company in the State of Hawaii and is a leading provider of title and escrow services, with more than 300 employees in branches across the State of Hawaii providing title insurance and real estate closing services. See Note J Acquisitions for further discussion. On May 3, 2017, our Board of Directors adopted a resolution to increase the size of our Board of Directors to thirteen and elected Heather H. Murren to serve on our Board of Directors. Ms. Murren will serve in Class I of our Board of Directors, and her term will expire at the annual meeting of our shareholders to be held in 2018. In January 2018, Ms. Murren was appointed to the Audit Committee of our Board. 25 Table of Contents Effective March 1, 2017, three of the Company title insurance underwriters, Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, Chicago Title Insurance Company and Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company, redomesticated from their respective former states of domicile to Florida (the "Redomestication"). In conjunction with the Redomestication, the Company received a special dividend of $280 million from these title insurance underwriters on March 15, 2017. Business Trends and Conditions Title Our Title segment revenue is closely related to the level of real estate activity which includes sales, mortgage financing and mortgage refinancing. Declines in the level of real estate activity or the average price of real estate sales will adversely affect our title insurance revenues. We have found that residential real estate activity is generally dependent on the following factors: mortgage interest rates; mortgage funding supply; and strength of the United States economy, including employment levels. As of January 20, 2018 , the Mortgage Banker's Association ("MBA") estimated the size of the U.S. mortgage originations market as shown in the following table for 2016 - 2020 in its "Mortgage Finance Forecast" (in trillions): 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 Purchase transactions $ 1.3 $ 1.2 $ 1.2 $ 1.1 $ 1.1 Refinance transactions 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.6 1.0 Total U.S. mortgage originations $ 1.7 $ 1.6 $ 1.6 $ 1.7 $ 2.1 In 2016 and 2017, total originations were reflective of a generally improving residential real estate market driven by increasing home prices and historically low mortgage interest rates. Mortgage interest rates increased slightly in 2017 from 2016, but remained low compared to historical rates. Refinance transactions decreased in 2017 from the historically high levels experienced in recent years through 2016. Existing home sales increased and there was a decline in total housing inventory. In 2018 and beyond, increasing mortgage interest rates driven by gradual increases in the target federal funds rate are expected to adversely impact mortgage originations. In a rising interest rate environment, refinance transactions are expected to continue to decline. The MBA predicts overall mortgage originations in 2018 through 2019 will decrease compared to the 2016 and 2017 periods due to a decrease in refinance transactions, offset by a slight increase in purchase transactions. Purchase transactions involve the issuance of both a lender policy and an owner policy, resulting in higher title premiums, whereas refinance transactions only require a lender policy, resulting in lower title premiums. While projected increases in mortgage interest rates present a potential headwind for mortgage originations, other economic indicators used to measure the health of the United States economy, including the unemployment rate and consumer confidence, have improved in recent years. According to the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor, the unemployment rate has dropped from 7.4% in 2013 to 4.1% in December 2017. Additionally, the Conference Board's monthly Consumer Confidence Index rose sharply at the end of 2016 and has remained at historical highs through 2017. We believe that improvements in both of these economic indicators, among other indicators which support a generally improving United States economy, present potential tailwinds for mortgage originations and support recent home price trends. We cannot be certain how, if at all, the positive effects of a change in mix of purchase to refinance transactions and of a generally improving United States economy and the negative effects of projected decreases in overall originations and increases in interest rates will impact our future results of operations. We continually monitor origination trends and believe that, based on our ability to produce industry leading operating margins through all economic cycles, we are well positioned to adjust our operations for adverse changes in real estate activity. Because commercial real estate transactions tend to be generally driven by supply and demand for commercial space and occupancy rates in a particular area rather than by interest rate fluctuations, we believe that our commercial real estate title insurance business is less dependent on the industry cycles discussed above than our residential real estate title business. Commercial real estate transaction volume is also often linked to the availability of financing. For several years through 2015, we experienced continual year-over-year increases in the fee per file of commercial transactions. In 2016, we experienced a slight decrease in the volume and fee per file of commercial transactions as compared to 2015, but commercial markets still remained at historically elevated levels. Through 2017, we have continued to see strong demand for commercial transactions and have experienced historically high fees per file. H istorically, real estate transactions have produced seasonal revenue fluctuations in the real estate industry. The first calendar quarter is typically the weakest quarter in terms of revenue due to the generally low volume of home sales during January and February. The third calendar quarter is typically the strongest quarter in terms of revenue, primarily due to a higher volume of 26 Table of Contents home sales in the summer months. The fourth quarter is typically also strong due to the desire of commercial entities to complete transactions by year-end. We have noted short-term fluctuations through recent years in resale and refinance transactions as a result of changes in interest rates. Critical Accounting Estimates The accounting estimates described below are those we consider critical in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. See Note A Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for additional description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Reserve for Title Claim Losses. Title companies issue two types of policies, owner's and lender's policies, since both the new owner and the lender in real estate transactions want to know that their interest in the property is insured against certain title defects outlined in the policy. An owner's policy insures the buyer against such defects for as long as he or she owns the property (as well as against warranty claims arising out of the sale of the property by such owner). A lender's policy insures the priority of the lender's security interest over the claims that other parties may have in the property. The maximum amount of liability under a title insurance policy is generally the face amount of the policy plus the cost of defending the insured's title against an adverse claim; however, occasionally we do incur losses in excess of policy limits. While most non-title forms of insurance, including property and casualty, provide for the assumption of risk of loss arising out of unforeseen future events, title insurance serves to protect the policyholder from risk of loss for events that predate the issuance of the policy. Unlike many other forms of insurance, title insurance requires only a one-time premium for continuous coverage until another policy is warranted due to changes in property circumstances arising from refinance, resale, additional liens, or other events. Unless we issue the subsequent policy, we receive no notice that our exposure under our policy has ended and, as a result, we are unable to track the actual terminations of our exposures. Our reserve for title claim losses includes reserves for known claims as well as for losses that have been incurred but not yet reported to us ( IBNR ), net of recoupments. We reserve for each known claim based on our review of the estimated amount of the claim and the costs required to settle the claim. Reserves for IBNR claims are estimates that are established at the time the premium revenue is recognized and are based upon historical experience and other factors, including industry trends, claim loss history, legal environment, geographic considerations, and the types of policies written. We also reserve for losses arising from closing and disbursement functions due to fraud or operational error. The table below summarizes our reserves for known claims and incurred but not reported claims related to title insurance: December 31, 2017 % December 31, 2016 % (in millions) Known claims $ 159 10.7 % $ 166 11.2 % IBNR 1,331 89.3 1,321 88.8 Total Reserve for Title Claim Losses $ 1,490 100.0 % $ 1,487 100.0 % Although claims against title insurance policies can be reported relatively soon after the policy has been issued, claims may be reported many years later. Historically, approximately 60% of claims are paid within approximately five years of the policy being written. By their nature, claims are often complex, vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions, as well as the legal environment existing at the time of settlement of the claims. Estimating future title loss payments is difficult because of the complex nature of title claims, the long periods of time over which claims are paid, significantly varying dollar amounts of individual claims and other factors. Our process for recording our reserves for title claim losses begins with analysis of our loss provision rate. We forecast ultimate losses for each policy year based upon historical policy year loss emergence and development patterns and adjust these to reflect policy year and policy type differences which affect the timing, frequency and severity of claims. We also use a technique that relies on historical loss emergence and on a premium-based exposure measurement. The latter technique is particularly applicable to the most recent policy years, which have few reported claims relative to an expected ultimate claim volume. After considering historical claim losses, reporting patterns and current market information, and analyzing quantitative and qualitative data provided by our legal, claims and underwriting departments, we determine a loss provision rate, which is recorded as a percentage of current title premiums. This loss provision rate is set to provide for losses on current year policies, but due to development of prior years and our long claim duration, it periodically includes amounts of estimated adverse or positive development on prior years' policies. Any significant adjustments to strengthen or release loss reserves resulting from the comparison with our actuarial analysis are made in addition to this loss provision rate. At each quarter end, our recorded reserve for claim losses is initially the result of 27 Table of Contents taking the prior recorded reserve for claim losses, adding the current provision and subtracting actual paid claims, resulting in an amount that management then compares to the range of reasonable estimates provided by the actuarial calculation. We recorded our loss provision rate at 5.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and at 4.5% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 . Our average loss provision rate was 4.9% for the year-ended December 31, 2017 . Our average loss provision rate was 3.3% and 5.7% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Our loss provision rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 also included a $97 million adjustment to reduce our prior claim loss reserves. Of such annual loss provision rates, 4.5%, 5.0% and 5.2% related to losses on policies written in the current year, and the remainder related to developments on prior year policies. The decrease in the loss provision rate during 2015 through 2017, excluding a one-time adjustment included in the 2016 period, was primarily driven by continued positive development in the more recent policy years. In 2017 and 2015 , adverse development of prior year losses of $19 million or 0.4% of 2017 premium and $22 million or 0.5% of 2015 premium was accounted for in the provision rate. In 2016 , favorable development of prior year losses of $79 million or 1.7% of 2016 premium was accounted for in the provision rate. Due to the uncertainty inherent in the process and due to the judgment used by both management and our actuary, our ultimate liability may be greater or less than our carried reserves. If the recorded amount is within the actuarial range but not at the central estimate, we assess the position within the actuarial range by analysis of other factors in order to determine that the recorded amount is our best estimate. These factors, which are both qualitative and quantitative, can change from period to period, and include items such as current trends in the real estate industry (which we can assess, but for which there is a time lag in the development of the data), any adjustments from the actuarial estimates needed for the effects of unusually large or small claims, improvements in our claims management processes, and other cost saving measures. If the recorded amount is not within a reasonable range of our actuary's central estimate, we may have to record a charge or credit and reassess the loss provision rate on a go forward basis. We will continue to reassess the provision to be recorded in future periods consistent with this methodology. During the quarter ended December 31, 2016, we released excess title reserves of $97 million. The release of excess reserves was due to analysis of historical ultimate loss ratios, the reduced volatility of development of those historical ultimate loss ratios and lower policy year loss ratios in recent years. Due to the reduction in volatility of prior year ultimate loss ratios experienced at the time, we felt that actual results were more in line with our actuarial analysis and released excess reserves to bring our recorded position in line with actuarial projections. The table below presents our title insurance loss development experience for the past three years: 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Beginning balance $ 1,487 $ 1,583 $ 1,621 Change in reinsurance recoverable (4 ) (8 ) 1 Claims loss provision related to: Current year 219 236 224 Prior years (1) 19 (79 ) 22 Total title claims loss provision 238 157 246 Claims paid, net of recoupments related to: Current year (8 ) (10 ) (7 ) Prior years (223 ) (235 ) (278 ) Total title claims paid, net of recoupments (231 ) (245 ) (285 ) Ending balance $ 1,490 $ 1,487 $ 1,583 Title premiums $ 4,893 $ 4,723 $ 4,286 _____________________ (1) Reserve of $97 million released in 2016 related to improving development on prior year claim trends. 2017 2016 2015 Provision for claim losses as a percentage of title insurance premiums: Current year 4.5 % 5.0 % 5.2 % Prior years 0.4 (1.7 ) 0.5 Total provision 4.9 % 3.3 % 5.7 % 28 Table of Contents Actual claims payments consist of loss payments and claims management expenses offset by recoupments and were as follows (in millions): Loss Payments Claims Management Expenses Recoupments Net Loss Payments Year ended December 31, 2017 $ 145 $ 121 $ (35 ) $ 231 Year ended December 31, 2016 179 121 (55 ) 245 Year ended December 31, 2015 211 137 (63 ) 285 As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , our recorded reserves were $ 1,490 million and $ 1,487 million , respectively, which we determined were reasonable and represented our best estimate and these recorded amounts were within a reasonable range of the central estimates provided by our actuaries. Our recorded reserves were $30 million above the mid-point of the provided range of our actuarial estimates of $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2017 . Our recorded reserves were equal to the mid-point of the range of our actuarial estimates as of December 31, 2016 . During 2017 and 2016, payment patterns were consistent with our actuaries' and management's expectations. Also, compared to prior years we have seen a leveling off of the ultimate loss ratios in more mature policy years, particularly 2005-2008. While we still see claims opened on these policy years, the proportion of our claims inventory represented by these policy years has continued to decrease. Additionally, we continued to see positive development relating to the 2009 through 2016 policy years, which we believe is indicative of more stringent underwriting standards by us and the lending industry. Further, we have seen significant positive development in residential owner's policies due to increased payments on residential lender's policies which inherently limit the potential loss on the related owner's policy to the differential in coverage amount between the amount insured under the owner's policy and the amount paid under the residential lender's policy. Also, any residential lender's policy claim paid relating to a property that is in foreclosure negates any potential loss under an owner's policy previously issued on the property as the owner has no equity in the property. Our ending open claim inventory decreased from approximately 15,000 claims at December 31, 2016 to approximately 14,000 claims at December 31, 2017 . If actual claims loss development varies from what is currently expected and is not offset by other factors, it is possible that our recorded reserves may fall outside a reasonable range of our actuaries' central estimate, which may require additional reserve adjustments in future periods. An approximate $ 49 million increase (decrease) in our annualized provision for title claim losses would occur if our loss provision rate were 1% higher (lower), based on 2017 title premiums of $4,893 million . A 10% increase (decrease) in our reserve for title claim losses, as of December 31, 2017 , would result in an increase (decrease) in our provision for title claim losses of approximately $ 149 million. Valuation of Investments. We regularly review our investment portfolio for factors that may indicate that a decline in fair value of an investment is other-than-temporary. Some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary include: (i) our intent and need to sell the investment prior to a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value; (ii) the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; and (iii) the financial condition and prospects of the issuer. Such reviews are inherently uncertain and the value of the investment may not fully recover or may decline in future periods resulting in a realized loss. Investments are selected for analysis whenever an unrealized loss is greater than a certain threshold that we determine based on the size of our portfolio or by using other qualitative factors. Fixed maturity investments that have unrealized losses caused by interest rate movements are not at risk as we do not anticipate having the need or intent to sell prior to maturity. Unrealized losses on investments in equity securities, preferred stock and fixed maturity instruments that are susceptible to credit related declines are evaluated based on the aforementioned factors. Currently available market data is considered and estimates are made as to the duration and prospects for recovery, and the intent or ability to retain the investment until such recovery takes place. These estimates are revisited quarterly and any material degradation in the prospect for recovery will be considered in the other-than-temporary impairment analysis. We believe that our monitoring and analysis has provided for the proper recognition of other-than-temporary impairments over the past three-year period. Any change in estimate in this area will have an impact on the results of operations of the period in which a charge is taken. The fair value hierarchy established by the standard on fair value includes three levels, which are based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure the financial instruments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. 29 Table of Contents In accordance with the standard on fair value, our financial assets and liabilities that are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1. Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that we have the ability to access. Level 2. Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3. Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on model inputs that are unobservable. The following table presents our fair value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively: December 31, 2017 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (In millions) Assets: Fixed-maturity securities available for sale: U.S. government and agencies $ $ 195 $ $ 195 State and political subdivisions 391 391 Corporate debt securities 1,117 1,117 Foreign government bonds 57 57 Mortgage-backed/asset-backed securities 56 56 Preferred stock available for sale 23 296 319 Equity securities available for sale 681 681 Total assets $ 704 $ 2,112 $ $ 2,816 December 31, 2016 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (In millions) Assets: Fixed-maturity securities available for sale: U.S. government and agencies $ $ 117 $ $ 117 State and political subdivisions 615 615 Corporate debt securities 1,508 1,508 Foreign government bonds 109 109 Mortgage-backed/asset-backed securities 58 58 Preferred stock available for sale 32 283 315 Equity securities available for sale 386 386 Total assets $ 418 $ 2,690 $ $ 3,108 Our Level 2 fair value measures for preferred stock and fixed-maturity securities available for sale are provided by a third-party pricing service. We utilize one firm for our preferred stock and our bond portfolios. The pricing service is a leading global provider of financial market data, analytics and related services to financial institutions. We rely on one price for each instrument to determine the carrying amount of the assets on our balance sheet. The inputs utilized in these pricing methodologies include observable measures such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research publications. We review the pricing methodologies for all of our Level 2 securities by obtaining an understanding of the valuation models and assumptions used by the third-party as well as independently comparing the resulting prices to other publicly available measures of fair value and internally developed models. The pricing methodologies used by the relevant third party pricing services are as follows: U.S. government and agencies: These securities are valued based on data obtained for similar securities in active markets and from inter-dealer brokers. 30 Table of Contents State and political subdivisions: These securities are valued based on data obtained for similar securities in active markets and from inter-dealer brokers. Factors considered include relevant trade information, dealer quotes and other relevant market data. Corporate debt securities: These securities are valued based on dealer quotes and related market trading activity. Factors considered include the bond's yield, its terms and conditions, or any other feature which may influence its risk and thus marketability, as well as relative credit information and relevant sector news. Foreign government bonds: These securities are valued based on a discounted cash flow model incorporating observable market inputs such as available broker quotes and yields of comparable securities. Mortgage-backed/asset-backed securities: These securities are comprised of commercial mortgage-backed securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, and asset-backed securities. They are valued based on available trade information, dealer quotes, cash flows, relevant indices and market data for similar assets in active markets. Preferred stock: Preferred stocks are valued by calculating the appropriate spread over a comparable US Treasury security. Inputs include benchmark quotes and other relevant market data. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 we held no material assets nor liabilities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs. During the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we incurred impairment charges relating to investments that were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired of $1 million , $19 million , and $14 million , respectively. Refer to Note D. Investments to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Part II of this Report for further discussion. Included in our Investments as of December 31, 2017 are various holdings in foreign securities as follows (in millions): Carrying Value Cost Basis Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Market Value (In millions) Available for sale securities: Australia $ 22 $ 22 $ $ 22 Belgium 14 14 14 Cayman Islands 171 167 4 171 Canada 61 62 1 (2 ) 61 China 6 6 6 France 9 9 9 Germany 50 50 50 Ireland 28 28 28 Japan 49 49 49 Norway 1 1 1 New Zealand 17 17 17 Switzerland 6 6 6 United Kingdom 24 24 24 Total $ 458 $ 455 $ 5 $ (2 ) $ 458 We have reviewed all of these securities as of December 31, 2017 and do not believe that there is a risk of significant credit loss as these securities are in a gross unrealized gain position of $5 million and a gross unrealized loss position of $2 million . We held no European sovereign debt at December 31, 2017 . Goodwill. We have made acquisitions that have resulted in a significant amount of goodwill. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , goodwill aggregated was $ 2,746 million and $ 2,555 million, respectively. The majority of our goodwill as of December 31, 2017 relates to goodwill recorded in connection with the Chicago Title merger in 2000 and our acquisition of ServiceLink in 2014. Refer to Note F Goodwill to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for a summary of recent changes in our Goodwill balance. In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our recorded goodwill exceeds its carrying value. Based on the results of this analysis, an annual goodwill impairment test may be completed based on an analysis of the discounted future cash flows generated by the underlying assets. The process of determining whether or not goodwill is impaired or recoverable relies on projections of future cash flows, operating results and market conditions. Future cash flow estimates are based partly on projections of market conditions such as the volume and mix of refinance and purchase transactions and interest rates, which are beyond our control and are likely to fluctuate. While 31 Table of Contents we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, these estimates are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from what is assumed in our impairment tests. Such analyses are particularly sensitive to changes in estimates of future cash flows and discount rates. Changes to these estimates might result in material changes in fair value and determination of the recoverability of goodwill, which may result in charges against earnings and a reduction in the carrying value of our goodwill in the future.We have completed our annual goodwill impairment analysis in each of the past three years and as a result, no impairment charges were recorded to goodwill in 2017 , 2016 , or 2015 . As of December 31, 2017 , we have determined that our goodwill has a fair value which substantially exceeds its carrying value. Other Intangible Assets. We have other intangible assets, not including goodwill, which consist primarily of customer relationships and contracts, trademarks and tradenames, and computer software, which are generally recorded in connection with acquisitions at their fair value. Intangible assets with estimable lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In general, customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated method which takes into consideration expected customer attrition rates. Contractual relationships are generally amortized over their contractual life. Trademarks and tradenames are generally amortized over 10 years. Capitalized software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations, purchased software and capitalized software development costs. Purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. Software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straight-line or accelerated methods over its estimated useful life, ranging from 5 to 10 years. For internal-use computer software products, internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as they are incurred. Internal and external costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and amortized on a product by product basis commencing on the date the software is ready for its intended use. We do not capitalize any costs once the software is ready for its intended use. We recorded $1 million in impairment expense to other intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 . The impairment in 2017 was for computer software at ServiceLink. The impairment in 2016 was for customer relationships and tradenames at our real estate subsidiaries in our Corporate and Other segment. We recorded no impairment expense related to other intangible assets in the year ended December 31, 2015 . Title Revenue Recognition. Our direct title insurance premiums and escrow, title-related and other fees are recognized as revenue at the time of closing of the related transaction as the earnings process is then considered complete. Premium revenues from agency operations and agency commissions include an accrual based on estimates using historical information of the volume of transactions that have closed in a particular period for which premiums have not yet been reported to us. The accrual for agency premiums is necessary because of the lag between the closing of these transactions and the reporting of these policies to us by the agent. Historically, the time lag between the closing of these transactions by our agents and the reporting of these policies, or premiums, to us has been up to 15 months, with 84 - 88% reported within three months following closing, an additional 9 - 12% reported within the next three months and the remainder within seven to fifteen months. In addition to accruing these earned but unreported agency premiums, we also accrue agent commission expense, which was 76.7% of agent premiums earned in 2017 , 76.1% of agent premiums earned in 2016 , and 76.0% of agent premiums earned in 2015 . We also record a provision for claim losses at the provision rate at the time we record the accrual for the premiums, which averaged 4.9% for 2017 , 5.4% , excluding the release of excess reserves relating to prior years of $97 million , for 2016 , and 5.7% for 2015 and accruals for premium taxes and other expenses relating to our premium accrual. The resulting impact to pretax earnings in any period is approximately 11% or less of the accrued premium amount. The impact of the change in the accrual for agency premiums and related expenses on our pretax earnings was an increase of $ 1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 , an increase of $ 4 million for the year ended 2016 and a decrease of $ 5 million for the year ended 2015 . The amount due from our agents relating to this accrual, i.e., the agent premium less their contractual retained commission, was approximately $ 55 million and $ 53 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, which represents agency premiums of approximately $ 280 million and $ 267 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and agent commissions of $ 225 million and $ 214 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. We may have changes in our accrual for agency revenue in the future if additional relevant information becomes available. Accounting for Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we must reflect this increase as expense within Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Determination of income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve. Further, the estimated level of annual pre-tax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period. We believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we adequately provide for any known tax contingencies. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are 32 Table of Contents reasonable. Final determination of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period that determination is made. Refer to Note K Income Taxes t o our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for discussion of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform") in December 2017 and the related impact on our accounting for income taxes. Certain Factors Affecting Comparability Year ended December 31, 2017. As a result of the BK Distribution and the FNFV Split-Off, we have reclassified the results of operations of Black Knight and FNFV to discontinued operations for all periods presented. See discussion under 'Recent Developments' above and Note G Discontinued Operations to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report, which is incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report for further information on the results of Black Knight and FNFV. 33 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Net earnings. The following table presents certain financial data for the years indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (Dollars in millions) Revenue: Direct title insurance premiums $ 2,170 $ 2,097 $ 2,009 Agency title insurance premiums 2,723 2,626 2,277 Escrow, title-related and other fees 2,637 2,416 2,246 Interest and investment income 131 126 121 Realized gains and losses, net 2 (8 ) 11 Total revenue 7,663 7,257 6,664 Expenses: Personnel costs 2,460 2,275 2,137 Agent commissions 2,089 1,998 1,731 Other operating expenses 1,781 1,648 1,557 Depreciation and amortization 183 160 150 Provision for title claim losses 238 157 246 Interest expense 48 64 73 Total expenses 6,799 6,302 5,894 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 864 955 770 Income tax expense 235 347 274 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 10 14 5 Net earnings from continuing operations $ 639 $ 622 $ 501 Revenues. Total revenue in 2017 increased $406 million compared to 2016 , primarily due to an increase in fee per file offset by a decrease in closed order volumes in our direct title business and an increase in agent remittances . Total revenue in 2016 increased $593 million compared to 2015 , primarily due to an increase in closed order volumes in our direct title business and increases in agent remittances. Total net earnings from continuing operations increased $17 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared to the 2016 period and increased $ 121 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared to the 2015 period. The change in revenue and net earnings is discussed in further detail at the segment level below. Interest and investmen t income levels are primarily a function of securities markets, interest rates and the amount of cash available for investment. Interest and investment income was $131 million , $126 million , and $121 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily attributable to increased yield on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and an increase in other investment income, offset by a decrease in income from our fixed maturity holdings resulting from a decrease in average invested assets. The increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily attributable to increased yield on our fixed maturity holdings and increased dividend income on our equity and preferred securities, offset by a decrease in average invested assets. The effective return on average invested assets, excluding realized gains and losses, was 4.2% , 3.6% , and 3.4% for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively. Net realized gains (losses) totaled $2 million , $(8) million , and $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively. Net realized gains for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a gain of $9 million on the sale of an other long term investment and a gain of $2 million related to the sale of fixed assets, offset by losses of $6 million on redemptions of convertible debt, net losses on sales and impairment of available for sale investments of $1 million, and $2 million of other miscellaneous losses. The net realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $12 million for net gains on sales of available for sale investments, a gain of $2 million related to the favorable outcome of litigation, and $1 million for other individually insignificant gains. The gains were more than offset by losses of $13 million on impairments of available for sale investments, $3 million for impairment of an equity method investment, $4 million for losses on disposal of fixed assets, a $1 million loss related to the impairments of other intangible assets, and $2 million in realized losses related to other individually insignificant items. 34 Table of Contents The net realized gain for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes a net realized gain of $1 million on our investment portfolio, net realized gains of $16 million due to favorable settlement of litigation, and $6 million of miscellaneous other net realized losses. Expenses. Our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs; other operating expenses, which in our title business are incurred as orders are received and processed; and agent commissions, which are incurred as revenue is recognized. Title insurance premiums, escrow and title-related fees are generally recognized as income at the time the underlying transaction closes or other service is provided. Direct title operations revenue often lags approximately 45-60 days behind expenses and therefore gross margins may fluctuate. The changes in the market environment, mix of business between direct and agency operations and the contributions from our various business units have historically impacted margins and net earnings. We have implemented programs and have taken necessary actions to maintain expense levels consistent with revenue streams. However, a short time lag exists in reducing variable costs and certain fixed costs are incurred regardless of revenue levels. Personnel costs include base salaries, commissions, benefits, stock-based compensation and bonuses paid to employees, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. Agent commissions represent the portion of premiums retained by our third-party agents pursuant to the terms of their respective agency contracts. Other operating expenses consist primarily of facilities expenses, title plant maintenance, premium taxes (which insurance underwriters are required to pay on title premiums in lieu of franchise and other state taxes), appraisal fees and other cost of sales on ServiceLink product offerings and other title-related products, postage and courier services, computer services, professional services, travel expenses, general insurance, and bad debt expense on our trade and notes receivable. The provision for title claim losses includes an estimate of anticipated title and title-related claims, and escrow losses. The change in expenses is discussed in further detail at the segment level below. Income tax expense was $235 million , $347 million , and $274 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 was 27.2% , 36.3% , and 35.6% , respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017 from 2016 is primarily attributable to Tax Reform as described in Note K Income Taxes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of of Part II of this Annual Report. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2016 from 2015 is primarily related to lower tax exempt interest income, tax credits and an increase in non-deductible expenses. The fluctuation in income tax expense as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes is attributable to our estimate of ultimate income tax liability and changes in the characteristics of net earnings year to year, such as the weighting of operating income versus investment income. 35 Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations Title The following table presents the results of our Title segment for the years indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Revenues: Direct title insurance premiums $ 2,170 $ 2,097 $ 2,009 Agency title insurance premiums 2,723 2,626 2,277 Escrow, title-related and other fees 2,181 2,128 2,005 Interest and investment income 131 127 123 Realized gains and losses, net 6 14 Total revenue 7,211 6,978 6,428 Expenses: Personnel costs 2,366 2,214 2,090 Other operating expenses 1,404 1,436 1,381 Agent commissions 2,089 1,998 1,731 Depreciation and amortization 159 148 144 Provision for title claim losses 238 157 246 Total expenses 6,256 5,953 5,592 Earnings before income taxes $ 955 $ 1,025 $ 836 Orders opened by direct title operations (in 000's) 1,942 2,184 2,092 Orders closed by direct title operations (in 000's) 1,428 1,575 1,472 Total revenues in 2017 increased $233 million or 3% compared to 2016 . Total revenues in 2016 increased $550 million or 9% compared to 2015 . The increase in the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to increases in both our direct and agency title insurance premiums and growth and acquisitions in our Corporate and Other segment.The increase in the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to improvements in the overall real estate markets driving increases in closed order volumes, increased remittances from agents, and revenue associated with acquisitions. The following table presents the percentages of title insurance premiums generated by our direct and agency operations: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Amount % Amount % Amount % (Dollars in millions) Title premiums from direct operations $ 2,170 44.3 % $ 2,097 44.4 % $ 2,009 46.9 % Title premiums from agency operations 2,723 55.7 2,626 55.6 2,277 53.1 Total title premiums $ 4,893 100.0 % $ 4,723 100.0 % $ 4,286 100.0 % Title premiums increased 4% in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the 2016 period. The increase was a result of an increase in premiums from direct operations of $73 million , or 3% and an increase in premiums from agency operations of $97 million , or 4% . Title premiums increased 10% in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the 2015 period. The increase was the result of an increase in premiums from direct operations of $88 million , or 4% , and an increase in premiums from agency operations of $349 million , or 15% . 36 Table of Contents The following table presents the percentages of opened and closed title insurance orders generated by purchase and refinance transactions by our direct operations: Year ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Opened title insurance orders from purchase transactions (1) 63.1 % 53.5 % 54.0 % Opened title insurance orders from refinance transactions (1) 36.9 46.5 46.0 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Closed title insurance orders from purchase transactions (1) 62.8 % 54.1 % 54.5 % Closed title insurance orders from refinance transactions (1) 37.2 45.9 45.5 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % _______________________________________ (1) Percentages exclude consideration of an immaterial number of non-purchase and non-refinance orders. Title premiums from direct operations increased in 2017 , primarily due to an increase in the average fee per file, offset by a decrease in closed order volumes as compared to the prior year. Closed order volumes were 1,428,000 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with 1,575,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016 . This represented a decrease of 9% . The decrease in closed order volumes was primarily related to a decrease in refinance transactions, offset by an increase in purchase transactions in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the 2016 period. The average fee per file in our direct operations was $2,346 and $2,065 in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The increase in average fee per file year over year reflects an increase in the average fee per file in both commercial and residential transactions. The increase in average fee per file from residential transactions is driven by an increase in purchase transactions and decrease in refinance transactions. The residential fee per file tends to change as the mix of refinance and purchase transactions changes, because purchase transactions involve the issuance of both a lender policy and an owner policy, resulting in higher fees, whereas refinance transactions only require a lender policy, resulting in lower fees. The increase in title premiums from agency operations is primarily the result of an increase in remitted agency premiums that reflects an improving residential purchase environment in many markets throughout the country. The increase also reflects a concerted effort by management to increase remittances with existing agents as well as cultivate new relationships with potential new agents while reducing unprofitable agency relationships. Escrow, title-related and other fees increased by $53 million , or 2% , in the year ended December 31, 2017 from the 2016 period. Escrow fees, which are more directly related to our direct operations, increased $21 million, or 3%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the 2016 period. The increase is primarily driven by the related increase in direct title premiums. Other fees in the Title segment, excluding escrow fees, increased $30 million, or 2%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the 2016 period. The increase in other fees was primarily attributable to revenue growth associated with our home warranty businesses and increased servicing revenue at ServiceLink, offset by decreases at certain other ServiceLink subsidiaries. Escrow, title related and other fees increased by $123 million , or 6% , in the year ended December 31, 2016 from the 2015 period. Escrow fees, which are more directly related to our direct operations, increased $102 million, or 15%, in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the 2015 period. The increase is consistent with the increase in direct title premiums. Other fees in the Title segment, excluding escrow fees, increased $21 million, or 1%, in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the 2015 period. The increase in other fees was primarily attributable to revenue growth associated with our home warranty businesses as well as acquisitions. Interest and investment income levels are primarily a function of securities markets, interest rates and the amount of cash available for investment. Interest and investment income increased $4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the 2016 period and increased $4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the 2015 period. Personnel costs include base salaries, commissions, benefits, stock-based compensation and bonuses paid to employees, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. The $152 million , or 7% increase in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the 2016 period is directionally consistent with and primarily attributable to the increase in revenue. The $124 million , or 6% increase in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the 2015 period is primarily related to additional expense associated with the increased order volumes and acquisitions in 2016. Personnel costs as a percentage of total revenues from direct title premiums and escrow, title-related and other fees was 54% and 52% for years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The increase in the 2017 period is primarily attributable to the increase in order volumes from purchase transactions, acquisitions, and the realignment of Property Insight in January 2017 which resulted in increased personnel costs offset by reduced 37 Table of Contents other operating expenses. Average employee count in the Title segment was 23,245 and 21,999 in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Other operating expenses decreased $32 million , or 2% , in the year ended December 31, 2017 from the corresponding 2016 period. The decrease in the 2017 period is primarily attributable to the realignment of Property Insight in January 2017 and a reduction in operating expenses at certain ServiceLink subsidiaries. Other operating expenses increased $55 million , or 4% in the year ended December 31, 2016 from the corresponding 2015 period. Other operating expenses increased consistently with the increase in direct title premiums and escrow, title-related and other fee income offset by other miscellaneous cost reductions. Agent commissions represent the portion of premiums retained by agents pursuant to the terms of their respective agency contracts. Agent commissions and the resulting percentage of agent premiums we retain vary according to regional differences in real estate closing practices and state regulations. The following table illustrates the relationship of agent title premiums and agent commissions: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Amount % Amount % Amount % (Dollars in millions) Agent title premiums $ 2,723 100.0 % $ 2,626 100.0 % $ 2,277 100.0 % Agent commissions 2,089 76.7 1,998 76.1 1,731 76.0 Net retained agent premiums $ 634 23.3 % $ 628 23.9 % $ 546 24.0 % Net margin from agency title insurance premiums retained as a percentage of total agency premiums in the year ended December 31, 2017 remained relatively consistent with the 2016 and 2015 periods, with the slight decrease attributable to new agents signed in the current year. The provision for title claim losses includes an estimate of anticipated title and title-related claims and escrow losses. T he estimate of anticipated title and title-related claims is accrued as a percentage of title premium revenue based on our historical loss experience and other relevant factors. Any significant adjustments to strengthen or release loss reserves resulting from the comparison with our actuarial analysis are made in addition to this loss provision rate. After considering historical claim losses, reporting patterns and current market information, and analyzing quantitative and qualitative data provided by our legal, claims and underwriting departments, we determine a loss provision rate, which is recorded as a percentage of current title premiums. This loss provision rate is set to provide for losses on current year policies, but due to development of prior years and our long claim duration, it periodically includes amounts of estimated adverse or positive development on prior years' policies. Effective October 1, 2017, we revised our loss provision rate to 4.5% from 5%. Effective October 1, 2016, we revised our loss provision rate to 5.0% from 5.5%. Effective July 1, 2015, we revised our loss provision rate to 5.5% from 6%. All revisions were attributable to favorable development on more recent policy year claims. The claim loss provision for title insurance was $238 million , $157 million , and $246 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively. These amounts reflected average claim loss provision rates of 4.9% for 2017 , 3.3% for 2016 , and 5.7% of title premiums for 2015 . The decrease in the provision in 2016 reflects the release of excess title reserves of $97 million as well as the reduction in the loss provision rate from 5.5% to 5.0% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The release of excess reserves and change in provision rate was due to analysis of historical ultimate loss ratios, the reduced volatility of development of those historical ultimate loss ratios and lower policy year loss ratios in recent years. We will continue to monitor and evaluate our loss provision level, actual claims paid, and the loss reserve position each quarter. 38 Table of Contents Corporate and Other The following table presents the results of our Corporate and Other segment for the years indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Revenues: Escrow, title-related and other fees $ 456 $ 288 $ 241 Interest and investment income (1 ) (2 ) Realized gains and losses, net (4 ) (8 ) (3 ) Total revenue 452 279 236 Expenses: Personnel costs 94 61 47 Other operating expenses 377 212 176 Depreciation and amortization 24 12 6 Interest expense 48 64 73 Total expenses 543 349 302 Earnings before income taxes $ (91 ) $ (70 ) $ (66 ) The Corporate and Other segment consists of the operations of the parent holding company, our various real estate brokerage businesses, and CINC. This segment also includes certain other unallocated corporate overhead expenses and eliminations of revenues and expenses between it and our Title segment. Total revenue in our Corporate and Other segment increased $173 million , or 62% , in the year ended December 31, 2017 from the corresponding period in 2016 and increased $43 million , or 18% , in the year ended December 31, 2016 from the corresponding period in 2015 . The increase in 2017 is primarily driven by revenue growth of $111 million at our real estate brokerage companies and $53 million at our real estate technology companies, which included $9 million total from the acquisitions of Real Geeks and SkySlope acquired in September and October 2017, respectively. Revenue in 2017 also includes $15 million related to recording one additional month of results of operations for our real estate brokerages in order to catch up their results which were previously recorded on a one month lag. The increase in the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by growth at our real estate brokerage companies and the acquisition of CINC. Revenue in the 2016 period included $19 million in revenue from CINC which represented 4 months of activity. Personnel costs increased $33 million , or 54% , in the year ended December 31, 2017 from the corresponding period in 2016 and increased $14 million or 30% in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the corresponding 2015 period. The increase in both periods is primarily driven by acquisitions. Other operating expenses increased $165 million , or 78% in the year ended December 31, 2017 from the 2016 period and increased $36 million , or 20% in the year ended December 31, 2016 from the 2015 period. The increase in the 2017 period from 2016 is primarily attributable to current period acquisitions and increased operating expense associated with higher revenue. Other operating expenses in 2017 also includes $14 million related to recording one additional month results of operations for our real estate brokerages in order to catch up their results which were previously recorded on a one month lag and $17 million related to expenses incurred related to services received from Black Knight that no longer eliminate after the BK Distribution. The increase in the 2016 period from 2015 is primarily attributable to growth of our real estate subsidiaries and current period acquisitions. Interest expense decreased $16 million , or 25% , in the year ended December 31, 2017 from the corresponding period in 2016 and decreased $9 million or 12% in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the corresponding 2015 period. The decrease in the 2017 period is primarily attributable to decreased interest on our convertible Notes resulting from redemptions in the current year. The decrease in the 2016 period is primarily attributable to the payoff of the FNF term loan in May 2015 upon the initial public offering of Black Knight. Discontinued Operations As a result of the FNFV Split-off and BK Distribution, the results of operations of FNFV and Black Knight are included in discontinued operations. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, were $155 million , $70 million , and $60 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in the 2017 period from the corresponding period in 2016 is primarily attributable to FNFV's realized gain on the sale of a subsidiary in the 2017 period. Refer to Note G Discontinued 39 Table of Contents Operations to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for further information, including a breakout of the results of operations of both FNFV and Black Knight. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Requirements. Our current cash requirements include personnel costs; operating expenses; claim payments; taxes; payments of interest and principal on our debt, including any premiums thereon, if any; capital expenditures; business acquisitions; stock repurchases and dividends on our common stock. We paid dividends of $ 1.02 per share during 2017 , or approximately $ 278 million. On January 26, 2018 , our Board of Directors formally declared a $0.30 per share cash dividend that is payable on March 30, 2018 to FNF Group shareholders of record as of March 16, 2018 . There are no restrictions on our retained earnings regarding our ability to pay dividends to shareholders, although there are limits on the ability of certain subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, as described below. The declaration of any future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Additional uses of cash flow are expected to include stock repurchases, acquisitions, and debt repayments. We continually assess our capital allocation strategy, including decisions relating to the amount of our dividend, reducing debt, repurchasing our stock, and/or conserving cash. We believe that all anticipated cash requirements for current operations will be met from internally generated funds, through cash dividends from subsidiaries, cash generated by investment securities, potential sales of non-strategic assets, and borrowings on existing credit facilities. Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are monitored regularly to ensure that we can meet our cash requirements. We forecast the needs of all of our subsidiaries and periodically review their short-term and long-term projected sources and uses of funds, as well as the asset, liability, investment and cash flow assumptions underlying such forecasts. Our insurance subsidiaries generate cash from premiums earned and their respective investment portfolios and these funds are adequate to satisfy the payments of claims and other liabilities. Due to the magnitude of our investment portfolio in relation to our claims loss reserves, we do not specifically match durations of our investments to the cash outflows required to pay claims, but do manage outflows on a shorter time frame. Our two significant sources of internally generated funds are dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries. As a holding company, we receive cash from our subsidiaries in the form of dividends and as reimbursement for operating and other administrative expenses we incur. The reimbursements are paid within the guidelines of management agreements among us and our subsidiaries. Our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by state regulation in their ability to pay dividends and make distributions. Each state of domicile regulates the extent to which our title underwriters can pay dividends or make distributions. As of December 31, 2017 , $1,700 million of our net assets were restricted from dividend payments without prior approval from the relevant departments of insurance. During 2018 , our title insurance subsidiaries can pay or make distributions to us of approximately $363 million. Our underwritten title companies and non-ti tle insurance subsidiaries collect revenue and pay operating expenses. However, they are not regulated to the same extent as our insurance subsidiaries. The maximum dividend permitted by law is not necessarily indicative of an insurer actual ability to pay dividends, which may be constrained by business and regulatory considerations, such as the impact of dividends on surplus, which could affect an insurer ratings or competitive position, the amount of premiums that can be written and the ability to pay future dividends. Further, depending on business and regulatory conditions, we may in the future need to retain cash in our underwriters or even contribute cash to one or more of them in order to maintain their ratings or their statutory capital position. Such a requirement could be the result of investment losses, reserve charges, adverse operating conditions in the current economic environment or changes in interpretation of statutory accounting requirements by regulators. Cash flow from FNF's operations is expected to be used for general corporate purposes including to reinvest in operations, repay debt, pay dividends, repurchase stock, other strategic initiatives or conserving cash. Operating Cash Flow . Our cash flows provided by oper ations for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 were $737 million , $1,162 million and $951 million , respectively, inclusive of discontinued operations. Operating cash flows from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 were $106 million, $407 million, and $277 million, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operations of $425 million in the 2017 period from the 2016 period is primarily attributable to increased cash payments for taxes of $161 million and increased realized gains on sales of investments and assets which are included in earnings of $256 million, but which related to investing activities, in the 2017 period. The increase in cash provided by operations of $211 million in the 2016 period from the 2015 period is primarily attributable to increased earnings from operations before equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $123 million (inclusive of discontinued operations), lower claims payments of $40 million, and lower payments in the 2016 period under our executive investment success bonus program of $27 million, offset by increased payments for income taxes in 2016 compared to 2015 of $118 million. The remaining change in the 2016 period from the 2015 period is attributable to timing of receivables and payables. 40 Table of Contents Investing Cash Flows. Our cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 were $95 million , $254 million and $571 million , respectively, inclusive of discontinued operations. Cash (used in) provided by investing activities from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 were $(57) million, $(163) million, and $63 million, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities of $159 million in the 2017 period from the 2016 period is primarily attributable to the $325 million in proceeds from the sale of a subsidiary by FNFV prior to the FNFV Split-Off, lower cash paid for acquisitions of $75 million and decreased capital expenditures of $141 million, offset by a $380 million decrease in net inflows from the sales and distributions of and from equity and fixed income investments, net of purchases and additional investments in unconsolidated investees. The decrease in cash used in investing activities of $317 million in the 2016 period from the 2015 period is primarily attributable to a $860 million increase in net cash inflows from the sales and distributions of and from equity and fixed income investments, net of purchases and additional investments in unconsolidated investees, offset by a $502 million increase in net cash used for acquisitions and dispositions and increased capital expenditures. Capital Expenditures. Total capital expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized software were $149 million , $290 million and $241 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively. The 2017 period consists of capital expenditures of $74 million related to our continuing operations, primarily our Title segment, and $75 million related to discontinued operations. The decrease in the 2017 period from the 2016 period is primarily attributable to the purchase of our corporate headquarters for $71 million in the second quarter of 2016. Financing Cash Flows. Our cash used in financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 were $999 million , $588 million and $272 million , respectively, inclusive of discontinued operations. The increase in cash used in financing activities of $411 million in the 2017 period from the 2016 period is primarily attributable to increased net debt service activity of $143 million, cash transferred in the FNFV Split-off and BK Distribution of $109 million, an increase in dividends paid of $39 million, payment of premiums to repurchase convertible Notes of $317 million, and repurchases of BKFS stock by Black Knight of $47 million in the 2017 period prior to the BK Distribution, offset by a reduction in spending on treasury stock repurchases of $253 million. The increase in cash used in financing activities of $316 million in the 2016 period from the 2015 period was primarily attributable to proceeds received from the IPO of Black Knight of $475 million in the 2015 period and increased net debt service activity of $69 million in the 2016 period, offset by a reduction in treasury stock repurchases in 2016 of $222 million. Financing. For a description of our financing arrangements see Note J Notes Payable to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report, which is incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 7. Seasonality. H istorically, real estate transactions have produced seasonal revenue levels for the real estate industry including title insurers. The first calendar quarter is typically the weakest quarter in terms of revenue due to the generally low volume of home sales during January and February. The third calendar quarter has been typically the strongest in terms of revenue primarily due to a higher volume of home sales in the summer months and the fourth quarter is usually also strong due to commercial entities desiring to complete transactions by year-end. We have noted short term fluctuations through recent years in resale and refinance transactions as a result of changes in interest rates. Contractual Obligations. Our long term contractual obligations generally include our loss reserves, our credit agreements and other debt facilities and operating lease payments on certain of our premises and equipment. As of December 31, 2017 , our required annual payments relating to these contractual obligations were as follows: 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter Total (In millions) Notes payable $ 66 $ $ 1 $ $ 700 $ $ 767 Operating lease payments 150 127 98 71 46 44 536 Pension and other benefit payments 18 16 16 15 14 99 178 Title claim losses 230 218 174 149 96 623 1,490 Interest on fixed rate notes payable 25 22 22 22 15 106 Total $ 489 $ 383 $ 311 $ 257 $ 871 $ 766 $ 3,077 As of December 31, 2017 , we had title insurance reserves of $1,490 million . The amounts and timing of these obligations are estimated and are not set contractually. While we believe that historical loss payments are a reasonable source for projecting future claim payments, there is significant inherent uncertainty in this payment pattern estimate because of the potential impact of changes in: future mortgage interest rates, which will affect the number of real estate and refinancing transactions and, therefore, the rate at which title insurance claims will emerge; 41 Table of Contents the legal environment whereby court decisions and reinterpretations of title insurance policy language to broaden coverage could increase total obligations and influence claim payout patterns; events such as fraud, escrow theft, multiple property title defects, foreclosure rates and individual large loss events that can substantially and unexpectedly cause increases in both the amount and timing of estimated title insurance loss payments; and loss cost trends whereby increases or decreases in inflationary factors (including the value of real estate) will influence the ultimate amount of title insurance loss payments. Based on historical title insurance claim experience, we anticipate the above payment patterns. The uncertainty and variation in the timing and amount of claim payments could have a material impact on our cash flows from operations in a particular period. We sponsor multiple pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans. See Note O. Employee Benefit Plans to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for further information. Capital Stock Transactions. On July 20, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a new three -year stock repurchase program under which we can purchase up to 25 million shares of our FNF Group common stock through July 30, 2018. We may make repurchases from time to time in the open market, in block purchases or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions and other factors. Since the original commencement of the plan, we have repurchased a total of 10,589,000 FNF common shares for $372 million , or an average of $35.10 per share, and there are 14,411,000 shares available to be repurchased under this program. We have not made any repurchases under this program in the year ended December 31, 2017 or in the subsequent period ended January 31, 2018. Equity Security and Preferred Stock Investments. Our equity security and preferred stock investments may be subject to significant volatility. Should the fair value of these investments fall below our cost basis and/or the financial condition or prospects of these companies deteriorate, we may determine in a future period that this decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, requiring that an impairment loss be recognized in the period such a determination is made. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We do not engage in off-balance sheet activities other than our escrow operations. In conducting our operations, we routinely hold customers assets in escrow, pending completion of real estate transactions, and are responsible for the proper disposition of these balances for our customers. Certain of these amounts are maintained in segregated bank accounts and have not been included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and industry practice. These balances amounted to $ 15.4 billion and $14.0 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. As a result of holding these customers assets in escrow, we have ongoing programs for realizing economic benefits during the year through favorable borrowing and vendor arrangements with various banks.
