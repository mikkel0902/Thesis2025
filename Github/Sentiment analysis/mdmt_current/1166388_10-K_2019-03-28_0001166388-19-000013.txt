Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Business under Item 1, Selected Financial Data under Item 6, and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included under Item 8 of this report. This discussion contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and all of which could be affected by uncertainties and risks. Our actual results may differ materially from the results contemplated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors including, but not limited to, those described in Risk Factors under Item 1A of this report. Overview Our Business Verint is a global leader in Actionable Intelligence solutions. In a world of massive information growth, our solutions empower organizations with crucial, actionable insights and enable decision makers to anticipate, respond, and take action. Today, over 10,000 organizations in more than 180 countries, including over 85 percent of the Fortune 100, use Verint Actionable Intelligence solutions, deployed in the cloud and on premises, to make more informed, timely, and effective decisions. Our Actionable Intelligence leadership is powered by innovative, enterprise-class software built with artificial intelligence, analytics, automation, and deep domain expertise established by working closely with some of the most sophisticated and forward-thinking organizations in the world. We believe we have one of the industry strongest R&D teams focused on actionable intelligence consisting of 1,900 professionals. Our innovative solutions are backed-up by a strong IP portfolio with close to 1,000 patents and patent applications worldwide across data capture, artificial intelligence, unstructured data analytics, predictive analytics and automation. Verint Actionable Intelligence strategy is focused on two use cases and the company has two operating segments: Customer Engagement Solutions and Cyber Intelligence Solutions. For the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , our Customer Engagement segment represented approximately 65% , 65% , and 66% of our total revenue, respectively, while for those same years, our Cyber Intelligence segment represented approximately 35% , 35% , and 34% of our total revenue, respectively. Key Trends and Factors That May Impact our Performance We see the following trends and factors which may impact our performance: Customer Engagement Reducing Complexity and Enhancing Agility. Many organizations have complex environments that were assembled over many years, with multiple legacy systems from many different vendors deployed in silos across the enterprise. To reduce complexity and simplify operations, these organizations are looking for new solutions that are open and flexible and make it easier to address evolving requirements, while protecting their legacy investments. Organizations are also seeking open platforms that address their customer engagement needs across many enterprise functions, 33 Table of Contents including the contact center, back-office and branch operations, self-service, e-commerce, customer experience, marketing, IT, and compliance. Modernizing Customer Engagement IT Architectures. Many organizations are looking to modernize their legacy customer engagement operations by transitioning to the cloud, adopting modern architectures that facilitate the orchestration of disparate systems and the sharing of data across enterprise functions. Organizations which are at different stages of migrating to the cloud and other modernization initiatives are also looking for vendors that can help them evolve customer engagement at their own pace with minimal disruption to their operations. Automating Customer Engagement Operations . Many organizations are seeking solutions that incorporate machine learning and analytics to reduce manual work and increase workforce efficiency through automation. They also seek to empower their customers with self-service backed by AI-powered bots and human/bot collaboration, to elevate the customer experience in a fast, personalized way. Cyber Intelligence Security Threats Becoming Increasingly Pervasive and Complex . Governments, critical infrastructure providers, and enterprises face many types of security threats from criminal and terrorist organizations and foreign governments. Some of these security threats come from well-organized and well-funded organizations that utilize new and increasingly sophisticated methods. As a result, security and intelligence organizations find it more difficult and complicated to detect, investigate and neutralize threats. Many of these organizations are seeking to deploy more advanced data mining solutions that can help them capture and analyze data from multiple sources to effectively and efficiently address the challenge of increased sophistication and complexity. Shortage of Security Analysts Increasing the Need for Automation . Security organizations are using data mining solutions to help conduct investigations and generate actionable insights. Typically, data mining solutions require security organizations to employ intelligence analysts and data scientists to operate them. However, there is a shortage of such qualified personnel globally leading to elongated investigations and increased risk that security threats go undetected or are not addressed. To overcome this challenge, many security organizations are seeking advanced data mining solutions that automate functions historically performed manually to improve the quality and speed of investigations and intelligence production. These organizations are also increasingly seeking artificial intelligence and other advanced data analysis tools to gain intelligence faster with fewer analysts and data scientists. Need for Predictive Intelligence as a Force Multiplier. Predictive intelligence is generated by correlating massive amounts of data from a wide range of disparate sources to uncover previously unknown connections, identify suspicious behaviors using advanced analytics, and predict future events. Predictive intelligence is a force multiplier, enabling security organizations to allocate resources more effectively to prioritize various operational tasks based on actionable intelligence. Security organizations are seeking advanced data mining solutions that can generate accurate and actionable predictive intelligence to shorten investigation times and empower their teams with greater insights. See Item 1, Business , of this report for more information on key trends that we believe are driving demand for our solutions and Risk Factors under Item 1A of this report for a more complete description of risks that may impact future revenue and profitability. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates An appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. The accounting policies outlined below are considered to be critical because they can materially affect our operating results and financial condition, as these policies may require us to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties. The accuracy of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a range of possible outcomes and a number of underlying variables, many of which are beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that our estimates are accurate. Revenue Recognition We derive and report our revenue in two categories: (a) product revenue, including licensing of software products and sale of hardware products (which include software that works together with the hardware to deliver the product essential functionality), and (b) service and support revenue, including revenue from installation services, post-contract customer support ( PCS ), project management, hosting services, SaaS, managed services, product warranties, business advisory consulting and 34 Table of Contents training services. We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We generate all of our revenue from contracts with customers. We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . Our revenue recognition policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates. In applying our revenue recognition policy, we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized at a point in time (generally product revenue) and which portions must be deferred and recognized over time (generally services and support revenue). We analyze various factors including, but not limited to, the selling price of undelivered services when sold on a stand-alone basis, our pricing policies, the creditworthiness of our customers, and contractual terms and conditions in helping us to make such judgments about revenue recognition. Changes in judgment on any of these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a given period. Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Typically, our customer contracts include perpetual or term-based licenses, professional services, and PCS. In contracts with multiple performance obligations, we identify each performance obligation and evaluate whether the performance obligations are distinct within the context of the contract at contract inception. Performance obligations that are not distinct at contract inception are combined. Contracts that include software customization may result in the combination of the customization services with the software license as one distinct performance obligation. The transaction price is generally in the form of a fixed fee at contract inception, and excludes taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by us from a customer. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price ( SSP ) for each performance obligation. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we estimate the SSP of each performance obligation based on either a cost-plus-margin approach or an adjusted market assessment approach. We may have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. We then look to how control transfers to the customer in order to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Software and product revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered and/or made available for download as this is the point the user of the software can direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the functional intellectual property. We do not recognize software revenue related to the renewal of software licenses earlier than the beginning of the renewal period. In contracts that include customer acceptance, we recognize revenue when we have delivered the software and received customer acceptance. We recognize revenue from PCS performance obligations, which includes software updates on a when-and-if-available basis, telephone support, and bug fixes or patches, over the term of the customer support agreement, which is typically one year. Revenue related to professional services and customer education services is typically recognized as the services are performed. Some of our customer contracts require significant customization of the product to meet the particular requirements specified by each customer. The contract pricing is stated as a fixed amount and generally results in the transfer of control of the applicable performance obligation over time. We recognize revenue based on the proportion of labor hours expended to the total hours expected to complete the performance obligation. The determination of the total labor hours expected to complete the performance obligation on fixed fee contracts involves significant judgment. We incorporate revisions to hour and cost estimates when the causal facts become known. We measure our estimate of completion on fixed-price contracts, which in turn determines the amount of revenue we recognize, based primarily on actual hours incurred to date and our estimate of remaining hours necessary to complete the contract. Our products are generally not sold with a right of return and credits and incentives granted have been minimal in both amount and frequency. Shipping and handling activities that are billed to customers and occur after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of revenue. Historically, these expenses have not been material. Accounting for Business Combinations We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development assets, and liabilities assumed, based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. These fair values are typically estimated with assistance from independent valuation specialists. The purchase price allocation process 35 Table of Contents requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, contractual support obligations assumed, contingent consideration arrangements, and pre-acquisition contingencies. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from software license sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts, and acquired developed technologies; expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; the acquired company brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company product portfolio; cost of capital and discount rates; and estimating the useful lives of acquired assets as well as the pattern or manner in which the assets will amortize. In connection with the purchase price allocations for applicable acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the contractual support obligations we are assuming from the acquired business. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach, which determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a reasonable profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services. The sum of these costs and operating profit represents an approximation of the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligations. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which can be an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, on an annual basis as of November 1, or more frequently if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of goodwill may exist. As of January 31, 2019 , our reporting units are Customer Engagement, Cyber Intelligence (excluding situational intelligence solutions), and Situational Intelligence, which is a component of our Cyber Intelligence operating segment. In testing for goodwill impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to bypass a qualitative assessment, or if our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform quantitative impairment testing. For quantitative impairment testing performed prior to February 1, 2018, we performed a two-step test by first comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. If the carrying value exceeded the fair value, a second step was performed to compute the goodwill impairment. Effective with our February 1, 2018 adoption of ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment , if our quantitative testing determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total goodwill allocated to that reporting unit, eliminating the need for the second step. For reporting units where we decide to perform a qualitative assessment, we assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which potentially impact the fair value of a reporting unit, including general economic conditions, industry and market-specific conditions, customer behavior, cost factors, our financial performance and trends, our strategies and business plans, capital requirements, management and personnel issues, and our stock price, among others. We then consider the totality of these and other factors, placing more weight on the events and circumstances that are judged to most affect a reporting unit fair value or the carrying amount of its net assets, to reach a qualitative conclusion regarding whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. For reporting units where we perform quantitative impairment testing, we utilize one or more of three primary approaches to assess fair value: (a) an income-based approach, using projected discounted cash flows, (b) a market-based approach, using 36 Table of Contents valuation multiples of comparable companies, and (c) a transaction-based approach, using valuation multiples for recent acquisitions of similar businesses made in the marketplace. Our estimate of fair value of each reporting unit is based on a number of subjective factors, including: (a) appropriate consideration of valuation approaches (income approach, comparable public company approach, and comparable transaction approach), (b) estimates of future growth rates, (c) estimates of our future cost structure, (d) discount rates for our estimated cash flows, (e) selection of peer group companies for the comparable public company and the comparable transaction approaches, (f) required levels of working capital, (g) assumed terminal value, and (h) time horizon of cash flow forecasts. The determination of reporting units also requires judgment. We assess whether a reporting unit exists within a reportable segment by identifying the unit, determining whether the unit qualifies as a business under GAAP, and assessing the availability and regular review by segment management of discrete financial information for the unit. We review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. If any indicators are present, we perform a recoverability test by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets in question to their carrying amounts. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the long-lived assets carrying amount, we determine the fair value of the long-lived asset and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. For all of our goodwill and other intangible asset impairment reviews, the assumptions and estimates used in the process are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments, and estimates we have used in our assessments are reasonable and appropriate, a material change in any of our assumptions or external factors could lead to future goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges. Based upon our November 1, 2018 qualitative goodwill impairment review of each reporting unit, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeds the respective carrying amounts. Accordingly, there was no indication of impairment and a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not performed. Based on our November 1, 2017 quantitative goodwill impairment reviews, we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values. Our Customer Engagement, Cyber Intelligence, and Situational Intelligence reporting units carried goodwill of $1.3 billion , $124.9 million , and $22.3 million , respectively, at January 31, 2019 . Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which includes the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our consolidated financial statements. Under this approach, deferred taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus deferred taxes. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities, and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. The effects of future changes in income tax laws or rates are not anticipated. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The calculation of our income tax provision involves the application of complex tax laws and requires significant judgment and estimates. On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was enacted in the United States. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and it included fundamental changes to taxation of U.S. multinational corporations. Compliance with the 2017 Tax Act requires significant complex computations not previously required by U.S. tax law. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction in which we operate at each reporting date, and we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income of the same character and in the same jurisdiction. We consider all available positive and negative evidence in making this assessment, including, but not limited to, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. In circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence indicating that our deferred tax assets are not more likely than not realizable, we establish a valuation allowance. 37 Table of Contents We use a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by assessing whether they are more likely than not sustainable, based solely on their technical merits, upon examination, and including resolution of any related appeals or litigation process. The second step is to measure the associated tax benefit of each position as the largest amount that we believe is more likely than not realizable. Differences between the amount of tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns and the amount of tax benefits recognized in our financial statements represent our unrecognized income tax benefits, which we either record as a liability or as a reduction of deferred tax assets. Our policy is to include interest (expense and/or income) and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. Contingencies We recognize an estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when and if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for claims and contingencies requires the use of significant judgment and estimates. One notable potential source of loss contingencies is pending or threatened litigation. Legal counsel and other advisors and experts are consulted on issues related to litigation as well as on matters related to contingencies occurring in the ordinary course of business. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation We recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. During the three-year period ended January 31, 2019 , restricted stock units were our predominant stock-based payment award. The fair value of these awards is equivalent to the market value of our common stock on the grant date. We periodically award restricted stock units to executive officers and certain employees that vest upon the achievement of specified performance goals or market conditions. The recognition of the compensation costs of the performance-based awards with performance goals requires an assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved. At each reporting date, we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the award, if necessary. For the performance-based awards with market conditions, the condition is incorporated into the grant date fair value valuation of the award and compensation costs are recognized even if the market condition is not satisfied. Changes in assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation and, consequently, the related expense recognized. The assumptions we use in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent our best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Results of Operations Seasonality and Cyclicality As is typical for many software and technology companies, our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical factors. In most years, our revenue and operating income are typically highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the first quarter (prior to the impact of unusual or nonrecurring items). Moreover, revenue and operating income in the first quarter of a new year may be lower than in the fourth quarter of the preceding year, in some years, by a significant margin. In addition, we generally receive a higher volume of orders in the last month of a quarter, with orders concentrated in the later part of that month. We believe that these seasonal and cyclical factors primarily reflect customer spending patterns and budget cycles, as well as the impact of incentive compensation plans for our sales personnel. While seasonal and cyclical factors such as these are common in the software and technology industry, this pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or financial performance. Many other factors, including general economic conditions, may also have an impact on our business and financial results. Overview of Operating Results 38 Table of Contents The following table sets forth a summary of certain key financial information for the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 : Year Ended January 31, (in thousands, except per share data) 2019 2018 2017 Revenue $ 1,229,747 $ 1,135,229 $ 1,062,106 Operating income $ 114,235 $ 48,630 $ 17,366 Net income (loss) attributable to Verint Systems Inc. $ 65,991 $ (6,627 ) $ (29,380 ) Net income (loss) per common share attributable to Verint Systems Inc.: Basic $ 1.02 $ (0.10 ) $ (0.47 ) Diluted $ 1.00 $ (0.10 ) $ (0.47 ) Year Ended January 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2018 . Our revenue increased approximately $94.5 million , or 8% , from $1,135.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 to $1,229.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2019 . The increase consisted of a $55.0 million increase in product revenue and a $39.5 million increase in service and support revenue. In our Customer Engagement segment, revenue increased approximately $56.2 million , or 8% , from $740.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 to $796.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2019 . The increase consisted of a $37.5 million increase in product revenue and an $18.7 million increase in service and support revenue. In our Cyber Intelligence segment, revenue increased approximately $38.3 million , or 10% , from $395.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 to $433.5 million in the year ended January 31, 2019 . The increase consisted of a $20.8 million increase in service and support revenue and $17.5 million increase in product revenue. For additional details on our revenue by segment, see Revenue by Operating Segment . Revenue in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC represented approximately 54% , 26% , and 20% of our total revenue, respectively, in the year ended January 31, 2019 , compared to approximately 53% , 31% , and 16% , respectively, in the year ended January 31, 2018 . Further details of changes in revenue are provided below. Operating income was $114.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2019 compared to $48.6 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 . This increase in operating income was primarily due to a $92.1 million increase in gross profit, reflecting increased gross profit in both of our segments and a decrease in amortization of acquired technology intangible assets, partially offset by a $26.5 million increase in operating expenses, which primarily consisted of an $18.5 million increase in net research and development expenses and an $11.2 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in amortization of other acquired intangible assets. Further details of changes in operating income are provided below. Net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc. was $66.0 million , and diluted net income per common share was $1.00 , in the year ended January 31, 2019 , compared to a net loss attributable to Verint Systems Inc. of $6.6 million , and net loss per common share of $0.10 , in the year ended January 31, 2018 . These improved operating results in the year ended January 31, 2019 were primarily due to a $65.6 million increase in operating income, as described above, and a $14.9 million decrease in our provision for income taxes primarily resulting from a decrease in accrued withholding taxes and the release of certain valuation allowances, partially offset by a $6.8 million increase in total other expense, net, and a $1.1 million increase in net income attributable to our noncontrolling interests. Further details of these changes are provided below. A portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and therefore our revenue and operating expenses are affected by fluctuations in applicable foreign currency exchange rates. When comparing average exchange rates for the year ended January 31, 2019 to average exchange rates for the year ended January 31, 2018 , the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to the Brazilian real and Australian dollar resulting in an overall decrease in our revenue on a U.S. dollar-denominated basis. Furthermore, the U.S. dollar weakened relative to our hedged Israeli shekel rate, euro, and British pound sterling, resulting in an overall increase in operating expenses on a U.S. dollar-denominated basis. For the year ended January 31, 2019 , had foreign exchange rates remained unchanged from rates in effect for the year ended January 31, 2018 , our revenue would have been approximately $0.7 million higher and our cost of revenue and operating expenses on a combined basis would have been approximately $7.8 million lower, which would have resulted in a $8.5 million increase in operating income. As of January 31, 2019 , we employed approximately 6,100 professionals, including part-time employees and certain contractors, compared to approximately 5,200 at January 31, 2018 . Year Ended January 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2017. Our revenue increased approximately $73.1 million, or 7%, from $1,062.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2017 to $1,135.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2018. The increase consisted of a $52.0 million increase in service and support revenue and a $21.1 million increase in product revenue. 39 Table of Contents In our Cyber Intelligence segment, revenue increased approximately $39.0 million, or 11%, from $356.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2017 to $395.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2018. The increase consisted of a $20.9 million increase in service and support revenue and $18.1 million increase in product revenue. In our Customer Engagement segment, revenue increased approximately $34.2 million, or 5%, from $705.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2017 to $740.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2018. The increase consisted of a $31.1 million increase in service and support revenue and a $3.1 million increase in product revenue. For additional details on our revenue by segment, see Revenue by Operating Segment . Revenue in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC represented approximately 53%, 31%, and 16% of our total revenue, respectively, in the year ended January 31, 2018, compared to approximately 54%, 30%, and 16%, respectively, in the year ended January 31, 2017. Further details of changes in revenue are provided below. Operating income was $48.6 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 compared to $17.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2017. This increase in operating income was primarily due to a $48.9 million increase in gross profit, reflecting increased gross profit in both of our segments, partially offset by an $17.7 million increase in operating expenses, which primarily consisted of a $19.6 million increase in net research and development expenses and an $8.0 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $9.9 million decrease in amortization of other acquired intangible assets. Further details of changes in operating income are provided below. Net loss attributable to Verint Systems Inc. was $6.6 million, and net loss per common share was $0.10, in the year ended January 31, 2018, compared to a net loss attributable to Verint Systems Inc. of $29.4 million, and net loss per common share of $0.47, in the year ended January 31, 2017. The decrease in net loss attributable to Verint Systems Inc. and net loss per common share in the year ended January 31, 2018 was primarily due to a $31.2 million increase in operating income, as described above, a $1.5 million increase in interest income, and a $12.8 million increase in other income. These were partially offset by a $1.0 million increase in interest expense, a $2.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt, and a $19.6 million increase in our provision for income taxes primarily resulting from a $15.0 million accrual for withholding taxes on foreign cash we may repatriate in the future. A portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and therefore our revenue and operating expenses are affected by fluctuations in applicable foreign currency exchange rates. When comparing average exchange rates for the year ended January 31, 2018 to average exchange rates for the year ended January 31, 2017, the U.S. dollar weakened relative to the euro, Australian dollar and the Singapore dollar, resulting in an overall increase in our revenue on a U.S. dollar-denominated basis. Furthermore, the U.S. dollar weakened relative to our Israeli shekel rate (hedged and unhedged), resulting in an overall increase in operating expenses on a U.S. dollar-denominated basis. For the year ended January 31, 2018, had foreign exchange rates remained unchanged from rates in effect for the year ended January 31, 2017, our revenue would have been approximately $4.8 million lower and our cost of revenue and operating expenses on a combined basis would have been approximately $10.7 million lower, which would have resulted in a $5.9 million increase in operating income. As of January 31, 2018, we employed approximately 5,200 professionals, including part-time employees and certain contractors, compared to approximately 5,100 at January 31, 2017. Revenue by Operating Segment As described in Note 2, Revenue Recognition to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this report, calculated revenue for the year ended January 31, 2019 without the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 would have been lower than the revenue we are reporting under the new accounting guidance. However, the lower calculated revenue results not only from the impact of the new accounting guidance, but also from changes we made to our business practices in anticipation, and as a result, of the new accounting guidance. These business practice changes adversely impact the calculation of revenue under the prior accounting guidance and include, among other things, the way we manage our professional services projects, offer and deploy our solutions, structure certain customer contracts, and make pricing decisions. While the many variables, required assumptions, and other complexities associated with these business practice changes make it impractical to precisely quantify the impact of these changes, we believe that calculated revenue under the prior accounting guidance, but absent these business practice changes, would have been closer to the revenue we are reporting under the new accounting guidance. 40 Table of Contents The following table sets forth revenue for each of our operating segments for the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 : Year Ended January 31, % Change (in thousands) 2019 2018 2017 2019 - 2018 2018 - 2017 Customer Engagement $ 796,287 $ 740,067 $ 705,897 8% 5% Cyber Intelligence 433,460 395,162 356,209 10% 11% Total revenue $ 1,229,747 $ 1,135,229 $ 1,062,106 8% 7% Customer Engagement Segment Year Ended January 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2018 . Customer Engagement revenue increased approximately $56.2 million , or 8% , from $740.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 to $796.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2019 . The increase consisted of a $37.5 million increase in product revenue and an $18.7 million increase in service and support revenue. The application of ASU No. 2014-09 primarily resulted in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognition for term-based licenses, which under the new accounting standard are recognized at a point in time similar to perpetual licenses rather than over time, minimum guaranteed amounts related to usage-based licenses, and professional services for which payment is contingent upon the achievement of milestones. Excluding the impact of ASU No. 2014-09, Customer Engagement revenue increased approximately $26.2 million, or 4%, from $740.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 to $766.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2019, consisting of a $19.2 million increase in product revenue and a $7.0 million increase in service and support revenue. As noted at the top of this section, as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, we made certain changes to our Customer Engagement contracting and business processes that would have otherwise not occurred under the prior revenue recognition guidance and we believe that absent these changes, revenue under the prior accounting guidance would have been closer to the revenue we are reporting under the new accounting guidance. Under either accounting standard, the increase in product revenue primarily reflects a higher aggregate value of executed perpetual and term-based license arrangements, which comprises the majority of our product revenue and which can fluctuate from period to period. The increase in service and support revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in our customer installed base, and the related support and SaaS revenue generated from this customer base. We continue to experience steady growth in services and support revenue, while product revenue growth is less predictable as the timing of our software license revenue can create significant fluctuations in our results as some large contracts can represent a significant share of our product revenue for a given period. Our business combinations can also affect our revenue mix depending on the nature of the underlying business acquired. Year Ended January 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2017. Customer Engagement revenue increased approximately $34.2 million, or 5%, from $705.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2017 to $740.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2018. The increase consisted of a $31.1 million increase in service and support revenue and a $3.1 million increase in product revenue. The increase in service and support revenue was primarily attributable to growth in sales of our cloud-based solutions during the year ended January 31, 2018. The increase in product revenue primarily reflects a modest increase in product deliveries during the year ended January 31, 2018. During the year ended January 31, 2018, we continued to experience a shift in our revenue mix from product revenue to service and support revenue as a result of several factors, including a higher component of service offerings in our standard arrangements (including licenses sold through cloud deployment), an increase in services associated with customer product upgrades, and growth in our customer installed base, both organically and as a result of business combinations. Cyber Intelligence Segment Year Ended January 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2018 . Cyber Intelligence revenue increased approximately $38.3 million , or 10% , from $395.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 to $433.5 million in the year ended January 31, 2019 . The increase consisted of a $20.8 million increase in service and support revenue and an $17.5 million increase in product revenue. The increase in service and support revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in support revenue from existing customers and an increase in revenue from our SaaS offerings, partially offset by a decrease in progress realized during the current year on long-term projects for which revenue is recognized over time using the percentage of completion ( POC ) method. The increase in product revenue was primarily due to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 which resulted in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognition for software licenses and a long-term customization project that was accepted by the customer during the year ended January 31, 2019, which had been previously recognized under prior revenue recognition accounting standards and an increase in product deliveries, including software licenses recognized over time, partially offset by a decrease in progress realized during the current period on long-term projects with revenue recognized over time using the POC method. Excluding the impact of ASU No. 2014-09, Cyber Intelligence revenue increased approximately 41 Table of Contents $20.5 million, or 5%, from $395.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 to $415.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2019. The increase consisted of a $20.8 million increase in service and support revenue, partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in product revenue. As noted at the top of this section, as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, we made certain changes to our Cyber Intelligence software licensing offerings that would have otherwise not occurred under the prior revenue recognition guidance and we believe that absent these changes, revenue under the prior accounting guidance would have been closer to the revenue we are reporting under the new accounting guidance. Year Ended January 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2017. Cyber Intelligence revenue increased approximately $39.0 million, or 11%, from $356.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2017 to $395.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2018. The increase consisted of a $20.9 million increase in service and support revenue and an $18.1 million increase in product revenue. The increase in service and support revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in progress realized during the year on projects with revenue recognized using the POC method, some of which commenced in previous years, an increase in support services revenue from new and existing customers, and an increase in revenue from our SaaS offerings. The increase in product revenue was primarily due to an increase in product deliveries and, to a lesser extent, an increase in progress realized during the year on projects with revenue recognized using the POC method, some of which commenced in previous years. Volume and Price We sell products in multiple configurations, and the price of any particular product varies depending on the configuration of the product sold. Due to the variety of customized configurations for each product we sell, we are unable to quantify the amount of any revenue increase attributable to a change in the price of any particular product and/or a change in the number of products sold. Product Revenue and Service and Support Revenue We derive and report our revenue in two categories: (a) product revenue, including licensing of software products and sale of hardware products (which include software that works together with the hardware to deliver the product essential functionality), and (b) service and support revenue, including revenue from installation services, post-contract customer support, project management, hosting services, cloud deployments, SaaS, managed services, product warranties, and business advisory consulting and training services. The following table sets forth product revenue and service and support revenue for the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 : Year Ended January 31, % Change (in thousands) 2019 2018 2017 2019 - 2018 2018 - 2017 Product revenue $ 454,650 $ 399,662 $ 378,504 14% 6% Service and support revenue 775,097 735,567 683,602 5% 8% Total revenue $ 1,229,747 $ 1,135,229 $ 1,062,106 8% 7% Product Revenue Year Ended January 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2018 . Product revenue increased approximately $55.0 million , or 14% , from $399.7 million for the year ended January 31, 2018 to $454.7 million for the year ended January 31, 2019 , resulting from a $37.5 million increase in our Customer Engagement segment and a $17.5 million increase in our Cyber Intelligence segment. Year Ended January 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2017. Product revenue increased approximately $21.2 million, or 6%, from $378.5 million for the year ended January 31, 2017 to $399.7 million for the year ended January 31, 2018, resulting from an $18.1 million increase in our Cyber Intelligence segment and a $3.1 million increase in our Customer Engagement segment. For additional information see Revenue by Operating Segment . Service and Support Revenue 42 Table of Contents Year Ended January 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2018 . Service and support revenue increased approximately $39.5 million , or 5% , from $735.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2018 to $775.1 million for the year ended January 31, 2019 , resulting from a $20.8 million increase in our Cyber Intelligence segment and an $18.7 million increase in our Customer Engagement segment. Year Ended January 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2017. Service and support revenue increased approximately $52.0 million, or 8%, from $683.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2017 to $735.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2018, resulting from a $31.1 million increase in our Customer Engagement segment and a $20.9 million increase in our Cyber Intelligence segment. For additional information see Revenue by Operating Segment . Cost of Revenue The following table sets forth cost of revenue by product and service and support, as well as amortization of acquired technology for the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 : Year Ended January 31, % Change (in thousands) 2019 2018 2017 2019 - 2018 2018 - 2017 Cost of product revenue $ 129,922 $ 131,989 $ 123,279 (2)% 7% Cost of service and support revenue 293,888 276,582 261,978 6% 6% Amortization of acquired technology 25,403 38,216 37,372 (34)% 2% Total cost of revenue $ 449,213 $ 446,787 $ 422,629 1% 6% We exclude certain costs of both product revenue and service and support revenue, including shared support costs, stock-based compensation, and asset impairment charges, among others, when calculating our operating segment gross margins. Cost of Product Revenue Cost of product revenue primarily consists of hardware material costs and royalties due to third parties for software components that are embedded in our software solutions. Cost of product revenue also includes amortization of capitalized software development costs, employee compensation and related expenses associated with our global operations, facility costs, and other allocated overhead expenses. In our Cyber Intelligence segment, cost of product revenue also includes employee compensation and related expenses, contractor and consulting expenses, and travel expenses, in each case for resources dedicated to project management and associated product delivery. As with many other technology companies, our software products tend to have higher gross margins than our hardware products, so the mix of products we sell in a particular period can have a significant impact on our gross margins in that period. Year Ended January 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2018 . Cost of product revenue decreased approximately $2.1 million , or 2% , from $132.0 million for the year ended January 31, 2018 to $129.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2019 , primarily due to a decrease in third-party hardware costs and travel expenses related to on-site deliveries in our Cyber Intelligence segment. Our overall product gross margins increased from 67% in the year ended January 31, 2018 to 71% in the year ended January 31, 2019 . Product gross margins in our Customer Engagement segment increased from 81% in the year ended January 31, 2018 to 84% in the year ended January 31, 2019 primarily due to a change in product mix. Product gross margins in our Cyber Intelligence segment increased from 57% in the year ended January 31, 2018 to 61% in the year ended January 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in third-party hardware costs as a result of a change in product mix and the implementation of a hardware cost reduction initiative for certain products. This decrease in third-party hardware costs was partially offset by the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, which impacted product gross margins primarily due to a change in the timing of cost of product revenue recognition for certain customer contracts requiring significant customization, because unlike prior guidance, the new guidance precludes the deferral of costs simply to obtain an even profit margin over the contract term. Excluding the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, our overall product gross margins increased to 70% in the year ended January 31, 2019 from 67% in the year ended January 31, 2018. Year Ended January 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2017. Cost of product revenue increased approximately $8.7 million, or 7%, from $123.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2017 to $132.0 million for the year ended January 31, 2018, primarily due to increased contractor expenses and, to a lesser extent, an increase in material costs in our Cyber Intelligence segment, driven primarily by increased revenue activity as discussed above. Our overall product gross margins 43 Table of Contents were 67% in each of the years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017. Product gross margins in our Customer Engagement segment decreased slightly from 82% in the year ended January 31, 2017 to 81% in the year ended January 31, 2018 primarily due to a change in product mix. Product gross margins in our Cyber Intelligence segment were 57% in each of the years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017. Cost of Service and Support Revenue Cost of service and support revenue primarily consists of employee compensation and related expenses, contractor costs, hosting infrastructure costs, and travel expenses relating to installation, training, consulting, and maintenance services. Cost of service and support revenue also includes stock-based compensation expenses, facility costs, and other overhead expenses. In accordance with GAAP and our accounting policy, the cost of service and support revenue is generally expensed as incurred in the period in which the services are performed. Year Ended January 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2018 . Cost of service and support revenue increased approximately $17.3 million , or 6% , from $276.6 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 to $293.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation and related expenses in both our Customer Engagement and Cyber Intelligence segments as a result of additional services employee headcount to support the delivery of our services and support revenue, and an increase in costs associated with providing our cloud-based solutions, which corresponds with growth in cloud-based revenue. Our overall service and support gross margins were 62% in each of the years ended January 31, 2019 and 2018 . Cost of service and support revenue under the prior revenue recognition guidance did not differ materially from cost of service and support revenue under ASU No. 2014-09 in the year ended January 31, 2019. Year Ended January 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2017. Cost of service and support revenue increased approximately $14.6 million, or 6%, from $262.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2017 to $276.6 million in the year ended January 31, 2018. Cost of service and support revenue increased in our Customer Engagement segment primarily due to costs associated with providing our cloud-based solutions, which corresponds with growth in cloud-based revenue, and an increase in costs attributable to the use of contractors during the year ended January 31, 2018. Cost of service and support revenue increased in our Cyber Intelligence segment primarily due to costs associated with increased use of contractors as a result of increased revenue activity as discussed above. Our overall service and support gross margins were 62% in each of the years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization of acquired technology consists of amortization of technology assets acquired in connection with business combinations. Year Ended January 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2018 . Amortization of acquired technology decreased approximately $12.8 million , or 34% , from $38.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 to $25.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2019 . The decrease was attributable to acquired technology intangible assets from historical business combinations becoming fully amortized during the year ended January 31, 2019 , partially offset by amortization expense of acquired technology-based intangible assets associated with recent business combinations. Year Ended January 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2017. Amortization of acquired technology increased approximately $0.8 million, or 2%, from $37.4 million in the year ended January 31, 2017 to $38.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2018. The increase was attributable to amortization expense of acquired technology-based intangible assets associated with business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2018, as well as business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2017 for which a full year of amortization expense is reflected in the year ended January 31, 2018. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense as a result of acquired technology intangible assets from historical business combinations becoming fully amortized during the year ended January 31, 2018. Further discussion regarding our business combinations appears in Note 5, Business Combinations to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report. Research and Development, Net Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and subcontracting expenses, facility costs, and other allocated overhead, net of certain software development costs that are capitalized, as well as reimbursements under government programs. Software development costs are capitalized upon the establishment of technological feasibility and continue to be capitalized through the general release of the related software product. 44 Table of Contents The following table sets forth research and development, net for the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 : Year Ended January 31, % Change (in thousands) 2019 2018 2017 2019 - 2018 2018 - 2017 Research and development, net $ 209,106 $ 190,643 $ 171,070 10% 11% Year Ended January 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2018 . Research and development, net increased approximately $18.5 million , or 10% , from $190.6 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 to $209.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily due to a $14.0 million increase in employee compensation and related expenses and a $4.1 million increase in allocated overhead costs as a result of increased R&D headcount, and a $5.7 million increase in contractor expenses primarily in our Cyber Intelligence segment, partially offset by a $3.3 million decrease in stock-based compensation expenses as a result of a change in bonus payment structure, a $1.7 million decrease in capitalized software development costs, and a $0.5 million decrease in R&D reimbursements received from government programs in the year ended January 31, 2019 compared to the year ended January 31, 2018. Year Ended January 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2017. Research and development, net increased approximately $19.5 million, or 11%, from $171.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2017 to $190.6 million in the year ended January 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $12.7 million increase in employee compensation and related expenses as a result of increased R&D headcount, a $3.6 million increase in contractor expenses primarily in our Cyber Intelligence segment, and a $1.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses for R&D employees. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and related expenses, professional fees, sales and marketing expenses, including travel costs, sales commissions and sales referral fees, facility costs, communication expenses, and other administrative expenses. The following table sets forth selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 : Year Ended January 31, % Change (in thousands) 2019 2018 2017 2019 - 2018 2018 - 2017 Selling, general and administrative $ 426,183 $ 414,960 $ 406,952 3% 2% Year Ended January 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2018 . Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $11.2 million , or 3% , from $415.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 to $426.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2019 . This increase was primarily attributable to a $10.6 million increase in employee compensation expenses due to increased headcount as a result of recent business combinations, a $3.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense as a result of a change in bonus payment structure, a $2.9 million increase in travel related expenses due primarily to increased travel expenses in our Customer Engagement segment, and a $1.9 million increase in depreciation expense on fixed assets used for general administration purposes. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $4.7 million due to the change in the fair value of our obligations under contingent consideration arrangements, from a net benefit of $8.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 to a net benefit of $3.6 million during the year ended January 31, 2019 , as the result of revised outlooks for several unrelated arrangements. These increases were partially offset by a $6.8 million decrease in allocated overhead costs, a $3.4 million decrease in facility expenses primarily due to the early termination of a facility lease in the EMEA region during the prior year, and a $2.7 million decrease in contractor expenses primarily due to the substantial completion of certain business agility initiatives in the prior year. Year Ended January 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $8.0 million, or 2%, from $407.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2017 to $415.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to the following: $8.5 million increase in employee compensation and related expenses attributed primarily to additional personnel driven by business combinations; $5.0 million increase in professional fees resulting primarily from legal services provided in connection with business combinations; 45 Table of Contents $4.7 million increase in contractor expenses due primarily to business agility initiatives, including upgrading our business information systems; $3.3 million charge for impairments of certain acquired customer-related intangible assets in our Customer Engagement segment; $2.4 increase in stock-based compensation expense due primarily to business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2018, as well as business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2017 for which a full year of stock-based compensation expense is reflected in the year ended January 31, 2018; $2.0 million increase in software subscription expenses related to internal-use software; and $1.8 million increase in rent expense associated with business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2018, as well as business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2017 for which a full year of rent expense is reflected in the year ended January 31, 2018. These increases were partially offset by a $15.6 million decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses resulting from changes in fair value of our obligations under contingent consideration arrangements from a net expense of $7.3 million during the year ended January 31, 2017 to net benefit of $8.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2018. The impact of contingent consideration arrangements on our operating results can vary over time as we revise our outlook for achieving the performance targets underlying the arrangements. This impact on our operating results may be more significant in some periods than in others, depending on a number of factors, including the magnitude of the change in the outlook for each arrangement separately as well as the number of contingent consideration arrangements in place, the liabilities requiring adjustment in that period, and the net effect of those adjustments. Additionally, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by $4.6 million as a result of increased capitalization of costs associated with development of internal-use software during the year ended January 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. Amortization of Other Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization of other acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations, including customer relationships, distribution networks, trade names and non-compete agreements. The following table sets forth amortization of other acquired intangible assets for the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 : Year Ended January 31, % Change (in thousands) 2019 2018 2017 2019 - 2018 2018 - 2017 Amortization of other acquired intangible assets $ 31,010 $ 34,209 $ 44,089 (9)% (22)% Year Ended January 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2018 . Amortization of other acquired intangible assets decreased approximately $3.2 million , or 9% , from $34.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 to $31.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2019 as a result of acquired customer-related intangible assets from historical business combinations becoming fully amortized, partially offset by an increase in amortization expense from acquired intangible assets from business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2019 , as well as business combinations that closed during the prior year, for which a full year of amortization expense is reflected in the current year. Year Ended January 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2017. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets decreased approximately $9.9 million, or 22%, from $44.1 million in the year ended January 31, 2017 to $34.2 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 as a result of acquired customer-related intangible assets from historical business combinations becoming fully amortized, partially offset by an increase in amortization expense from acquired intangible assets from business combinations that closed during the year ended January 31, 2018, as well as business combinations that closed during the prior year, for which a full year of amortization expense is reflected in the year ended January 31, 2018. Further discussion regarding our business combinations appears in Note 5, Business Combinations to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report. Other Expense, Net The following table sets forth total other expense, net for the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 : 46 Table of Contents Year Ended January 31, % Change (in thousands) 2019 2018 2017 2019 - 2018 2018 - 2017 Interest income $ 4,777 $ 2,477 $ 1,048 93% 136% Interest expense (37,344 ) (35,959 ) (34,962 ) 4% 3% Losses on early retirements of debt (2,150 ) % * Other (expense) income: Foreign currency (losses) gains (5,519 ) 6,760 (2,743 ) (182)% (346)% Gains (losses) on derivatives 2,511 (17 ) (322 ) * * Other, net (898 ) (841 ) (3,861 ) 7% * Total other (expense) income, net (3,906 ) 5,902 (6,926 ) (166)% (185)% Total other expense, net $ (36,473 ) $ (29,730 ) $ (40,840 ) 23% (27)% * Percentage is not meaningful. Year Ended January 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2018 . Total other expense, net, increased by $6.8 million from $29.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 to $36.5 million in the year ended January 31, 2019 . Interest expense increased to $37.3 million in the year ended January 31, 2019 from $36.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 primarily due to higher interest rates on outstanding borrowings during the year ended January 31, 2019 , partially offset by a $1.0 million reversal of accrued interest related to a legal matter which was settled in the year ended January 31, 2019. During the year ended January 31, 2018, we entered into a new credit agreement (the 2017 Credit Agreement ), which was subsequently amended, and terminated our Prior Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 7, Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report). In connection with these transactions, we recorded $2.2 million of losses on early retirements of debt. There were no comparable charges in the year ended January 31, 2019. We recorded $5.5 million of net foreign currency losses in the year ended January 31, 2019 compared to $6.8 million of net foreign currency gains in the year ended January 31, 2018 . Foreign currency losses in the year ended January 31, 2019 resulted primarily from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro from January 31, 2018 to January 31, 2019, resulting in foreign currency losses on euro denominated net assets in certain entities which use a U.S. dollar functional currency and foreign currency losses on U.S. dollar-denominated net liabilities in certain entities which use a euro functional currency, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Singapore dollar, resulting in foreign currency losses on Singapore dollar-denominated net assets in certain entities which use a U.S. dollar functional currency, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling, resulting in foreign currency losses on U.S. dollar-denominated net liabilities in certain entities which use a British pound sterling functional currency, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar, resulting in foreign currency losses on U.S. dollar-denominated net liabilities in certain entities which use an Australian dollar functional currency. In the year ended January 31, 2019 , there were net gains on derivative financial instruments (not designated as hedging instruments) of $2.5 million , compared to insignificant net losses on such instruments for the year ended January 31, 2018 . The net gains in the current period primarily reflected gains on an interest rate swap and contracts executed to hedge movements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Singapore dollar. Year Ended January 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2017. Total other expense, net, decreased by $11.1 million from $40.8 million in the year ended January 31, 2017 to $29.7 million in the year ended January 31, 2018. Interest expense increased to $36.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 from $35.0 million in the year ended January 31, 2017 primarily due to higher interest rates on outstanding borrowings during the year ended January 31, 2018. During the year ended January 31, 2018 we entered into the 2017 Credit Agreement with certain lenders and terminated our Prior Credit Agreement. In connection with these transactions, we recorded a $2.2 million loss on early retirement of debt. There were no comparable charges in the year ended January 31, 2017. We recorded $6.8 million of net foreign currency gains in the year ended January 31, 2018 compared to $2.7 million of net losses in the year ended January 31, 2017. Foreign currency gains in the year ended January 31, 2018 resulted primarily from the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, resulting in foreign currency gains on euro denominated net assets in certain entities which use a U.S. dollar functional currency, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Singapore dollar, resulting in 47 Table of Contents foreign currency gains on Singapore dollar-denominated net assets in certain entities which use a U.S. dollar functional currency, and the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling, resulting in foreign currency gains on U.S. dollar-denominated net liabilities in certain entities which use a British pound sterling functional currency. In the year ended January 31, 2018, there were insignificant net losses on derivative financial instruments (not designated as hedging instruments), compared to net losses of $0.3 million on such instruments for the year ended January 31, 2017. The net losses in the prior year reflected losses on contracts executed to hedge movements in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real. Other net expenses decreased to $0.8 million in the year ended January 31, 2018 from $3.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2017. In the year ended January 31, 2017, we recorded a write-off of a $2.4 million cost-basis investment in our Cyber Intelligence segment, with no comparable charges in the year ended January 31, 2018. Also contributing to the decrease in other net expenses was resolution of a previously accrued sales tax contingency in our APAC region during the year ended January 31, 2018. Provision for Income Taxes The following table sets forth our provision for income taxes for the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 : Year Ended January 31, (in thousands) 2019 2018 2017 Provision for income taxes $ 7,542 $ 22,354 $ 2,772 Year Ended January 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2018 . Our effective income tax rate was 9.7% for the year ended January 31, 2019 , compared to an effective income tax rate of 118.3% for the year ended January 31, 2018 . For the year ended January 31, 2019 , our effective income tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due to a net reduction in valuation allowances of $24.1 million , the mix and levels of income and losses among taxing jurisdictions, and changes in unrecognized income tax benefits. The net reduction in valuation allowance is primarily related to reductions in U.S. valuation allowances as a result of deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with business combinations, and the utilization of significant NOLs, which reduced our deferred tax assets. As a result, we ended the year in a net federal deferred tax liability position in the U.S. The deferred income tax liabilities recorded in connection with business combinations were primarily attributable to acquired intangible assets to the extent the amortization will not be deductible for income tax purposes. Under accounting guidelines, because the amortization of the intangible assets in future periods provides a source of taxable income, we expect to realize a portion of our existing deferred income tax assets. As such, we reduced the valuation allowance recorded on our deferred income tax assets to the extent of the deferred income tax liabilities recorded. Because the valuation allowance related to existing Verint deferred income tax assets, the impact of the release was reflected as a discrete income tax benefit and not as a component of the business combination accounting. In accordance with the provisions of SAB No. 118, as of January 31, 2018 we considered amounts related to the 2017 Tax Act to be reasonably estimated. During the year ended January 31, 2019, we refined and completed the accounting for the 2017 Tax Act as we obtained, prepared, and analyzed additional information and as additional legislative, regulatory, and accounting guidance and interpretations became available, resulting in no adjustment under SAB No. 118. For the year ended January 31, 2018 , our effective income tax rate was higher than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 33.8% due to withholding tax expense of $15.0 million , a benefit of $5.4 million related to the revaluation of U.S. deferred tax items resulting from the 2017 Tax Act, the mix and levels of income and losses among taxing jurisdictions, and changes in unrecognized income tax benefits. Our statutory rate for the year ended January 31, 2018 was 33.8% due to the 2017 Tax Act, which included a reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%. Section 15 of the Internal Revenue Code stipulates that our fiscal year ending January 31, 2018 had a blended corporate tax rate of 33.8% which is based on the applicable tax rates before and after the 2017 Tax Act and the number of days in the period. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we recorded a Transition Tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings. The Transition tax resulted in no impact to the tax provision as we used a portion of the NOL carryforward and released valuation allowances on the associated deferred tax assets resulting in a net impact of $0 to the tax provision. Foreign earnings subject to the Transition Tax will not be subject to further U.S. taxation upon repatriation. Therefore, we may repatriate certain foreign cash, a portion of which will be subject to a withholding tax. As such, withholding tax of $15 million was recorded. Also, we remeasured U.S. deferred tax items to reflect the reduced rate under the 2017 Tax Act resulting in the $5.4 million benefit. In addition, pre-tax income in our profitable jurisdictions, where we recorded income tax provisions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate, was greater than the pre-tax losses in our domestic and foreign jurisdictions where we maintained valuation allowances and did not record the related income tax benefits. The result was an income tax provision of $22.4 million on a pre-tax income of 48 Table of Contents $18.9 million, which represented an effective income tax rate of 118.3%. Excluding the net impact of the 2017 Tax Act, the result was an income tax provision of $12.7 million on pre-tax income of $18.9 million, resulting in an effective income tax rate of 67.3% Year Ended January 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended January 31, 2017. Our effective income tax rate was 118.3% for the year ended January 31, 2018, compared to a negative effective income tax rate of 11.8% for the year ended January 31, 2017. For the year ended January 31, 2018, our effective income tax rate was higher than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 33.8% due to withholding tax expenses of $15 million, a benefit of $5.4 million related to the revaluation of U.S. deferred tax items, the mix and levels of income and losses among taxing jurisdictions, and changes in unrecognized income tax benefits. Our statutory rate for the year ended January 31, 2018 is 33.8% due to the 2017 Tax Act as discussed above. For the year ended January 31, 2017, our effective income tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% due to the release of $10.4 million of valuation allowances, and the mix and levels of income and losses among taxing jurisdictions, offset by changes in unrecognized income tax benefits. We maintain valuation allowances on our net U.S. deferred income tax assets related to federal and certain state jurisdictions. In connection with business combinations during the year ended January 31, 2017, we recorded deferred income tax liabilities primarily attributable to acquired intangible assets to the extent the amortization will not be deductible for income tax purposes. Pre-tax income in our profitable jurisdictions, where we recorded income tax provisions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate, was lower than the pre-tax losses in our domestic and foreign jurisdictions where we maintain valuation allowances and did not record the related income tax benefits. The result was an income tax provision of $2.8 million on a pre-tax loss of $23.5 million, which represented a negative effective income tax rate of 11.8%. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our primary recurring source of cash is the collection of proceeds from the sale of products and services to our customers, including cash periodically collected in advance of delivery or performance. Our primary recurring use of cash is payment of our operating costs, which consist primarily of employee-related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for marketing, facilities and overhead costs, and capital expenditures. We also utilize cash for debt service and periodically for business acquisitions. Cash generated from operations, along with our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, are our primary sources of operating liquidity, and we believe that our operating liquidity is sufficient to support our current business operations, including debt service and capital expenditure requirements. On June 29, 2017, we entered into the 2017 Credit Agreement with certain lenders, and terminated our Prior Credit Agreement. The 2017 Credit Agreement was amended on January 31, 2018 (the 2018 Amendment ). Further discussion of our 2017 Credit Agreement and 2018 Amendment appears below, under Financing Arrangements . We have historically expanded our business in part by investing in strategic growth initiatives, including acquisitions of products, technologies, and businesses. We may finance such acquisitions using cash, debt, stock, or a combination of the foregoing, however, we have used cash as consideration for substantially all of our historical business acquisitions, including approximately $90 million and $103 million of net cash expended for business acquisitions during the years ended January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We continually examine our options with respect to terms and sources of existing and future short-term and long-term capital resources to enhance our operating results and to ensure that we retain financial flexibility, and may from time to time elect to raise capital through the issuance of additional equity or the incurrence of additional debt. A considerable portion of our operating income is earned outside the United States. Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash, cash equivalents, and bank time deposits (excluding any long-term portions) held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States were $399.4 million and $346.2 million as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and are generally used to fund the subsidiaries operating requirements and to invest in growth initiatives, including business acquisitions. These subsidiaries also held long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, and restricted bank time deposits of $23.1 million and $28.4 million at January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 49 Table of Contents We currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest a portion of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, which, as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, may now be repatriated without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. Should other circumstances arise whereby we require more capital in the United States than is generated by our domestic operations, or should we otherwise consider it in our best interests, we could repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions, which could result in higher effective tax rates. As noted above, we currently intend to indefinitely reinvest a portion of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to finance foreign activities. Except to the extent of the U.S. tax provided on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of January 31, 2019, and withholding taxes of $15.0 million accrued as of January 31, 2019, with respect to certain identified cash that may be repatriated to the U.S., we have not provided tax on the outside basis difference of foreign subsidiaries nor have we provided for any additional withholding or other tax that may be applicable should a future distribution be made from any unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Due to complexities in the laws of the foreign jurisdictions and the assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to estimate the total amount of income and withholding taxes that would have to be provided on such earnings. The following table summarizes our total cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, restricted bank time deposits, and short-term investments, as well as our total debt, as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 : January 31, (in thousands) 2019 2018 Cash and cash equivalents $ 369,975 $ 337,942 Restricted cash and cash equivalents, and restricted bank time deposits (excluding long term portions) 42,262 33,303 Short-term investments 32,329 6,566 Total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, restricted bank time deposits, and short-term investments $ 444,566 $ 377,811 Total debt, including current portions $ 782,128 $ 772,984 Consolidated Cash Flow Activity The following table summarizes selected items from our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 : Year Ended January 31, (in thousands) 2019 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 215,251 $ 176,327 $ 172,415 Net cash used in investing activities (175,723 ) (146,194 ) (116,442 ) Net cash used in financing activities (21,881 ) (5,503 ) (56,919 ) Effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (3,158 ) 4,251 (4,167 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents $ 14,489 $ 28,881 $ (5,113 ) Our operating activities generated $215.3 million of cash during the year ended January 31, 2019 , which was partially offset by $197.6 million of net cash used in combined investing and financing activities during this period. Further discussion of these items appears below. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities is driven primarily by our net income or loss, as adjusted for non-cash items, and working capital changes. Operating activities generated $215.3 million of net cash during the year ended January 31, 2019 , compared to $176.3 million generated during the year ended January 31, 2018 . Our improved operating cash flow in the current year was primarily due to higher operating income, partially offset by the net effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities and the net effect of non-cash items, as compared to the prior year. Operating activities generated $176.3 million of net cash during the year ended January 31, 2018, compared to $172.4 million generated during the year ended January 31, 2017. Our improved operating cash flow in the year ended January 31, 2018 reflected, in part, $3.6 million of lower combined interest and net income tax payments, compared to the prior year. 50 Table of Contents Our cash flow from operating activities can fluctuate from period to period due to several factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, the timing and amounts of interest, income tax and other payments, and our operating results. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities During the year ended January 31, 2019 , our investing activities used $175.7 million of net cash, including $90.0 million of net cash utilized for business acquisitions, $39.0 million of payments for property, equipment, and capitalized software development costs, $25.9 million of net purchases of short-term investments, and a $21.3 million increase in restricted bank time deposits during the period. Restricted bank time deposits are typically short-term deposits used to secure bank guarantees in connection with sales contracts, the amounts of which will fluctuate from period to period. The cash used by these investing activities was partially offset by proceeds from settlements of our derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges. During the year ended January 31, 2018, our investing activities used $146.2 million of net cash, including $103.0 million of net cash utilized for business acquisitions, $38.7 million of payments for property, equipment, and capitalized software development costs, $3.2 million of net purchases of short-term investments, and $1.7 million of net cash used by other investing activities. During the year ended January 31, 2017, our investing activities used $116.4 million of net cash, including $141.8 million of net cash utilized for business acquisitions, and $29.9 million of payments for property, equipment, and capitalized software development costs. Partially offsetting those uses were $52.6 million of net proceeds from sales, maturities, and purchases of short-term investments and a $3.0 million decrease in restricted bank time deposits during the period associated with several large sales contracts. We had no significant commitments for capital expenditures at January 31, 2019 . Net Cash Used in Financing Activities For the year ended January 31, 2019 , our financing activities used $21.9 million of net cash, the most significant portions of which were $10.7 million for the financing portion of payments under contingent consideration arrangements related to prior business combinations, $6.0 million for repayments of borrowings and other financing obligations, dividend payments of $4.4 million to the noncontrolling interest holders in our joint venture, which serves as a systems integrator for certain Asian markets, and $0.2 million paid for costs related to the 2017 Credit Agreement. For the year ended January 31, 2018, our financing activities used $5.5 million of net cash. Under the 2017 Credit Agreement, we received net proceeds of $424.5 million from the 2017 Term Loan, the majority of which was used to repay all $406.9 million that remained outstanding under the 2014 Term Loans (both the 2017 Term Loan and the 2014 Term Loans are as defined in Note 7, Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report) at June 29, 2017 upon termination of the Prior Credit Agreement. In addition, under the 2018 Amendment, $19.9 million of the 2017 Term Loan was considered extinguished and replaced by new loans. We also used $5.1 million for repayments of borrowings and other financing obligations during the year. Other financing activities during the year included payments of $7.5 million for the financing portion of payments under contingent consideration arrangements related to prior business combinations, $7.1 million paid for debt issuance costs related to the 2017 Credit Agreement, and dividend payments of $3.3 million to the noncontrolling interest holders in our joint venture. For the year ended January 31, 2017, our financing activities used $56.9 million of net cash, the most significant portions of which were payments of $46.9 million for stock repurchases under our share repurchase program, $3.3 million for repayments of borrowings and other financing obligations, $3.2 million for the financing portion of payments under contingent consideration arrangements related to prior business combinations, and dividend payments of $2.4 million to the noncontrolling interest holders in our joint venture. Liquidity and Capital Resources Requirements Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated operating costs, required payments of principal and interest, working capital needs, ordinary course capital expenditures, research and development spending, and other commitments for at least the next 12 months. Currently, we have no plans to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, which are not permitted under our 2017 Credit Agreement. 51 Table of Contents Our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products and service and support, including the impact of changes in customer buying behavior due to circumstances over which we have no control. If we determine to make additional business acquisitions or otherwise require additional funds, we may need to raise additional capital, which could involve the issuance of additional equity or debt securities or increase our borrowings under our credit facility. On March 29, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a common stock repurchase program of up to $150 million over two years following the date of announcement. This program expired on March 29, 2018. We made a total of $46.9 million in repurchases and we did not acquire any shares of treasury stock during the year ended January 31, 2019 under the program. Financing Arrangements 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes On June 18, 2014, we issued $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2021, unless earlier converted by the holders pursuant to their terms. Net proceeds from the Notes after underwriting discounts were $391.9 million. The Notes pay interest in cash semiannually in arrears at a rate of 1.50% per annum. The Notes were issued concurrently with our public issuance of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, the majority of the combined net proceeds of which were used to partially repay certain indebtedness under the Prior Credit Agreement. The Notes are unsecured and rank senior in right of payment to our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to our indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. The Notes are convertible into, at our election, cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of both, subject to satisfaction of specified conditions and during specified periods, as described below. If converted, we currently intend to pay cash in respect of the principal amount of the Notes. The Notes have a conversion rate of 15.5129 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an effective conversion price of approximately $64.46 per share of common stock and would result in the issuance of approximately 6,205,000 shares if all of the Notes were converted. The conversion rate has not changed since issuance of the Notes, although throughout the term of the Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events. Holders may surrender their Notes for conversion at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 1, 2020, only under the following circumstances: during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter which ended on September 30, 2014, if the closing sale price of our common stock, for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is more than 130% of the conversion price of the Notes in effect on each applicable trading day; during the ten consecutive trading-day period following any five consecutive trading-day period in which the trading price for the Notes for each such trading day was less than 98% of the closing sale price of our common stock on such date multiplied by the then-current conversion rate; or upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as described in the indenture governing the Notes, such as a consolidation, merger, or binding share exchange. On or after December 1, 2020 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may surrender their Notes for conversion regardless of whether any of the foregoing conditions have been satisfied. Holders of the Notes may require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. As of January 31, 2019 , the Notes were not convertible. Note Hedges and Warrants 52 Table of Contents Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the Note Hedges ) and sold warrants (the Warrants ). The combination of the Note Hedges and the Warrants serves to increase the effective initial conversion price for the Notes to $75.00 per share. The Note Hedges and Warrants are each separate instruments from the Notes. Note Hedges Pursuant to the Note Hedges, we purchased call options on our common stock, under which we have the right to acquire from the counterparties up to approximately 6,205,000 shares of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, at a price of $64.46, which equals the initial conversion price of the Notes. Our exercise rights under the Note Hedges generally trigger upon conversion of the Notes and the Note Hedges terminate upon maturity of the Notes, or the first day the Notes are no longer outstanding. The Note Hedges may be settled in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, at our option, and are intended to reduce our exposure to potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes. We paid $60.8 million for the Note Hedges, which was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. As of January 31, 2019 , we had not purchased any shares of our common stock under the Note Hedges. Warrants We sold the Warrants to several counterparties. The Warrants provide the counterparties rights to acquire from us up to approximately 6,205,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $75.00 per share. The Warrants expire incrementally on a series of expiration dates beginning in August 2021. At expiration, if the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the Warrants, we will be obligated to issue shares of our common stock having a value equal to such excess. The Warrants could have a dilutive effect on net income per share to the extent that the market value of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the Warrants. Proceeds from the sale of the Warrants were $45.2 million and were recorded as additional paid-in capital. As of January 31, 2019 , no Warrants had been exercised and all Warrants remained outstanding. Credit Agreements On June 29, 2017, we entered into the 2017 Credit Agreement with certain lenders, and terminated the Prior Credit Agreement. The 2017 Credit Agreement provides for $725.0 million of senior secured credit facilities, comprised of a $425.0 million term loan maturing on June 29, 2024 (the 2017 Term Loan ) and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility maturing on June 29, 2022 (the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility ), subject to increase and reduction from time to time according to the terms of the 2017 Credit Agreement. The majority of the proceeds from the 2017 Term Loan were used to repay all $406.9 million that remained outstanding under the 2014 Term Loans at June 29, 2017 upon termination of the Prior Credit Agreement. There were no borrowings under our Prior Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in Note 7, Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this report) at June 29, 2017. The maturity dates of the 2017 Term Loan and 2017 Revolving Credit Facility will be accelerated to March 1, 2021, if on such date any Notes remain outstanding. The 2017 Term Loan was subject to an original issuance discount of approximately $0.5 million. This discount is being amortized as interest expense over the term of the 2017 Term Loan using the effective interest method. Interest rates on loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement are periodically reset, at our option, at either a Eurodollar Rate or an ABR rate (each as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement), plus in each case a margin. We are required to pay a commitment fee with respect to unused availability under the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility at a rate per annum determined by reference to our Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement) leverage ratio (the Leverage Ratio ). The 2017 Term Loan requires quarterly principal payments of approximately $1.1 million, which commenced on August 1, 2017, with the remaining balance due on June 29, 2024. Optional prepayments of loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement are generally permitted without premium or penalty. On January 31, 2018, we entered into the 2018 Amendment to our 2017 Credit Agreement, providing for, among other things, a reduction of the interest rate margins on the 2017 Term Loan from 2.25% to 2.00% for Eurodollar loans, and from 1.25% to 1.00% for ABR loans. The vast majority of the impact of the 2018 Amendment was accounted for as a debt modification. For 53 Table of Contents the portion of the 2017 Term Loan which was considered extinguished and replaced by new loans, we wrote off $0.2 million of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs as a loss on early retirement of debt during the three months ended January 31, 2018. The remaining unamortized deferred debt issuance costs and discount are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2017 Term Loan. For loans under the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility, the margin is determined by reference to our Leverage Ratio. As of January 31, 2019, the interest rate on the 2017 Term Loan was 4.52% . Taking into account the impact of the original issuance discount and related deferred debt issuance costs, the effective interest rate on the 2017 Term Loan was approximately 4.70% at January 31, 2019. In February 2016, we executed a pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap agreement with a multinational financial institution to partially mitigate risks associated with the variable interest rate on the term loans under our Prior Credit Agreement, under which we pay interest at a fixed rate of 4.143% and receive variable interest of three-month LIBOR (subject to a minimum of 0.75%), plus a spread of 2.75%, on a notional amount of $200.0 million (the 2016 Swap ). Although the Prior Credit Agreement was terminated on June 29, 2017, the 2016 Swap remains in effect, and serves as an economic hedge to partially mitigate the risk of higher borrowing costs under the 2017 Credit Agreement resulting from increases in market interest rates. The 2016 Swap is no longer formally designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes, and therefore settlements are reported within other (expense) income, net on the consolidated statement of operations, not within interest expense. In April 2018, we executed a pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap agreement with a multinational financial institution to partially mitigate risks associated with the variable interest rate on our 2017 Term Loan for periods following the termination of the 2016 Swap, under which we will pay interest at a fixed rate of 2.949% and receive variable interest of three-month LIBOR (subject to a minimum of 0.00%), on a notional amount of $200.0 million (the 2018 Swap ). The effective date of the 2018 Swap is September 6, 2019, and settlements with the counterparty will occur on a quarterly basis, beginning on November 1, 2019. The 2018 Swap will terminate on June 29, 2024. During the operating term of the 2018 Swap, if we elect three-month LIBOR at the periodic interest rate reset dates for at least $200.0 million of our 2017 Term Loan, the annual interest rate on that amount of the 2017 Term Loan will be fixed at 4.949% (including the impact of our current 2.00% interest rate margin on Eurodollar loans) for the applicable interest rate period. The 2018 Swap is designated as a cash flow hedge and as such, changes in its fair value are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheet and are reclassified into the statement of operations within interest expense in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Our obligations under the 2017 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by each of our direct and indirect existing and future material domestic wholly owned restricted subsidiaries, and are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets and the assets of the guarantor subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The 2017 Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type. The 2017 Credit Agreement also contains a financial covenant that, solely with respect to the 2017 Revolving Credit Facility, requires us to maintain a Leverage Ratio of no greater than 4.50 to 1. At January 31, 2019, our Leverage Ratio was approximately 2.3 to 1. The limitations imposed by the covenants are subject to certain exceptions as detailed in the 2017 Credit Agreement. The 2017 Credit Agreement provides for events of default with corresponding grace periods that we believe are customary for credit facilities of this type. Upon an event of default, all of our obligations owed under the 2017 Credit Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable, and the lenders commitments to make loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement may be terminated. Contractual Obligations At January 31, 2019 , our contractual obligations were as follows: 54 Table of Contents Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Total < 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years > 5 years Long-term debt obligations, including interest $ 938,966 $ 29,098 $ 455,189 $ 45,308 $ 409,371 Operating lease obligations 129,379 22,769 41,099 32,034 33,477 Capital lease obligations 4,597 1,343 2,382 872 Purchase obligations 158,712 120,349 22,332 16,031 Other long-term obligations 286 47 94 94 51 Total contractual obligations $ 1,231,940 $ 173,606 $ 521,096 $ 94,339 $ 442,899 The long-term debt obligations reflected above include projected interest payments over the term of our outstanding debt as of January 31, 2019 , assuming interest rates consistent with those in effect for our 2017 Term Loan as of January 31, 2019 . Operating lease obligations reflected above exclude future sublease income from certain space we have subleased to third parties. As of January 31, 2019 , total expected future sublease income was $4.5 million and will range from $0.6 million to $0.9 million on an annual basis through February 2025. We entered into leases for infrastructure equipment that qualify as capital leases during the years ended January 31, 2019 and 2018. Our purchase obligations are associated with agreements for purchases of goods or services generally including agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. Agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions with no penalties are excluded from these purchase obligations. Our consolidated balance sheet at January 31, 2019 included $33.1 million of non-current tax reserves, net of related benefits (including interest and penalties of $4.6 million ) for uncertain tax positions. However, these amounts are not included in the table above because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of payments for these obligations. We do not expect to make any significant payments for these uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months. Contingent Payments Associated with Business Combinations In connection with certain of our business combinations, we have agreed to make contingent cash payments to the former owners of the acquired companies based upon achievement of performance targets following the acquisition dates. For the year ended January 31, 2019 , we made $13.6 million of payments under contingent consideration arrangements. As of January 31, 2019 , potential future cash payments under contingent consideration arrangements, including consideration earned in completed performance periods which is still to be paid, total $150.1 million, the estimated fair value of which was $61.3 million , including $28.4 million reported in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $32.9 million reported in other liabilities. The performance periods associated with these potential payments extend through January 2022. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 31, 2019 , we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
