Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations On January 2, 2019, the Company announced the completion of the Holding Company Reorganization, which resulted in Montana-Dakota becoming a subsidiary of the Company. The merger was conducted pursuant to Section 251(g) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which provides for the formation of a holding company without a vote of the stockholders of the constituent corporation. Immediately after consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, the Company had, on a consolidated basis, the same assets, businesses and operations as Montana-Dakota had immediately prior to the consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization. As a result of the Holding Company Reorganization, the Company became the successor issuer to Montana-Dakota pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) of the Exchange Act, and as a result, the Company's common stock was deemed registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. The Company operates with a two-platform business model. Its regulated energy delivery platform and its construction materials and services platform are each comprised of different operating segments. Some of these segments experience seasonality related to the industries in which they operate. The two-platform approach helps balance this seasonality and the risk associated with each type of industry. Through its regulated energy delivery platform, the Company provides electric and natural gas services to customers, generates, transmits and distributes electricity, and provides natural gas transportation, storage and gathering services. These businesses are regulated by state public service commissions and/or the FERC. The construction materials and services platform provides construction services to a variety of industries, including commercial, industrial and governmental, and provides construction materials through aggregate mining and marketing of related products, such as ready-mixed concrete and asphalt. The Company is organized into five reportable business segments. These business segments include: electric, natural gas distribution, pipeline and midstream, construction materials and contracting, and construction services. The Company's business segments are determined based on the Company's method of internal reporting, which generally segregates the strategic business units due to differences in products, services and regulation. The internal reporting of these segments is defined based on the reporting and review process used by the Company's chief executive officer. The Company's strategy is to apply its expertise in the regulated energy delivery and construction materials and services businesses to increase market share, increase profitability and enhance shareholder value through organic growth opportunities and strategic acquisitions. The Company is focused on a disciplined approach to the acquisition of well-managed companies and properties. The Company has capabilities to fund its growth and operations through various sources, including internally generated funds, commercial paper facilities, revolving credit facilities and the issuance from time to time of debt and equity securities. For more information on the Company's capital expenditures, see Liquidity and Capital Commitments. Consolidated Earnings Overview The following table summarizes the contribution to the consolidated earnings by each of the Company's business segments. Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (In millions, except per share amounts) Electric $ 54.8 $ 47.0 $ 49.4 Natural gas distribution 39.5 37.7 32.2 Pipeline and midstream 29.6 28.5 20.5 Construction materials and contracting 120.4 92.6 123.4 Construction services 93.0 64.3 53.3 Other (2.1 ) (.7 ) (1.5 ) Intersegment eliminations 6.9 Earnings before discontinued operations 335.2 269.4 284.2 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax .3 2.9 (3.8 ) Earnings on common stock $ 335.5 $ 272.3 $ 280.4 Earnings per common share - basic: Earnings before discontinued operations $ 1.69 $ 1.38 $ 1.46 Discontinued operations, net of tax .01 (.02 ) Earnings per common share - basic $ 1.69 $ 1.39 $ 1.44 Earnings per common share - diluted: Earnings before discontinued operations $ 1.69 $ 1.38 $ 1.45 Discontinued operations, net of tax .01 (.02 ) Earnings per common share - diluted $ 1.69 $ 1.39 $ 1.43 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 33 Part II 2019 compared to 2018 The Company's consolidated earnings increased $63.2 million. Positively impacting the Company's earnings was an increase in gross margin at the construction services business, largely resulting from higher inside and outside specialty contracting workloads. Also contributing to the increase in earnings was an increase in gross margin at the construction materials and contracting business as a result of strong economic environments in certain states, as well as contributions from the businesses acquired and an increase in gains recognized on asset sales. The electric business also positively impacted earnings primarily due to approved rate relief in Montana and recovery of the investment in the BSSE project placed into service in the first quarter of 2019. Higher returns on the Company's benefit plan investments also increased earnings across all businesses. At the pipeline and midstream business, increased rates and volumes of natural gas being transported through its pipeline were mostly offset by the absence of a $4.2 million income tax benefit included in 2018, as discussed below, and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. 2018 compared to 2017 The Company's consolidated earnings decreased $8.1 million. The Company's earnings were positively impacted in 2018 as a result of the lower federal statutory tax rate, which was partially offset by the absence of a $39.5 million tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the revaluation of the business's net deferred tax liabilities. Both tax impacts were the result of the enactment of the TCJA, as further discussed in Item 8 - Note 14 . Decreased earnings due to lower returns on investments also offset the lower income tax rate. Also positively impacting the Company's earnings were higher outside specialty contracting gross margins due to increased outside equipment sales and rentals at the construction services business, as well as a $4.2 million income tax benefit relating to the reversal of a regulatory liability recorded in 2017 based on a FERC final accounting order issued during the third quarter of 2018 at the pipeline and midstream business. A discussion of key financial data from the Company's business segments follows. Business Segment Financial and Operating Data Following are key financial and operating data for each of the Company's business segments. Also included are highlights on key growth strategies, projections and certain assumptions for the Company and its subsidiaries and other matters of the Company's business segments. Many of these highlighted points are "forward-looking statements." For more information, see Part I - Forward-Looking Statements. There is no assurance that the Company's projections, including estimates for growth and changes in earnings, will in fact be achieved. Please refer to assumptions contained in this section, as well as the various important factors listed in Item 1A - Risk Factors. Changes in such assumptions and factors could cause actual future results to differ materially from the Company's growth and earnings projections. For information pertinent to various commitments and contingencies, see Item 8 - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a summary of the Company's business segments, see Item 8 - Note 16 . Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Strategy and challenges The electric and natural gas distribution segments provide electric and natural gas distribution services to customers, as discussed in Items 1 and 2 - Business Properties. Both segments strive to be a top performing utility company measured by integrity, safety, employee satisfaction, customer service and shareholder return, while continuing to focus on providing safe, environmentally friendly, reliable and competitively priced energy and related services to customers. The Company is focused on cultivating organic growth while managing operating costs and continues to monitor opportunities for these segments to retain, grow and expand their customer base through extensions of existing operations, including building and upgrading electric generation, transmission and distribution and natural gas systems, and through selected acquisitions of companies and properties with similar operating and growth objectives at prices that will provide stable cash flows and an opportunity to earn a competitive return on investment. The continued efforts to create operational improvements and efficiencies across both segments promotes the Company's business integration strategy. The primary factors that impact the results of these segments are the ability to earn authorized rates of return, the cost of natural gas, cost of electric fuel and purchased power, weather, competitive factors in the energy industry, population growth and economic conditions in the segments' service areas. The electric and natural gas distribution segments are subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions where they conduct operations with respect to costs, timely recovery of investments and permitted returns on investment, as well as certain operational, environmental and system integrity regulations. To assist in the reduction of regulatory lag with the increase in investments, tracking mechanisms have been implemented in certain jurisdictions, as further discussed in Items 1 and 2 - Business Properties and Item 8 - Note 19 . The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration recently issued additional rules to strengthen the safety of natural gas transmission and hazardous liquid pipelines. The Company is currently evaluating the first phase of the rules. Legislative and regulatory initiatives to increase renewable energy resources and reduce GHG emissions could impact the price and demand for electricity and natural gas, as well as increase costs to produce electricity and natural gas. The segments continue to invest in facility upgrades to be in compliance with the existing and future regulations. 34 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II Tariff increases on steel and aluminum materials could negatively affect the segments' construction projects and maintenance work. The Company continues to monitor the impact of tariffs on raw material costs. The natural gas distribution segment is also facing increased lead times on delivery of certain raw materials used in pipeline projects. In addition to the effect of tariffs, long lead times are attributable to increased demand for steel products from pipeline companies as they respond to the United States Department of Transportation Pipeline System Safety and Integrity Plan. The Company continues to monitor the material lead times and is working with manufacturers to proactively order such materials to help mitigate the risk of delays due to extended lead times. The ability to grow through acquisitions is subject to significant competition and acquisition premiums. In addition, the ability of the segments to grow their service territory and customer base is affected by the economic environment of the markets served and competition from other energy providers and fuels. The construction of any new electric generating facilities, transmission lines and other service facilities is subject to increasing costs and lead times, extensive permitting procedures, and federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives, which will likely necessitate increases in electric energy prices. Revenues are impacted by both customer growth and usage, the latter of which is primarily impacted by weather. Very cold winters increase demand for natural gas and to a lesser extent, electricity, while warmer than normal summers increase demand for electricity, especially among residential and commercial customers. Average consumption among both electric and natural gas customers has tended to decline as more efficient appliances and furnaces are installed, and as the Company has implemented conservation programs. Natural gas decoupling mechanisms in certain jurisdictions have been implemented to largely mitigate the effect that would otherwise be caused by variations in volumes sold to these customers due to weather and changing consumption patterns on the Company's distribution margins. Earnings overview - The following information summarizes the performance of the electric segment. Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (Dollars in millions, where applicable) Operating revenues $ 351.7 $ 335.1 $ 342.8 Electric fuel and purchased power 86.6 80.7 78.7 Taxes, other than income .6 .7 .8 Adjusted gross margin 264.5 253.7 263.3 Operating expenses: Operation and maintenance 125.7 123.0 122.2 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 58.7 51.0 47.7 Taxes, other than income 16.1 14.5 13.5 Total operating expenses 200.5 188.5 183.4 Operating income 64.0 65.2 79.9 Other income 3.4 1.2 3.2 Interest expense 25.3 25.9 25.4 Income before income taxes 42.1 40.5 57.7 Income taxes (12.7 ) (6.5 ) 7.7 Net income 54.8 47.0 50.0 Loss/dividends on preferred stock .6 Earnings $ 54.8 $ 47.0 $ 49.4 Retail sales (million kWh): Residential 1,177.9 1,196.6 1,153.5 Commercial 1,499.9 1,513.9 1,513.1 Industrial 549.4 551.0 539.9 Other 87.1 92.9 100.0 3,314.3 3,354.4 3,306.5 Average cost of electric fuel and purchased power per kWh $ .023 $ .022 $ .022 Adjusted gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information and reconciliation of the non-GAAP adjusted gross margin attributable to the electric segment, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section later in this Item. 2019 compared to 2018 Electric earnings increased $7.8 million ( 17 percent) as a result of: Adjusted gross margin: Increase of $10.8 million , primarily due to an increase in revenues. The revenue increase was driven by implemented regulatory mechanisms, which include approved Montana interim and final rates and recovery of the investment in the MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 35 Part II BSSE project placed into service in the first quarter of 2019. Also contributing to the increase was the absence in 2019 of a transmission formula rate adjustment recognized in the third quarter of 2018 for decreased costs on the BSSE project. These increases were partially offset by lower retail sales volumes of 1.2 percent across all major customer classes. Operation and maintenance: Increase of $2.7 million , primarily resulting from higher payroll-related costs, partially offset by lower material expenses across all locations. Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Increase of $7.7 million as a result of increased property, plant and equipment balances including the BSSE project, as previously discussed, and other capital projects, as well as a reserve for certain costs related to the retirement of three aging coal-fired electric generating units, as discussed in Item 8 - Note 7 , which is offset in income taxes. Taxes, other than income: Increase of $1.6 million , primarily from higher property taxes in certain jurisdictions. Other income: Increase of $2.2 million , largely the result of higher returns on the Company's benefit plan investments, partially offset by the write-down of a non-utility investment, as discussed in Item 8 - Note 8 . Interest expense: Decrease of $600,000 driven by higher AFUDC, which resulted in more interest being capitalized on regulated construction projects. Income taxes: Increase in income tax benefits of $6.2 million , largely due to increased production tax credits, as well as increased excess deferred tax amortization. 2018 compared to 2017 Electric earnings decreased $2.4 million (5 percent) as a result of: Adjusted gross margin: Decrease of $9.6 million , primarily due to lower operating revenues driven by the reserves against revenues in certain jurisdictions for anticipated refunds to customers for lower income taxes due to the enactment of TCJA and a transmission formula rate adjustment due to lower than anticipated project costs on the BSSE project recorded in the third quarter of 2018. Partially offsetting the decreases to adjusted gross margin were the absence in 2018 of reserves related to tracker balances in prior years and increased retail sales volumes of 1 percent to all major customer classes. Operation and maintenance: Increase of $800,000 , largely from higher contract services at certain generating stations. Partially offsetting the increase were lower payroll-related costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Increase of $3.3 million as a result of increased plant balances. Taxes, other than income: Increase of $1.0 million , primarily from higher property taxes in certain jurisdictions. Other income: Decrease of $2.0 million , largely the result of lower returns on investments. Interest expense: Comparable to the prior year. Income taxes: Decrease of $14.2 million , largely due to the enactment of the TCJA reduced corporate tax rate, reduced income before income taxes and the absence of $2.1 million of income tax expense in 2018 for the revaluation of nonutility net deferred tax assets in 2017. Partially offsetting these decreases were lower production tax credits. A portion of the reduction in income taxes are being reserved against revenues, as previously discussed, resulting in a minimal impact on overall earnings. 36 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II Earnings overview - The following information summarizes the performance of the natural gas distribution segment. Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (Dollars in millions, where applicable) Operating revenues $ 865.2 $ 823.2 $ 848.4 Purchased natural gas sold 477.6 454.8 479.9 Taxes, other than income 30.3 28.5 30.0 Adjusted gross margin 357.3 339.9 338.5 Operating expenses: Operation and maintenance 185.0 173.4 164.3 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 79.6 72.5 69.4 Taxes, other than income 23.5 21.7 20.5 Total operating expenses 288.1 267.6 254.2 Operating income 69.2 72.3 84.3 Other income 7.2 .2 2.0 Interest expense 35.5 30.7 31.2 Income before income taxes 40.9 41.8 55.1 Income taxes 1.4 4.1 22.8 Net income 39.5 37.7 32.3 Loss/dividends on preferred stock .1 Earnings $ 39.5 $ 37.7 $ 32.2 Volumes (MMdk) Retail sales: Residential 69.4 63.7 63.6 Commercial 49.1 44.4 44.3 Industrial 5.2 4.5 4.6 123.7 112.6 112.5 Transportation sales: Commercial 2.2 2.2 2.0 Industrial 163.9 147.3 142.5 166.1 149.5 144.5 Total throughput 289.8 262.1 257.0 Average cost of natural gas per dk $ 3.86 $ 4.04 $ 4.26 Adjusted gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information and reconciliation of the non-GAAP adjusted gross margin attributable to the natural gas distribution segment, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section later in this Item. 2019 compared to 2018 Natural gas distribution earnings increased $1.8 million ( 5 percent) as a result of: Adjusted gross margin: Increase of $17.4 million , primarily driven by an increase in retail sales volumes of 9.9 percent related to all customer classes due to colder weather, partially offset by weather normalization and conservation adjustments in certain jurisdictions, and approved rate recovery in certain jurisdictions. The adjusted gross margin was also positively impacted by higher rate realization due to higher conservation revenue, which offsets the conservation expense in operation and maintenance expense. Operation and maintenance: Increase of $11.6 million , largely related to higher payroll-related costs, as well as higher conservation expenses being recovered in revenue. The increase was partially offset by lower contract services, which includes the absence of the prior year's recognition of a non-recurring expense related to the approved WUTC general rate case settlement in the second quarter 2018. Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Increase of $7.1 million , primarily as a result of increased property, plant and equipment balances. Taxes, other than income: Increase of $1.8 million due to higher property taxes in certain jurisdictions and increased payroll taxes. Other income: Increase of $7.0 million , largely resulting from higher returns on the Company's benefit plan investments and increased interest income related to higher gas costs to be collected from customers, as discussed in Item 8 - Note 19 . Partially offsetting these increases was a write-down of a non-utility investment, as discussed in Item 8 - Note 8 . Interest expense: Increase of $4.8 million , largely resulting from increased debt balances to finance higher gas costs to be collected from customers, as discussed in Item 8 - Note 19 . MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 37 Part II Income taxes: Decrease of $2.7 million , largely due to increased permanent tax benefits related to the Company's benefit plan investments. 2018 compared to 2017 Natural gas distribution earnings increased $5.5 million (17 percent) as a result of: Adjusted gross margin: Increase of $1.4 million , primarily due to increased retail sales margins, mainly the result of weather normalization mechanisms in certain jurisdictions and conservation revenue, which offsets the conservation expense in operation and maintenance expense. Also contributing to the retail sales margin increase were higher basic service charges as a result of increased retail sales customers and rate design. These increases were partially offset by tax reform revenue impacts for refunds to customers as a result of lower income taxes due to the enactment of TCJA and lower volumes in certain jurisdictions. Operation and maintenance: Increase of $9.1 million , largely related to conservation expenses being recovered in revenue; contract services, which includes the recognition of a non-recurring expense related to the approved WUTC general rate case settlement in the second quarter 2018; and higher payroll-related costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Increase of $3.1 million , primarily as a result of increased plant balances offset in part by lower depreciation rates implemented in certain jurisdictions. Taxes, other than income: Increase of $1.2 million due to higher property taxes in certain jurisdictions. Other income: Decrease of $1.8 million , primarily the result of lower returns on investments. Interest expense: Comparable to the prior year. Income taxes: Decrease of $18.7 million , largely due to the enactment of the TCJA reduced corporate tax rate, as well as the absence of $4.3 million income tax expense related to the 2017 revaluation of nonutility net deferred tax assets, and reduced income before income taxes. A portion of the reduction in income taxes are being reserved against revenues or passed back to customers, as previously discussed, resulting in a minimal impact on overall earnings. Outlook The Company expects these segments will grow rate base by approximately 5 percent annually over the next five years on a compound basis. Operations are spread across eight states where the Company expects customer growth to be higher than the national average. Customer growth is expected to grow by 1 percent to 2 percent per year. This customer growth, along with system upgrades and replacements needed to supply safe and reliable service, will require investments in new and replacement electric generation and transmission and natural gas systems. In February 2019, the Company announced that it intends to retire three aging coal-fired electric generating units, resulting from the Company's analysis showing that the plants are no longer expected to be cost competitive for customers. The retirements are expected to be in early 2021 for Lewis & Clark Station in Sidney, Montana, and in early 2022 for units 1 and 2 at Heskett Station in Mandan, North Dakota. In addition, the Company announced that it intends to construct Heskett Unit 4, an 88-MW simple-cycle natural gas-fired combustion turbine peaking unit at the existing Heskett Station near Mandan, North Dakota. Heskett Unit 4 production costs coupled with the MISO market purchases are expected to be about half the total cost of continuing to run the coal-fired electric generating units at Heskett and Lewis & Clark stations. Heskett Unit 4 was included in the Company's recently submitted integrated resource plan. On August 28, 2019, the Company filed for an advanced determination of prudence with the NDPSC for Heskett Unit 4. If approved, Heskett Unit 4 is expected to be placed into service in 2023. The Company filed requests for the usage of deferred accounting for the costs related to the retirement of Lewis & Clark Station and units 1 and 2 at Heskett Station with the NDPSC on September 16, 2019, the MTPSC on November 1, 2019 and the SDPUC on November 8, 2019. The SDPUC approved the use of deferred accounting as requested on January 7, 2020. The Company continues to be focused on the regulatory recovery of its investments. The Company files for rate adjustments to seek recovery of operating costs and capital investments, as well as reasonable returns as allowed by regulators. The Company's most recent cases by jurisdiction are discussed in Item 8 - Note 19 . 38 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II Pipeline and Midstream Strategy and challenges The pipeline and midstream segment provides natural gas transportation, gathering and underground storage services, as discussed in Items 1 and 2 - Business Properties. The segment focuses on utilizing its extensive expertise in the design, construction and operation of energy infrastructure and related services to increase market share and profitability through optimization of existing operations, organic growth and investments in energy-related assets within or in close proximity to its current operating areas. The segment focuses on the continual safety and reliability of its systems, which entails building, operating and maintaining safe natural gas pipelines and facilities. The segment continues to evaluate growth opportunities including the expansion of existing storage, gathering and transmission facilities; incremental pipeline projects; and expansion of energy-related services leveraging on its core competencies. In support of this strategy, the Company completed and placed into service the following projects in 2019 and 2018: In November 2019, Phase I of the Line Section 22 Expansion project in the Billings, Montana, area increased capacity by 14.3 MMcf per day. In September 2019, the Demicks Lake project in McKenzie County, North Dakota, increased capacity by 175 MMcf per day. In November 2018, the Valley Expansion project in eastern North Dakota and far western Minnesota increased capacity by 40 MMcf per day. In September 2018, the Line Section 27 Expansion project in the Bakken area of northwestern North Dakota increased capacity by over 200 MMcf per day and brought the total capacity of Line Section 27 to over 600 MMcf per day. The segment is exposed to energy price volatility which is impacted by the fluctuations in pricing, production and basis differentials of the energy market's commodities. Legislative and regulatory initiatives to increase pipeline safety regulations and reduce methane emissions could also impact the price and demand for natural gas. Tariff increases on steel and aluminum materials could negatively affect the segment's construction projects and maintenance work. The Company continues to monitor the impact of tariffs on raw material costs. The segment experiences extended lead times on raw materials that are critical to the segment's construction and maintenance work. Long lead times on materials could delay maintenance work and project construction potentially causing lost revenues and/or increased costs. The Company continues to proactively monitor and plan for the material lead times, as well as work with manufacturers and suppliers to help mitigate the risk of delays due to extended lead times. The pipeline and midstream segment is subject to extensive regulation including certain operational, environmental and system integrity regulations, as well as various permit terms and operational compliance conditions. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration recently issued additional rules to strengthen the safety of natural gas transmission and storage facilities and hazardous liquid pipelines. The Company is currently evaluating the first phase of the rules. The segment is charged with the ongoing process of reviewing existing permits and easements, as well as securing new permits and easements as necessary to meet current demand and future growth opportunities. Exposure to pipeline opposition groups could also cause negative impacts on the segment with increased costs and potential delays to project completion. The segment focuses on the recruitment and retention of a skilled workforce to remain competitive and provide services to its customers. The industry in which it operates relies on a skilled workforce to construct energy infrastructure and operate existing infrastructure in a safe manner. A shortage of skilled personnel can create a competitive labor market which could increase costs incurred by the segment. Competition from other pipeline and midstream companies can also have a negative impact on the segment. MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 39 Part II Earnings overview - The following information summarizes the performance of the pipeline and midstream segment. Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (Dollars in millions) Operating revenues $ 140.4 $ 128.9 $ 122.2 Operating expenses: Operation and maintenance 63.1 62.2 56.9 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 21.2 17.9 16.8 Taxes, other than income 13.3 12.7 12.5 Total operating expenses 97.6 92.8 86.2 Operating income 42.8 36.1 36.0 Other income 1.2 1.0 1.8 Interest expense 7.2 5.9 5.0 Income before income taxes 36.8 31.2 32.8 Income taxes 7.2 2.7 12.3 Net income $ 29.6 $ 28.5 $ 20.5 Transportation volumes (MMdk) 429.7 351.5 312.5 Natural gas gathering volumes (MMdk) 13.9 14.9 16.1 Customer natural gas storage balance (MMdk): Beginning of period 13.9 22.4 26.4 Net injection (withdrawal) 2.3 (8.5 ) (4.0 ) End of period 16.2 13.9 22.4 2019 compared to 2018 Pipeline and midstream earnings increased $1.1 million ( 4 percent) as a result of: Revenues: Increase of $11.5 million , largely attributable to increased volumes of natural gas transported through its system as a result of organic growth projects, as previously discussed in Strategy and challenges, and increased rates effective May 1, 2019, due to the FERC rate case finalized in September 2019. Operation and maintenance: Increase of $900,000 , primarily from higher payroll-related costs and materials costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Increase of $3.3 million , primarily due to increased property, plant and equipment balances, largely the result of organic growth projects that have been placed into service, and higher depreciation rates effective May 1, 2019, due to the FERC rate case finalized in September 2019. Taxes, other than income: Increase of $600,000 driven by higher property taxes in certain jurisdictions. Other income: Comparable to the prior year. Interest expense: Increase of $1.3 million , largely resulting from higher debt balances to finance organic growth projects, as previously discussed. Income taxes: Increase of $4.5 million , primarily driven by the absence in 2019 of a $4.2 million income tax benefit, as discussed later. 2018 compared to 2017 Pipeline and midstream earnings increased $8.0 million (39 percent) as a result of: Revenues: Increase of $6.7 million , largely attributable to increased volumes of natural gas transported through its system as a result of completed organic growth projects, as previously discussed in Strategy and challenges, and higher nonregulated project workloads, which increased revenues $4.1 million. These increases were partially offset by decreased storage-related revenues reflecting the decrease in natural gas pricing spreads, as discussed in the Outlook section. Operation and maintenance: Increase of $5.3 million , primarily from higher nonregulated project costs of $3.9 million directly related to the increase in nonregulated project workloads, as previously discussed, as well as higher professional services, material costs and contract services. Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Increase of $1.1 million , largely resulting from organic growth projects. Taxes, other than income: Comparable to the prior year. Other income: Decrease of $800,000 , primarily the result of lower returns on investments partially offset by higher AFUDC. Interest expense: Increase of $900,000 , largely resulting from higher debt balances. 40 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II Income taxes: Decrease of $9.6 million , primarily resulting from the lower corporate tax rate due to the enactment of the TCJA creating a reduction to income tax expense, as well as the realization of a $4.2 million income tax benefit related to the reversal of a regulatory liability recorded in 2017 based on a FERC final accounting order issued during third quarter of 2018. Outlook The Company has continued to experience the effects of natural gas production at record levels, which has provided opportunities for organic growth projects and increased demand. The completion of organic growth projects has contributed to the Company transporting increasing volumes of natural gas through its system. The record levels of natural gas supply have moderated the need for storage services and put downward pressure on natural gas prices and minimized pricing volatility. Both natural gas production levels and pressure on natural gas prices are expected to continue in the near term. The Company continues to focus on growth and improving existing operations through organic projects in all areas in which it operates. The following describes current growth projects. The Company began construction on the Line Section 22 Expansion project in the Billings, Montana, area in May 2019. Phase I of the project was placed into service in November 2019, as previously discussed. Phase II has an expected in-service date in the first quarter of 2020 and is designed to increase capacity by 8.2 MMcf per day to serve incremental demand in Billings, Montana. The Company has signed long-term contracts supporting the project. The Company began construction on the Demicks Lake Expansion project, located in McKenzie County, North Dakota, in November 2019. In February 2020, the Company completed and placed the project into service. The Company has signed a long-term contract supporting this project, which increased capacity by 175 MMcf per day. In January 2019, the Company announced the North Bakken Expansion project, which includes construction of a new pipeline, compression and ancillary facilities to transport natural gas from core Bakken production areas near Tioga, North Dakota, to a new connection with Northern Border Pipeline in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Company's long-term customer commitments and anticipated incremental commitments with the continuing record levels of natural gas production in the Bakken region support the project at a design capacity of 350 MMcf per day. Construction is expected to begin in early 2021 with an estimated completion date late in 2021, which is dependent on regulatory and environmental permitting. On June 28, 2019, the Company filed with the FERC a request to initiate the National Environmental Policy Act pre-filing process and received FERC approval of the pre-filing request on July 3, 2019. In December 2019, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Scout Energy Group II, LP to divest of its regulated gathering assets located in Montana and North Dakota, which includes approximately 400 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines and associated compression and ancillary facilities. On January 8, 2020, the Company filed an application with the FERC to authorize abandonment by sale of the gathering assets. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2020 with an effective date of January 1, 2020, pending approval by the FERC. Construction Materials and Contracting Strategy and challenges The construction materials and contracting segment provides an integrated set of aggregate-based construction services, as discussed in Items 1 and 2 - Business Properties. The segment focuses on high-growth strategic markets located near major transportation corridors and desirable mid-sized metropolitan areas; strengthening the long-term, strategic aggregate reserve position through available purchase and/or lease opportunities; enhancing profitability through cost containment, margin discipline and vertical integration of the segment's operations; development and recruitment of talented employees; and continued growth through organic and acquisition opportunities. A key element of the Company's long-term strategy for this business is to further expand its market presence in the higher-margin materials business (rock, sand, gravel, liquid asphalt, asphalt concrete, ready-mixed concrete and related products), complementing and expanding on the segment's expertise. The Company's acquisition activity supports this strategy. As one of the country's largest sand and gravel producers, the segment continues to strategically manage its approximately 1.1 billion tons of aggregate reserves in all its markets, as well as take further advantage of being vertically integrated. The segment's vertical integration allows the segment to manage operations from aggregate mining to final lay-down of concrete and asphalt, with control of and access to permitted aggregate reserves being significant. The Company's aggregate reserves are naturally declining and as a result, the Company seeks acquisition opportunities to replace the reserves. In the first quarter of 2019, the Company purchased additional aggregate deposits in Texas that are estimated to contain a 40-year supply of high-quality aggregates. Also during 2019, the Company increased aggregate reserves by approximately 40 million tons largely due to strategic asset purchases. The construction materials and contracting segment faces challenges that are not under the direct control of the business. The segment operates in geographically diverse and highly competitive markets. Competition can put negative pressure on the segment's operating margins. The segment is also subject to volatility in the cost of raw materials such as diesel fuel, gasoline, liquid asphalt, cement and steel. Although it is difficult to determine the split between inflation and supply/demand increases, diesel fuel costs remained fairly stable in MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 41 Part II 2019 , while asphalt oil costs trended higher in 2019 as compared to 2018 . Such volatility can have a negative impact on the segment's margins. Other variables that can impact the segment's margins include adverse weather conditions, the timing of project starts or completion and declines or delays in new and existing projects due to the cyclical nature of the construction industry and governmental infrastructure spending. The segment also faces challenges in the recruitment and retention of employees. Trends in the labor market include an aging workforce and availability issues. The segment continues to face increasing pressure to control costs, as well as find and train a skilled workforce to meet the needs of increasing demand and seasonal work. Earnings overview - The following information summarizes the performance of the construction materials and contracting segment. Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (Dollars in millions) Operating revenues $ 2,190.7 $ 1,925.9 $ 1,812.5 Cost of sales: Operation and maintenance 1,798.3 1,601.7 1,500.1 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 74.3 59.0 52.5 Taxes, other than income 44.1 39.7 38.0 Total cost of sales 1,916.7 1,700.4 1,590.6 Gross margin 274.0 225.5 221.9 Selling, general and administrative expense: Operation and maintenance 86.3 77.6 71.5 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 3.1 2.2 3.4 Taxes, other than income 4.6 4.3 3.8 Total selling, general and administrative expense 94.0 84.1 78.7 Operating income 180.0 141.4 143.2 Other income (expense) 1.6 (3.1 ) .4 Interest expense 23.8 17.3 14.8 Income before income taxes 157.8 121.0 128.8 Income taxes 37.4 28.4 5.4 Net income $ 120.4 $ 92.6 $ 123.4 Sales (000's): Aggregates (tons) 32,314 29,795 28,213 Asphalt (tons) 6,707 6,838 6,237 Ready-mixed concrete (cubic yards) 4,123 3,518 3,548 2019 compared to 2018 Construction materials and contracting's earnings increased $27.8 million ( 30 percent) as a result of: Revenues: Increase of $264.8 million driven by higher contracting services and material sales due to strong economic environments in certain states, as well as additional material volumes associated with the businesses acquired. Gross margin: Increase of $48.5 million , largely resulting from higher revenues due to strong economic environments in certain states, as previously discussed, higher contracting bid margins and higher realized material prices. Also contributing to the increased gross margin was an increase in gains on asset sales in certain regions of approximately $7.5 million. Selling, general and administrative expense: Increase of $9.9 million , primarily related to the businesses acquired and higher payroll-related costs. Other income (expense): Increase d income of $4.7 million , largely the result of higher returns on the Company's benefit plan investments. Interest expense: Increase of $6.5 million , largely resulting from higher debt balances as a result of recent acquisitions, capital expenditures and higher average interest rates. Income taxes: Increase of $9.0 million directly resulting from an increase in income before taxes. 42 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II 2018 compared to 2017 Construction materials and contracting's earnings decreased $30.8 million (25 percent) as a result of: Revenues: Increase of $113.4 million driven by higher asphalt product and aggregate volumes due to increased agency demand, increased realized prices and lower material costs. Partially offsetting these increases were lower ready-mixed concrete volumes due to a decrease in available work and unfavorable weather conditions in certain regions. Gross margin: Increase of $3.6 million resulting from higher asphalt product volumes and margins, largely from recent acquisitions and higher realized prices. Also contributing to the increase were higher aggregate volumes and margins due to strong market demand and lower material costs. Partially offsetting these increases were lower ready-mixed concrete volumes and margins due to a decrease in available work and unfavorable weather conditions in certain regions. Selling, general and administrative expense: Increase of $5.4 million , primarily payroll-related costs, acquisition costs and higher insurance-related costs. Other income (expense): Decrease of $3.5 million , largely the result of lower returns on investments. Interest expense: Increase of $2.5 million , largely resulting from higher debt balances as a result of recent acquisitions, capital expenditures and higher working capital needs. Income taxes: Increase of $23.0 million , primarily resulting from the absence in 2018 of a $41.9 million tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the revaluation of the segment's net deferred tax liabilities. Partially offsetting this increase were lower income taxes due to the enactment of the TCJA, which reduced the corporate tax rate. Outlook The segment's vertically integrated aggregate-based business model provides the Company with the ability to capture margin throughout the sales delivery process. The aggregate products are sold internally and externally for use in other products such as ready-mixed concrete, asphaltic concrete and public and private construction markets. The contracting services and construction materials are sold primarily to construction contractors in connection with street, highway and other public infrastructure projects, as well as private commercial and residential development projects. The public infrastructure projects have traditionally been more stable markets as public funding is more secure during periods of economic decline. The public funding is, however, dependent on state and federal funding such as appropriations to the Federal Highway Administration. Spending on private development is highly dependent on both local and national economic cycles, providing additional sales during times of strong economic cycles. The Company remains optimistic about overall economic growth and infrastructure spending. The IBISWorld Incorporated Industry Report issued in June 2019 for sand and gravel mining in the United States projects a 1.1 percent annual growth rate through 2024. The report also states the demand for clay and refractory materials is projected to continue deteriorating in several downstream manufacturing industries. However, the report expects this decline will be offset by rising activity in the residential and nonresidential construction markets, growing public sector investment in the highway and bridge construction markets and the oil and gas sector growth. The Company believes stronger demand in the housing construction markets along with continued demand from the highway and bridge construction markets should provide a stable demand for construction materials and contracting products and services in the near future. During 2019 and 2018, the Company made strategic asset purchases and acquired businesses that support the Company's long-term strategy to expand its market presence. In the first quarter of 2019, t he Company purchased additional aggregate deposits in Texas, which augments the segment's existing operations and enhances its ability to sell aggregates to third parties in the coming years. Also, in the first quarter of 2019, the Company acquired Viesko Redi-Mix, Inc., a ready mixed concrete supplier headquartered near Salem, Oregon. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company acquired Roadrunner Ready Mix, Inc., a ready-mixed concrete supplier in Idaho. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company acquired the assets of Oldcastle Infrastructure Spokane, a prestressed-concrete business located in Spokane, Washington. The Company continues to evaluate additional acquisition opportunities. For more information on the Company's business combinations, see Item 8 - Note 3 . The construction materials and contracting segment had backlog at December 31, 2019 , of $693 million , which was comparable to backlog at December 31, 2018 , of $706 million . The Company expects to complete a significant amount of backlog at December 31, 2019 , during the next 12 months. During the second quarter of 2019, the governor of Oregon signed House Bill 3427, which creates a Corporate Activity Tax. The tax was enacted in the third quarter of 2019 and was effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. The Company expects the additional taxation will be less than $2.0 million annually at the construction materials and contracting segment, which is dependent on the level of taxable commercial activity in Oregon. Construction Services Strategy and challenges The construction services segment provides inside and outside specialty contracting, as discussed in Items 1 and 2 - Business Properties. The construction services segment focuses on safely executing projects; providing a superior return on investment by MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 43 Part II building new and strengthening existing customer relationships; ensuring quality service; effectively controlling costs; collecting on receivables; retaining, developing and recruiting talented employees; growing through organic and acquisition opportunities; and focusing efforts on projects that will permit higher margins while properly managing risk. The growth experienced by the segment in recent years is due in part to its ability to support national customers in most of the regions in which they operate. The construction services segment faces challenges in the highly competitive markets in which it operates. Competitive pricing environments, project delays, changes in management's estimates of variable consideration and the effects from restrictive regulatory requirements have negatively impacted revenues and margins in the past and could affect revenues and margins in the future. Additionally, margins may be negatively impacted on a quarterly basis due to adverse weather conditions, as well as timing of project starts or completions, declines or delays in new projects due to the cyclical nature of the construction industry and other factors. These challenges may also impact the risk of loss on certain projects. Accordingly, operating results in any particular period may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other period. The need to ensure available specialized labor resources for projects also drives strategic relationships with customers and project margins. These trends include an aging workforce and labor availability issues, increasing pressure to reduce costs and improve reliability, and increasing duration and complexity of customer capital programs. Due to these and other factors, the Company believes overall customer and competitor demand for labor resources will continue to increase, possibly surpassing the supply of industry resources. Earnings overview - The following information summarizes the performance of the construction services segment. Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Operating revenues $ 1,849.3 $ 1,371.5 $ 1,367.6 Cost of sales: Operation and maintenance 1,555.4 1,150.4 1,153.9 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 15.0 14.3 14.2 Taxes, other than income 58.8 42.0 43.4 Total cost of sales 1,629.2 1,206.7 1,211.5 Gross margin 220.1 164.8 156.1 Selling, general and administrative expense: Operation and maintenance 87.0 72.2 69.3 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.0 1.4 1.5 Taxes, other than income 4.7 4.4 4.0 Total selling, general and administrative expense 93.7 78.0 74.8 Operating income 126.4 86.8 81.3 Other income 1.9 1.1 1.3 Interest expense 5.3 3.6 3.7 Income before income taxes 123.0 84.3 78.9 Income taxes 30.0 20.0 25.6 Net income $ 93.0 $ 64.3 $ 53.3 2019 compared to 2018 Construction services earnings increased $28.7 million ( 45 percent) as a result of: Revenues: Increase of $477.8 million , largely resulting from higher inside specialty contracting workloads from an increase in customer demand for hospitality, data center and high-tech projects. Also contributing to the increase was higher outside specialty contracting workloads, primarily resulting from increased utility customer demand. Gross margin: Increase of $55.3 million , primarily due to the higher volume of work resulting in an increase in revenues, as previously discussed, partially offset by an increase in operation and maintenance expense as a direct result of the increased workloads. Selling, general and administrative expense: Increase of $15.7 million , resulting from increased payroll-related costs, as well as higher office expense and outside professional service costs. Other income: Increase of $800,000 , largely resulting from higher returns on the Company's benefit plan investments. Interest expense: Increase of $1.7 million , related to higher debt balances as a result of additional working capital needs from the increase in contracting workloads in 2019. Income taxes: Increase of $10.0 million , directly resulting from an increase in income before taxes. 44 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II 2018 compared to 2017 Construction services earnings increased $11.0 million (21 percent) as a result of: Revenues: Comparable to the prior year. Gross margin: Increase of $8.7 million , largely resulting from higher outside specialty contracting gross margins due to increased outside equipment sales and rentals. Partially offsetting the increase were decreased inside specialty contracting gross margins as a result of decreased workloads and customer demand. Selling, general and administrative expense: Increase of $3.2 million , primarily higher office expense, outside professional costs and payroll-related costs. Other income: Comparable to the prior year. Interest expense: Comparable to the prior year. Income taxes: Decrease of $5.6 million , largely the lower corporate tax rate due to the enactment of the TCJA. Outlook The Company expects bidding activity to remain strong for both inside and outside specialty construction companies in 2020. Although bidding remains highly competitive in all areas, the Company expects the segment's skilled workforce, quality of service and effective cost management will continue to provide a benefit in securing and executing profitable projects. The construction services segment had backlog at December 31, 2019 , of $1.1 billion , up from $939 million at December 31, 2018 . The 22 percent increase in backlog was largely attributable to the new project opportunities that the Company continues to be awarded across its diverse operations, particularly inside specialty electrical and mechanical contracting in the hospitality, high-tech, mission critical and public industries. The Company's outside power, communications and natural gas specialty contracting also have a high volume of available work. The Company expects to complete a significant amount of backlog at December 31, 2019 , during the next 12 months. Additionally, the Company continues to further evaluate potential acquisition opportunities that would be accretive to the Company and continue to grow the Company's backlog. In support of the Company's strategic plan to grow through acquisitions, the Company purchased the assets of Pride Electric, Inc., an electrical construction company in Redmond, Washington, in the third quarter of 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company acquired PerLectric, Inc., an electrical construction company in Fairfax, Virginia. For more information on the Company's business combinations, see Item 8 - Note 3 . During the second quarter of 2019, the governor of Oregon signed House Bill 3427, which creates a Corporate Activity Tax. The tax was enacted in the third quarter of 2019 and was effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. The Company expects the additional taxation will be less than $2.0 million annually at the construction services segment, which is dependent on the level of taxable commercial activity in Oregon. Other Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Operating revenues $ 16.6 $ 11.3 $ 7.9 Operating expenses: Operation and maintenance 15.6 9.3 6.3 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.1 2.0 2.0 Taxes, other than income .1 .1 .2 Total operating expenses 17.8 11.4 8.5 Operating loss (1.2 ) (.1 ) (.6 ) Other income .9 1.0 .9 Interest expense 1.9 2.8 3.6 Loss before income taxes (2.2 ) (1.9 ) (3.3 ) Income taxes (.1 ) (1.2 ) (1.8 ) Net loss $ (2.1 ) $ (.7 ) $ (1.5 ) Included in Other is insurance activity at the Company's captive insurer which impacts both operating revenues and operation and maintenance expense. General and administrative costs and interest expense previously allocated to the exploration and production and refining businesses that do not meet the criteria for income (loss) from discontinued operations are also included in Other. Additionally, MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 45 Part II operation and maintenance expense in 2018 included costs associated with the Holding Company Reorganization. For further details on the Company's reorganization, see Items 1 and 2 Business Properties - General. Discontinued Operations Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Income from discontinued operations before intercompany eliminations, net of tax $ .3 $ 2.9 $ 3.1 Intercompany eliminations (6.9 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax $ .3 $ 2.9 $ (3.8 ) Included in discontinued operations are the results and supporting activities of Dakota Prairie Refining and Fidelity other than certain general and administrative costs and interest expense. The loss in 2017 was largely attributable to eliminations for the presentation of income tax adjustments between continuing and discontinued operations. Intersegment Transactions Amounts presented in the preceding tables will not agree with the Consolidated Statements of Income due to the Company's elimination of intersegment transactions. The amounts related to these items were as follows: Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Intersegment transactions: Operating revenues $ 77.1 $ 64.3 $ 58.0 Operation and maintenance 21.1 13.7 9.1 Purchased natural gas sold 56.0 50.6 48.9 Income from continuing operations* (6.9 ) * Includes eliminations for the presentation of income tax adjustments between continuing and discontinued operations. For more information on intersegment eliminations, see Item 8 - Note 16 . Liquidity and Capital Commitments At December 31, 2019 , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $66.5 million and available borrowing capacity of $ 644.4 million under the outstanding credit facilities of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company expects to meet its obligations for debt maturing within one year and its other operating and capital requirements from various sources, including internally generated funds; the Company's credit facilities, as described later in Capital resources; the issuance of long-term debt; and issuance of equity securities. Cash flows Operating activities The changes in cash flows from operating activities generally follow the results of operations as discussed in Business Segment Financial and Operating Data and are also affected by changes in working capital. Changes in cash flows for discontinued operations are related to the Company's former exploration and production and refining businesses. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2019 increased $42.4 million from 2018 . The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in 2019 was largely driven by increased earnings from higher workloads at the construction businesses, which were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable as a result of the higher workloads. Lower inventory balances due to higher workloads at the construction materials and contracting business in 2019 as compared to the increase in inventory balances in 2018 due to the activity of acquired businesses also contributed to the increase. Partially offsetting these increases were higher natural gas purchases including the effects of colder weather, higher gas costs and the timing of collection of such balances from customers at the natural gas distribution business, as well as higher pension contributions at all of the businesses. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2018 increased $51.9 million from 2017 . The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was largely driven by stronger collection of accounts receivable at the construction services and construction materials and contracting businesses and bonus depreciation for tax purposes due to the enactment of TCJA at the construction materials and contracting business. Partially offsetting these increases were higher inventory balances at the construction materials and contracting business due to higher asphalt oil inventory, largely resulting from higher average per ton cost, and higher aggregate inventory from higher production. Also 46 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II contributing to the decrease were decreased deferral of production tax credits, re-measurements of taxes on investments and accelerated tax deductions related to TCJA. Investing activities Cash flows used in investing activities in 2019 decreased $107.0 million from 2018 . The decrease in cash used was primarily related to $112.1 million lower cash used in acquisition activity in 2019 compared to 2018 at the construction materials and contracting business and higher proceeds on asset sales at the construction businesses in 2019. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2018 increased $496.7 million from 2017 . The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to acquisition activity in 2018 at the construction materials and contracting business; the absence in 2018 of net proceeds from the sale of Pronghorn in January 2017 and higher capital expenditures in 2018 at the pipeline and midstream business; and higher capital expenditures related to various construction projects in 2018 at the electric and natural gas distribution businesses. Financing activities Cash flows provided by financing activities in 2019 decreased $156.3 million from 2018 . The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was largely due to the higher repayment of long-term debt in 2019 on debt issued in 2018 for acquisitions at the construction materials and contracting business. The Company also borrowed and repaid short-term borrowings in 2019 . Partially offsetting the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of common stock. The Company issued common stock for net proceeds of $106.8 million under its "at-the-market" offering and 401(k) plan in 2019 . Cash flows provided by financing activities in 2018 increased $475.7 million from 2017 . The increase in cash provided by financing activities was largely due to increased debt issuance from an increase in commercial paper balances used for acquisitions, ongoing capital expenditures and working capital needs at the construction materials and contacting business; the issuance of an additional $200 million in term loans for capital projects at the electric and natural gas distribution businesses; and the issuance of an additional $40 million under the private shelf agreement for capital projects at the pipeline and midstream business. The increase in issuance of long-term debt was partially offset by higher debt repayment on a line of credit at the natural gas distribution business; higher debt repayment on debt that matured during third quarter 2018 at the electric and natural gas distribution businesses; and the strong collection of accounts receivable resulting in lower commercial paper balances at the construction services business. Defined benefit pension plans The Company has noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plans for certain employees. Plan assets consist of investments in equity and fixed-income securities. Various actuarial assumptions are used in calculating the benefit expense (income) and liability (asset) related to the pension plans. Actuarial assumptions include assumptions about the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. At December 31, 2019 , the pension plans' accumulated benefit obligations exceeded these plans' assets by approximately $55.9 million . Pretax pension expense reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , was $2.5 million , $843,000 and $1.7 million , respectively. The Company's pension expense is currently projected to be approximately $300,000 in 2020 . Funding for the pension plans is actuarially determined. The minimum required contributions for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , were approximately $4.9 million and $6.1 million , respectively. There were no minimum required contributions for the year ended December 31, 2017 . For more information on the Company's pension plans, see Item 8 - Note 17 . Capital expenditures The Company's capital expenditures from continuing operations for 2017 through 2019 and as anticipated for 2020 through 2022 are summarized in the following table. Actual* Estimated 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 (In millions) Capital expenditures: Electric $ 109 $ 186 $ 99 $ 111 $ 128 $ 139 Natural gas distribution 147 206 207 221 191 180 Pipeline and midstream 31 70 71 85 304 53 Construction materials and contracting 44 280 190 167 154 157 Construction services 19 25 61 61 20 20 Other 2 2 8 5 3 3 Total capital expenditures $ 352 $ 769 $ 636 $ 650 $ 800 $ 552 * Capital expenditures for 2019, 2018 and 2017 include noncash transactions such as the issuance of the Company's equity securities in connection with acquisitions, capital expenditure-related accounts payable and AFUDC, totaling $4.8 million , $33.4 million and $10.5 million , respectively. MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 47 Part II The 2019 capital expenditures include the two business combinations at the construction materials and contracting segment and one business combination at the construction services segment, as discussed in Item 8 - Note 3 . The 2019 capital expenditures were funded by internal sources, issuance of long-term debt and issuance of the Company's equity securities. The Company has included in the estimated capital expenditures for 2020 through 2022 the Demicks Lake Expansion project, North Bakken Expansion project, construction of Heskett Unit 4 and the recently completed business combination at the construction services segment, as previously discussed in Business Segment Financial and Operating Data . Estimated capital expenditures for the years 2020 through 2022 include those for: System upgrades Routine replacements Service extensions Routine equipment maintenance and replacements Buildings, land and building improvements Pipeline and natural gas storage projects Power generation and transmission opportunities Environmental upgrades Other growth opportunities The Company continues to evaluate potential future acquisitions and other growth opportunities that would be incremental to the outlined capital program; however, they are dependent upon the availability of economic opportunities and, as a result, capital expenditures may vary significantly from the estimates in the preceding table. It is anticipated that all of the funds required for capital expenditures for the years 2020 through 2022 will be funded by various sources, including internally generated funds; the Company's credit facilities, as described later; and issuance of debt and equity securities. Capital resources Certain debt instruments of the Company's subsidiaries, including those discussed later, contain restrictive and financial covenants and cross-default provisions. In order to borrow under the debt agreements, the subsidiary companies must be in compliance with the applicable covenants and certain other conditions, all of which the subsidiaries, as applicable, were in compliance with at December 31, 2019 . In the event the subsidiaries do not comply with the applicable covenants and other conditions, alternative sources of funding may need to be pursued. For more information on the covenants, certain other conditions and cross-default provisions, see Item 8 - Note 9 . The following table summarizes the outstanding revolving credit facilities of the Company's subsidiaries at December 31, 2019 : Company Facility Facility Limit Amount Outstanding Letters of Credit Expiration Date (In millions) Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. Commercial paper/Revolving credit agreement (a) $ 175.0 $ 118.6 (b) $ 12/19/24 Cascade Natural Gas Corporation Revolving credit agreement $ 100.0 (c) $ 64.6 $ 2.2 (d) 6/7/24 Intermountain Gas Company Revolving credit agreement $ 85.0 (e) $ 24.5 $ 1.4 (d) 6/7/24 Centennial Energy Holdings, Inc. Commercial paper/Revolving credit agreement (f) $ 600.0 $ 104.3 (b) $ 12/19/24 (a) The commercial paper program is supported by a revolving credit agreement with various banks (provisions allow for increased borrowings, at the option of Montana-Dakota on stated conditions, up to a maximum of $225.0 million ). There were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. (b) Amount outstanding under commercial paper program. (c) Certain provisions allow for increased borrowings, up to a maximum of $125.0 million . (d) Outstanding letter(s) of credit reduce the amount available under the credit agreement. (e) Certain provisions allow for increased borrowings, up to a maximum of $110.0 million . (f) The commercial paper program is supported by a revolving credit agreement with various banks (provisions allow for increased borrowings, at the option of Centennial on stated conditions, up to a maximum of $700.0 million ). There were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. The respective commercial paper programs are supported by revolving credit agreements. While the amount of commercial paper outstanding does not reduce available capacity under the respective revolving credit agreements, Montana-Dakota and Centennial do not issue commercial paper in an aggregate amount exceeding the available capacity under their credit agreements. The commercial paper borrowings may vary during the period, largely the result of fluctuations in working capital requirements due to the seasonality of certain operations of the Company's subsidiaries. 48 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II Total equity as a percent of total capitalization was 56 percent and 55 percent at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. This ratio is calculated as the Company's total equity, divided by the Company's total capital. Total capital is the Company's total debt, including short-term borrowings and long-term debt due within one year, plus total equity. This ratio is an indicator of how the Company is financing its operations, as well as its financial strength. The Company currently has a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, under which the Company may issue and sell any combination of common stock and debt securities. The Company may sell such securities if warranted by market conditions and the Company's capital requirements. Any public offer and sale of such securities will be made only by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Company's board of directors currently has authorized the issuance and sale of up to an aggregate of $1.0 billion worth of such securities. The Company's board of directors reviews this authorization on a periodic basis and the aggregate amount of securities authorized may be increased in the future. On February 22, 2019, the Company entered into a Distribution Agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and MUFG Securities Americas Inc., as sales agents, with respect to the issuance and sale of up to 10.0 million shares of the Company's common stock in connection with an at-the-market offering. The common stock may be offered for sale, from time to time, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement. Proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock under the agreement have been and are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures, debt repayment and the financing of acquisitions. The Company issued 3.6 million shares of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2019 , pursuant to the at-the-market offering. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company received net proceeds of $94.0 million and paid commissions to the sales agents of approximately $950,000 in connection with the sales of common stock under the "at-the-market" offering. The net proceeds were used for capital expenditures and acquisitions. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had remaining capacity to issue up to 6.4 million additional shares of common stock under the "at-the-market" offering program. Certain of the Company's debt instruments use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The Company has been proactive to anticipate the reform of LIBOR by replacing it with Secured Overnight Financing Rate in certain of its new debt instruments, as well as those that are being renewed. The Company continues to evaluate the impact the reform will have on its debt instruments and, at this time, does not anticipate a significant impact. The following includes information related to the preceding table. Montana-Dakota On January 1, 2019, the Company's revolving credit agreement and commercial paper program became Montana-Dakota's revolving credit agreement and commercial paper program as a result of the Holding Company Reorganization. The outstanding balance of the revolving credit agreement was also transferred to Montana-Dakota. All of the related terms and covenants of the credit agreements remained the same. On December 19, 2019, Montana-Dakota amended and restated its revolving credit agreement extending the maturity date to December 19, 2024. Montana-Dakota's revolving credit agreement supports its commercial paper program. Commercial paper borrowings under this agreement are classified as long-term debt as they are intended to be refinanced on a long-term basis through continued commercial paper borrowings. Montana-Dakota's objective is to maintain acceptable credit ratings in order to access the capital markets through the issuance of commercial paper. Historically, downgrades in credit ratings have not limited, nor are currently expected to limit, Montana-Dakota's ability to access the capital markets. If Montana-Dakota were to experience a downgrade of its credit ratings in the future, it may need to borrow under its credit agreement and may experience an increase in overall interest rates with respect to its cost of borrowings. Prior to the maturity of the credit agreement, Montana-Dakota expects that it will negotiate the extension or replacement of this agreement. If Montana-Dakota is unable to successfully negotiate an extension of, or replacement for, the credit agreement, or if the fees on this facility become too expensive, which Montana-Dakota does not currently anticipate, it would seek alternative funding. On July 24, 2019, Montana-Dakota entered into a $200.0 million note purchase agreement with maturity dates ranging from October 17, 2039 to November 18, 2059, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.95 percent. Cascade On June 7, 2019, Cascade amended its revolving credit agreement to increase the borrowing limit to $100.0 million and extend the maturity date to June 7, 2024. Any borrowings under the revolving credit agreement are classified as long-term debt as they are intended to be refinanced on a long-term basis through continued borrowings. MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 49 Part II On June 13, 2019, Cascade issued $75.0 million of senior notes under a note purchase agreement with maturity dates ranging from June 13, 2029 to June 13, 2049, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.93 percent. Intermountain On June 7, 2019, Intermountain amended its revolving credit agreement to extend the maturity date to June 7, 2024. Any borrowings under the revolving credit agreement are classified as long-term debt as they are intended to be refinanced on a long-term basis through continued borrowings. On June 13, 2019, Intermountain issued $50.0 million of senior notes under a note purchase agreement with maturity dates ranging from June 13, 2029 to June 13, 2049, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.92 percent. Centennial On December 19, 2019, Centennial amended and restated its revolving credit agreement to increase the borrowing capacity to $600.0 million and extend the maturity date to December 19, 2024. Centennial's revolving credit agreement supports its commercial paper program. Commercial paper borrowings under this agreement are classified as long-term debt as they are intended to be refinanced on a long-term basis through continued commercial paper borrowings. Centennial's objective is to maintain acceptable credit ratings in order to access the capital markets through the issuance of commercial paper. Historically, downgrades in Centennial's credit ratings have not limited, nor are currently expected to limit, Centennial's ability to access the capital markets. If Centennial were to experience a downgrade of its credit ratings in the future, it may need to borrow under its credit agreement and may experience an increase in overall interest rates with respect to its cost of borrowings. Prior to the maturity of the Centennial credit agreement, Centennial expects that it will negotiate the extension or replacement of this agreement, which provides credit support to access the capital markets. In the event Centennial is unable to successfully negotiate this agreement, or in the event the fees on this facility become too expensive, which Centennial does not currently anticipate, it would seek alternative funding. On April 4, 2019, Centennial issued $150.0 million of senior notes under a note purchase agreement with maturity dates ranging from April 4, 2029 to April 4, 2034, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.60 percent. WBI Energy Transmission On July 26, 2019, WBI Energy Transmission amended its uncommitted note purchase and private shelf agreement to increase capacity to $300.0 million and extend the issuance period and expiration date to May 16, 2022. On December 16, 2019, WBI Energy Transmission issued $45.0 million of senior notes under the private shelf agreement with a maturity date of December 16, 2034, at an interest rate of 4.17 percent. WBI Energy Transmission had $170.0 million of notes outstanding at December 31, 2019 , which reduced the remaining capacity under this uncommitted private shelf agreement to $130.0 million . Dividend restrictions For information on the Company's dividends and dividend restrictions, see Item 8 - Note 12 . Off balance sheet arrangements As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined by the rules of the SEC. Contractual obligations and commercial commitments For more information on the Company's contractual obligations on long-term debt, operating leases and purchase commitments, see Item 8 - Notes 9 and 20 . At December 31, 2019 , the Company's commitments under these obligations were as follows: Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Total (In millions) Long-term debt maturities* $ 16.6 $ 149.5 $ 451.3 $ 1,632.8 $ 2,250.2 Estimated interest payments** .8 6.6 13.9 74.4 95.7 Operating leases 35.2 41.8 17.6 47.9 142.5 Purchase commitments 405.5 434.5 210.5 678.4 1,728.9 $ 458.1 $ 632.4 $ 693.3 $ 2,433.5 $ 4,217.3 * Unamortized debt issuance costs and discount are excluded from the table. ** Represents the estimated interest payments associated with the Company's long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 , assuming current interest rates and consistent amounts outstanding until their respective maturity dates over the periods indicated in the table above. At December 31, 2019 , the Company had total liabilities of $417.6 million related to asset retirement obligations that are excluded from the table above. Of the total asset retirement obligations, the current portion was $4.3 million at December 31, 2019 , and was included in 50 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II other accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remainder, which constitutes the long-term portion of asset retirement obligations, was included in deferred credits and other liabilities - other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Due to the nature of these obligations, the Company cannot determine precisely when the payments will be made to settle these obligations. For more information, see Item 8 - Note 10 . Not reflected in the previous table are $576,000 in uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2019 . The Company has no minimum funding requirements for its defined benefit pension plans for 2020 due to the additional contribution of $20.0 million in 2019. The Company's MEPP contributions are based on union employee payroll, which cannot be determined in advance for future periods. The Company may also be required to make additional contributions to its MEPPs as a result of their funded status. For more information, see Item 1A - Risk Factors and Item 8 - Note 17 . New Accounting Standards For information regarding new accounting standards, see Item 8 - Note 1 , which is incorporated herein by reference. Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates The Company has prepared its financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company's significant accounting policies are discussed in Item 8 - Note 1 . Estimates are used for items such as impairment testing of long-lived assets and goodwill; fair values of acquired assets and liabilities under the acquisition method of accounting; aggregate reserves; property depreciable lives; tax provisions; revenue recognized using the cost-to-cost measure of progress for contracts; uncollectible accounts; environmental and other loss contingencies; regulatory assets expected to be recovered in rates charged to customers; costs on construction contracts; unbilled revenues; actuarially determined benefit costs; asset retirement obligations; lease classification; present value of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities; and the valuation of stock-based compensation. The Company's critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties that affect the application of such policies. As discussed below, the Company's financial position or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates. The following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates. Impairment of long-lived assets and intangibles The Company reviews the carrying values of its long-lived assets and intangibles, excluding assets held for sale, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually for goodwill. Goodwill The Company performs its goodwill impairment testing annually in the fourth quarter. In addition, the test is performed on an interim basis whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or circumstances may include a significant adverse change in business climate, weakness in an industry in which the Company's reporting units operate or recent significant cash or operating losses with expectations that those losses will continue. The Company has determined that the reporting units for its goodwill impairment test are its operating segments, or components of an operating segment, that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results. For more information on the Company's operating segments, see Item 8 - Note 16 . Goodwill impairment, if any, is measured by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company must record an impairment loss for the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. For the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , there were no impairment losses recorded . At December 31, 2019 , the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value at all reporting units. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates which include assumptions about the Company's future revenue, profitability and cash flows, amount and timing of estimated capital expenditures, inflation rates, risk adjusted capital cost, operational plans, and current and future economic conditions, among others. The fair value of each reporting unit is MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 51 Part II determined using a weighted combination of income and market approaches. The Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology for its income approach. Under the income approach, the discounted cash flow model determines fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows over a specified period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period. Both values are discounted using a rate which reflects the best estimate of the risk adjusted capital cost at each reporting unit. Risk adjusted capital cost, which varies by reporting unit and was in the range of 4 percent to 9 percent, was utilized in the goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2019 . The goodwill impairment test also utilizes a long-term growth rate projection, which varies by reporting unit and was in the range of approximately 2 percent to 3 percent in the goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2019. Under the market approach, the Company estimates fair value using various multiples derived from enterprise value to EBITDA for comparative peer companies for each respective reporting unit. These multiples are applied to operating data for each reporting unit to arrive at an indication of fair value. In addition, the Company adds a reasonable control premium when calculating the fair value utilizing the peer multiples, which is estimated as the premium that would be received in a sale in an orderly transaction between market participants. The Company believes that the estimates and assumptions used in its impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information. Long-Lived Assets Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long-lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of the Company's assets and result in an impairment charge. If an impairment indicator exists for tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, the asset group held and used is tested for recoverability by comparing an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets compared to the carrying value of the assets. If impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. There is risk involved when determining the fair value of assets, tangible and intangible, as there may be unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions that have a material impact on the estimated amount and timing of future cash flows. In addition, the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in the valuation techniques used. The Company believes its estimates used in calculating the fair value of long-lived assets, including goodwill and identifiable intangibles, are reasonable based on the information that is known when the estimates are made. Business combinations The Company accounts for acquisitions on the Consolidated Financial Statements starting from the date of the acquisition, which is the date that control is obtained. The acquisition method of accounting requires acquired assets and liabilities assumed be recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The estimation of fair values of acquired assets and liabilities assumed by the Company requires significant judgment and requires various assumptions. Although independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, the appraised values may be based on significant estimates provided by management. The amounts and useful lives assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets compared to amounts assigned to goodwill, which is not amortized, can affect the results of operations in the period of and periods subsequent to a business combination. In determining fair values of acquired assets and liabilities assumed, the Company uses various observable inputs for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and various unobservable inputs, which includes the use of valuation models. Fair values are based on various factors including, but not limited to, age and condition of property, maintenance records, auction values for equipment with similar characteristics, recent sales and listings of comparable properties, data collected from drill holes and other subsurface investigations and geologic data. The Company primarily uses the market and cost approaches in determining the fair value of land and property, plant and equipment. A combination of the market and income approaches are used for aggregate reserves and intangibles, primarily a discounted cash flow model. There is a measurement period after the acquisition date during which the Company may adjust the amounts recognized for a business combination. Any such adjustments are recorded in the period the adjustment is determined with the corresponding offset to goodwill. These adjustments are typically based on obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The measurement period ends once the Company has obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date, but does not extend beyond one year from the date of the acquisition. Once the measurement period has ended, any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed are recorded in income from continuing operations. Regulatory accounting The Company is subject to rate regulation by state public service commissions and/or the FERC. The Company's regulated businesses account for certain income and expense items under the provisions of regulatory accounting, which require these businesses to defer as regulatory assets or liabilities certain items that would have otherwise been reflected as expense or income, respectively, based on the expected regulatory treatment in future rates. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred and 52 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II are expected to be recovered in rates charged to customers. Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for future costs. Management continually assesses the likelihood of recovery in future rates of incurred costs and refunds to customers associated with regulatory assets and liabilities. The expected recovery or flowback of these deferred items generally is based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each item. The Company believes that the accounting subject to rate regulation remains appropriate and its regulatory assets are probable of recovery in current rates or in future rate proceedings. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The recognition of revenue requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue. The accuracy of revenues reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements depends on, among other things, management's estimates of total costs to complete projects because the Company uses the cost-to-cost measure of progress on construction contracts for revenue recognition. To determine the proper revenue recognition method for contracts, the Company evaluates whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one single contract and whether the combined or single contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. This evaluation requires significant judgment and the decision to combine a group of contracts or separate the combined or single contract into multiple performance obligations could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. For most contracts, the customer contracts with the Company to provide a significant service of integrating a complex set of tasks and components into a single project. Hence, the Company's contracts are generally accounted for as one performance obligation. The Company recognizes construction contract revenue over time using an input method based on the cost-to-cost measure of progress for contracts because it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer which occurs as the Company incurs costs on the contract. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the costs incurred are compared with total estimated costs of a performance obligation. Revenues are recorded proportionately to the costs incurred. This method depends largely on the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates related to the extent of progress toward completion of the contract, contract revenues and contract costs. Inasmuch as contract prices are generally set before the work is performed, the estimates pertaining to every project could contain significant unknown risks such as volatile labor, material and fuel costs, weather delays, adverse project site conditions, unforeseen actions by regulatory agencies, performance by subcontractors, job management and relations with project owners. Changes in estimates could have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company's total construction contract revenue was $2.8 billion and $2.2 billion , respectively. Several factors are evaluated in determining the bid price for contract work. These include, but are not limited to, the complexities of the job, past history performing similar types of work, seasonal weather patterns, competition and market conditions, job site conditions, work force safety, reputation of the project owner, availability of labor, materials and fuel, project location and project completion dates. As a project commences, estimates are continually monitored and revised as information becomes available and actual costs and conditions surrounding the job become known. If a loss is anticipated on a contract, the loss is immediately recognized. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements. The Company considers contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Generally, contract modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration of services provided in the context of the contract and are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and the measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis. The Company's construction contracts generally contain variable consideration including liquidated damages, performance bonuses or incentives, claims, unapproved/unpriced change orders and penalties or index pricing. The variable amounts usually arise upon achievement of certain performance metrics or change in project scope. The Company estimates the amount of revenue to be recognized on variable consideration using estimation methods that best predict the most likely amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to or expects to incur. The Company includes variable consideration in the estimated transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Changes in circumstances could impact management's estimates made in determining the value of variable consideration recorded. The Company updates its estimate of the transaction price each reporting period and the effect of variable consideration on the transaction price is recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis. The Company believes its estimates surrounding the cost-to-cost method are reasonable based on the information that is known when the estimates are made. The Company has contract administration, accounting and management control systems in place that allow its MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 53 Part II estimates to be updated and monitored on a regular basis. Because of the many factors that are evaluated in determining bid prices, it is inherent that the Company's estimates have changed in the past and will continually change in the future as new information becomes available for each job. Pension and other postretirement benefits The Company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for certain eligible employees. Various actuarial assumptions are used in calculating the benefit expense (income) and liability (asset) related to these plans. Costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits bear the risk of change, as they are dependent upon numerous factors based on assumptions of future conditions. The Company makes various assumptions when determining plan costs, including the current discount rates and the expected long-term return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases, actuarially determined mortality data and health care cost trend rates. In selecting the expected long-term return on plan assets, which is considered to be one of the key variables in determining benefit expense or income, the Company considers historical returns, current market conditions, the mix of investments and expected future market trends, including changes in interest rates and equity and bond market performance. Another key variable in determining benefit expense or income is the discount rate. In selecting the discount rate, the Company matches forecasted future cash flows of the pension and postretirement plans to a yield curve which consists of a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds with varying maturity dates, as well as other factors, as a basis. The Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed-income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity and bond market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the future. Management estimates the rate of compensation increase based on long-term assumed wage increases and the health care cost trend rates are determined by historical and future trends. The Company estimates that a 50-basis point decrease in the discount rate or in the expected return on plan assets would each increase expense by approximately $1.7 million (after-tax) for the year ended December 31, 2019 . The Company believes the estimates made for its pension and other postretirement benefits are reasonable based on the information that is known when the estimates are made. These estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of variables and are expected to change in the future. Estimates and assumptions will be affected by changes in the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase and health care cost trend rates. The Company plans to continue to use its current methodologies to determine plan costs. For more information on the assumptions used in determining plan costs, see Item 8 - Note 17 . Income taxes The Company is required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and ongoing operations to estimate the Company's obligation to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, real estate, franchise and sales/use taxes. Judgments related to income taxes require the recognition in the Company's financial statements a tax position that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained on audit. Judgment and estimation is required in developing the provision for income taxes and the reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities and, if necessary, any valuation allowances. The interpretation of tax laws can involve uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret such laws differently. Actual income tax could vary from estimated amounts and may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income, cash flows, and tax-related assets and liabilities. In addition, the effective tax rate may be affected by other changes including the allocation of property, payroll and revenues between states. The Company assesses the deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration historical and anticipated earnings levels; the reversal of other existing temporary differences; available net operating losses and tax carryforwards; and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and amount of, a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. As facts and circumstances change, adjustment to the valuation allowance may be required. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Business Segment Financial and Operating Data includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as another financial measure, adjusted gross margin, that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as it relates to the Company's electric and natural gas distribution segments. The presentation of adjusted gross margin is intended to be a useful supplemental financial measure for investors understanding of the segments' operating performance. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, GAAP financial measures such as operating income (loss) or net income (loss). The Company's non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted gross margin, is not standardized; therefore, it may not be possible to compare this financial measure with other companies gross margin measures having the same or similar names. 54 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II In addition to operating revenues and operating expenses, management also uses the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted gross margin when evaluating the results of operations for the electric and natural gas distribution segments. Adjusted gross margin for the electric and natural gas distribution segments is calculated by adding back adjustments to operating income (loss). These add-back adjustments include: operation and maintenance expense; depreciation, depletion and amortization expense; and certain taxes, other than income. Adjusted gross margin includes operating revenues less the cost of electric fuel and purchased power, purchased natural gas sold and certain taxes, other than income. These taxes, other than income, included as a reduction to adjusted gross margin relate to revenue taxes. These segments pass on to their customers the increases and decreases in the wholesale cost of power purchases, natural gas and other fuel supply costs in accordance with regulatory requirements. As such, the segments' revenues are directly impacted by the fluctuations in such commodities. Revenue taxes, which are passed back to customers, fluctuate with revenues as they are calculated as a percentage of revenues. For these reasons, period over period, the segments' operating income (loss) is generally not impacted. The Company's management believes the adjusted gross margin is a useful supplemental financial measure as these items are included in both operating revenues and operating expenses. The Company's management also believes that adjusted gross margin and the remaining operating expenses that calculate operating income (loss) are useful in assessing the Company's utility performance as management has the ability to influence control over the remaining operating expenses. The following information reconciles operating income to adjusted gross margin for the electric segment. Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Operating income $ 64.0 $ 65.2 $ 79.9 Adjustments: Operating expenses: Operation and maintenance 125.7 123.0 122.2 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 58.7 51.0 47.7 Taxes, other than income 16.1 14.5 13.5 Total adjustments 200.5 188.5 183.4 Adjusted gross margin $ 264.5 $ 253.7 $ 263.3 The following information reconciles operating income to adjusted gross margin for the natural gas distribution segment. Years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Operating income $ 69.2 $ 72.3 $ 84.3 Adjustments: Operating expenses: Operation and maintenance 185.0 173.4 164.3 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 79.6 72.5 69.4 Taxes, other than income 23.5 21.7 20.5 Total adjustments 288.1 267.6 254.2 Adjusted gross margin $ 357.3 $ 339.9 $ 338.5 Effects of Inflation Inflation did not have a significant effect on the Company's operations in 2019 , 2018 or 2017 .
