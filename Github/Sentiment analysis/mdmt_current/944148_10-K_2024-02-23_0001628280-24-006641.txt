ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. This Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from management expectations. Please see the sections of this report entitled Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors. This section generally discusses the results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial conditions for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2023. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Financial Year in Review - Revenue of $1,591.2 million in 2023 grew $179.2 million, or 12.7%, from revenue of $1,412.0 million in 2022. Same-unit revenue, as defined below in the "Results of Operations" section, increased by $104.0 million, or 7.4%, while acquisitions, net of divestitures, contributed $75.2 million to revenue, or 5.3%. A detailed discussion of revenue by practice group is included under Operating Practice Groups. Net income in 2023 increased $15.6 million, or 14.8%, to $121.0 million from $105.4 million in 2022. Refer to Results of Operations for a detailed discussion of the components of net income. Earnings per diluted share were $2.39 in 2023, compared to $2.01 in 2022, with a fully diluted weighted average share count of 50.6 million shares in 2023, compared to 52.4 million shares in 2022. Strategic Use of Capital - Our first priority for the use of capital is to make strategic acquisitions. We completed the following five acquisitions in 2023: Effective January 1, 2023, we acquired all of the assets of Danenhauer and Danenhauer, Inc.("Danenhauer and Danenhauer"). Danenhauer and Danenhauer, based in California, is a provider of forensic accounting, business valuation, expert witness testimony, and other services for businesses and individuals. Operating results for Danenhauer and Danenhauer are reported in the Financial Services practice group. Effective February 1, 2023, we acquired the non-attest assets of Somerset CPAs and Advisors ("Somerset"). Somerset, based in Indianapolis, Indiana, is a provider of a full range of accounting, tax, and financial advisory services to clients in a wide array of industries. Operating results for Somerset are reported in the Financial Services practice group. Effective June 1, 2023, we acquired all of the assets of Pivot Point Security ("PPS"). PPS, based in Hamilton, New Jersey, is a provider of cyber and information security, and compliance services for small and middle market businesses. Operating results for PPS are reported in the Financial Services practice group. Effective June 1, 2023, we acquired all of the assets of Ickovic and Co. PC ("Ickovic and Co.").

Operating results for APA are reported in the Benefits and Insurance Services practice group. Refer to Note 18, Business Combinations, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion on acquisitions. We also have the financing flexibility and the capacity to actively repurchase shares of our common stock. We believe that repurchasing shares of our common stock is a prudent use of our financial resources, and that investing in our stock is an attractive use of capital and an efficient means to provide value to our stockholders. On February 7, 2024, the CBIZ Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 5.0 million shares of our common stock under our Share Repurchase Program (the Share Repurchase Program ), which may be suspended or discontinued at 21 any time and expires on March 31, 2025. The shares may be purchased (i) in the open market, (ii) in privately negotiated transactions, or (iii) under Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, which may include purchases from our employees, officers and directors, in accordance with SEC rules. CBIZ management will determine the timing and amount of the transaction based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Pursuant to previously authorized share repurchase programs, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock in the open market at a total cost of approximately $65.1 million in 2023 and 2.8 million shares at a total cost of approximately $122.8 million in 2022. Refer to Note 13, Common Stock, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the Share Repurchase Program. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We provide professional business services that help clients manage their finances and employees. We deliver our integrated services through the following three practice groups: Financial Services, Benefits and Insurance Services and National Practices. A description of these groups operating results and factors affecting their businesses is provided below. Same-unit revenue, also known internally as "Organic revenue", represents total revenue adjusted to reflect comparable periods of activity for acquisitions and divestitures. For example, for a business acquired on July 1, 2022, revenue for the period January 1, 2023 through June 30, 2023 would be reported as revenue from acquired businesses whereas revenue for the periods from July 1 through December 31 of both years would be reported as same-unit revenue. Divested operations represent operations that did not meet the criteria for treatment as discontinued operations. Revenue The following table summarizes total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Year Ended December 31, 2023 Percent 2022 Percent (Amounts in thousands, except percentages) Financial Services $ 1,160,686 72.9 % $ 1,010,068 71.5 % Benefits and Insurance Services 382,605 24.1 % 358,007 25.4 % National Practices 47,903 3.0 % 43,904 3.1 % Total CBIZ revenue $ 1,591,194 100.0 % $ 1,411,979 100.0 % A detailed discussion of same-unit revenue by practice group is included under Operating Practice Groups. Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan - We sponsor a non-qualified deferred compensation plan ("NQDCP"), under which a CBIZ employee compensation deferral is held in a rabbi trust and invested accordingly as directed by the employee. Income and expenses related to the deferred compensation plan are included in Operating expenses, Gross margin and Corporate General & Administrative expenses and are directly offset by deferred compensation gains or losses in Other income (expense), net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The deferred compensation plan has no impact on Income before income tax expense or diluted earnings per share. Income and expenses related to the deferred compensation plan for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 (Amounts in thousands) Operating expenses (income) $ 17,192 $ (17,252) Corporate general and administrative expenses (income) $ 2,296 $ (2,393) Other income (expense), net $ 19,488 $ (19,645) 22 Table of Contents Excluding the impact of the above-mentioned income and expenses related to the deferred compensation plan, the operating results for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 (Amounts in thousands, except percentages) As Reported NQDCP Adjusted % of Revenue As Reported NQDCP Adjusted % of Revenue Gross margin $ 223,204 $ 17,192 $ 240,396 15.1 % $ 223,367 $ (17,252) $ 206,115 14.6 % Operating income 165,239 19,488 184,727 11.6 % 168,344 (19,645) 148,699 10.5 % Other income (expense), net 21,019 (19,488) 1,531 0.1 % (19,243) 19,645 402 % Income before income tax expense 166,303 166,303 10.5 % 141,475 141,475 10.0 % Operating Expenses The following table presents our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 (Amounts in thousands, except percentages) Operating expenses $ 1,367,990 $ 1,188,612 Operating expenses % of revenue 86.0 % 84.2 % Operating expenses excluding deferred compensation $ 1,350,798 $ 1,205,864 Operating expenses excluding deferred compensation % of revenue 84.9 % 85.4 % Our operating expenses increased by $179.4 million. Operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 86.0% of revenue in 2023 as compared to 84.2% of revenue for the prior year. The non-qualified deferred compensation plan increased operating expenses by $17.2 million in 2023, but decreased operating expense by $17.3 million in 2022. Excluding the impact of the non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which was recorded in "Corporate and Other" for segment reporting purposes, operating expenses would have been $1,350.8 million, or 84.9% of revenue, in 2023 as compared to $1,205.9 million, or 85.4% of revenue, in 2022. The majority of our operating expenses relate to personnel costs, which includes (i) salaries and benefits, (ii) commissions paid to producers, (iii) incentive compensation and (iv) share-based compensation. Excluding the impact of non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which was recorded in "Corporate and Other" for segment reporting purposes, operating expenses increased by approximately $144.9 million in 2023 as compared to 2022. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 included approximately $1.9 million non-recurring integration and retention costs related to the Somerset acquisition, and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 included approximately $8.6 million non-recurring integration and retention costs related to the acquisition of the non-attest assets of Marks Paneth LLP ("Marks Paneth"). The increase in operating costs was driven by $121.6 million higher personnel cost (of which acquisitions contributed approximately $50.3 million), $9.0 million higher travel and entertainment costs, $3.4 million higher facility costs, $4.9 million higher computer and technology related costs, $3.4 million higher depreciation and amortization expense, as well as $1.7 million higher marketing expense. Other discretionary spending increased by approximately $0.9 million to support the growth in business activities. Personnel costs and other operating expenses are discussed in further detail under Operating Practice Groups. 23 Table of Contents Corporate General & Administrative Expenses The following table presents our Corporate General & Administrative ( G&A ) expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 (Amounts in thousands, except percentages) G&A expenses $ 57,965 $ 55,023 G&A expenses % of revenue 3.6 % 3.9 % G&A expenses excluding deferred compensation $ 55,669 $ 57,416 G&A expenses excluding deferred compensation % of revenue 3.5 % 4.1 % Our G&A expenses increased by approximately $2.9 million, or 5.3%, in 2023 as compared to 2022, and decreased to 3.6% of revenue from 3.9% of revenue for the prior year. The non-qualified deferred compensation plan increased G&A expenses by $2.3 million in 2023, and decreased G&A expenses by $2.4 million in 2022. Excluding the impact of the deferred compensation plan, which was recorded in "Corporate and Other" for segment reporting purposes, G&A expenses would have been $55.7 million, or 3.5% of revenue, in 2023 as compared to $57.4 million, or 4.1% of revenue, in 2022, a decrease of $1.7 million in 2023 as compared to prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by $2.4 million lower personnel costs, offset by $0.7 million higher legal and other professional related costs as compared to 2022. Personnel costs in 2022 included approximately $3.9 million cumulative adjustments to certain performance-based compensation programs, which did not recur in 2023. In addition, G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 included a $1.5 million non-recurring transaction and integration costs related to the Somerset acquisition.

The adjustments to the investments held in a rabbi trust related to the deferred compensation plan are offset by a corresponding increase or decrease to compensation expense, which is recorded as Operating expenses and G&A expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The deferred compensation plan has no impact on Income before income tax expense or diluted earnings per share. Interest Expense - Our primary financing arrangement is the 2022 credit facility. Interest expense was $20.1 million in 2023, compared to $8.0 million in 2022. Our average debt balance and weighted average interest rate was $364.1 million and 5.23%, respectively, in 2023, as compared to $267.0 million and 2.67%, respectively, in 2022. The increase in interest expense in 2023 as compared to 2022 was driven by a higher average debt balance as well as higher weighted average effective interest rate. Our debt is further discussed in Note 9, Debt and Financing Arrangements, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Gain on Sale of Operations, net - During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we recorded approximately $0.2 million additional gain related to a previously sold business as additional contingent proceeds were received. During the same period in 2022, we recorded approximately $0.4 million additional gain related to a previously sold business as additional contingent proceeds were received. Other Income (Expense), net - The majority of Other income (expense), net consists of net gains and losses associated with the value of the non-qualified deferred compensation plan as discussed above, net adjustments to the fair value of our contingent purchase price liability related to prior acquisitions, as well as gains or losses related 24 Table of Contents to the sale of assets. Other income of $21.0 million in 2023 included a $19.5 million net gain related to the deferred compensation plan, $2.8 million gain related to the sale of certain assets, $0.7 million interest income from non-operating investments, as well as $0.7 miscellaneous income, offset by $2.7 million expense due to the net increase to the fair value of the contingent purchase price liability. Other expense of $19.2 million in 2022 consisted of a net loss of $19.6 million related to the deferred compensation plan and $2.4 million expense due to the net increase to the fair value of the contingent purchase price liability, offset by a $2.4 million gain related to the sale of a book of business as well as $0.4 million other miscellaneous income. Income Tax Expense The following table presents our income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 (Amounts in thousands, except percentages) Income tax expense $ 45,335 $ 36,121 Effective tax rate 27.3 % 25.5 % The increase in income tax expense from 2022 to 2023 was primarily driven by higher pre-tax income. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to higher non-deductible expense in 2023 compared to 2022. In addition, the effect of higher pre-tax income on our tax benefit related to stock-based compensation also contributed to the increase in the effective tax rate. Operating Practice Groups We deliver our integrated services through three practice groups: Financial Services, Benefits and Insurance Services and National Practices. A description of these groups operating results and factors affecting their businesses is provided below. Financial Services Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 $ Change % Change (Amounts in thousands, except percentages) Revenue Same-unit $ 1,086,894 $ 1,010,068 $ 76,826 7.6 % Acquired businesses 73,792 73,792 Total revenue 1,160,686 1,010,068 150,618 14.9 % Operating expenses 975,076 850,038 125,038 14.7 % Gross margin / Operating income $ 185,610 $ 160,030 $ 25,580 16.0 % Total other income (expense), net $ 2,218 $ 682 $ 1,536 N/M Income before income tax expense $ 187,828 $ 160,712 $ 27,116 16.9 % Gross margin percentage 16.0 % 15.8 % The Financial Services practice group revenue in 2023 grew by 14.9% to $1,160.7 million from $1,010.1 million in 2022.

Operating expenses increased by $125.0 million in 2023 as compared to 2022, primarily as a result of $102.2 million, or 14.6%, in higher personnel costs, of which acquisitions contributed approximately $49.5 million to the increase primarily driven by the Somerset acquisition in 2023 and the wrap around effect of the Stinnett acquisition 25 Table of Contents in 2022. Compared to the same period in 2022, corporate allocated costs, travel and entertainment costs, depreciation and amortization costs, technology costs, direct costs, facility costs, and marketing costs increased by $6.2 million, $5.6 million, $3.4 million, $3.1 million, $2.3 million, $1.8 million, and $1.0 million, respectively, to support business growth.

Operating expense as a percentage of revenue remained relatively unchanged at 84.0% in 2023 and 84.2% in 2022.

Same-unit revenue increased by $23.2 million, or 6.5%, in 2023 when compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was across all service lines, particularly driven by an $11.1 million increase in employee benefit and retirement benefit services lines, $6.6 million increase in property and casualty services, $4.4 million in payroll related services, as well as a $1.1 million increase in other project-based services. Operating expenses increased by $20.1 million in 2023 as compared to 2022, primarily driven by $16.5 million, or 7.3%, higher personnel costs, attributable primarily to the amount of annual merit increases, bonus accruals, and investment in new sales producers. Compared to 2022, corporate allocated costs, travel and entertainment costs, technology costs, marketing costs, and direct costs increased by $2.2 million, $1.3 million, $0.5 million, $0.4 million, and $0.3 million, respectively. The increase in operating costs was offset by $1.0 million lower depreciation and amortization costs, $0.6 million lower facility costs, and $0.2 million lower bad debt expense. In addition, other miscellaneous discretionary costs increased by approximately $0.6 million, primarily driven by higher recruiting and other employee costs to support business growth.

The cost-plus contract is a five-year contract with the most recent renewal through 26 Table of Contents December 31, 2028. Revenues from this single client accounted for approximately 75% of the National Practice group revenue. Operating expenses have increased mainly due to increases in salaries and benefits costs. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other are operating expenses that are not directly allocated to the individual business units. These expenses primarily consist of certain health care costs, gains or losses attributable to assets held in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, stock-based compensation, consolidation and integration charges, certain professional fees, certain advertising costs and other various expenses.

Excluding the non-qualified deferred compensation expenses, operating expense decreased by approximately $4.1 million, primarily driven by $1.6 million lower personnel costs and $8.3 million higher allocation costs to other operating units. The decrease in operating costs was offset by $2.2 million higher facility costs, $1.3 million higher technology costs, $1.0 million higher depreciation costs, $0.5 million higher professional fees, as well as $0.8 million higher other miscellaneous discretionary costs to support business growth. Total G&A expenses increased by $2.9 million, or 5.3%, in 2023, as compared to 2022. The non-qualified deferred compensation plan increased G&A expenses by $2.3 million in 2023, but decreased G&A expenses by $2.4 million in 2022. Excluding the impact of the non-qualified deferred compensation plan, G&A expenses decreased by $1.7 million in 2023 as compared to the prior year, attributable to $2.4 million lower personnel costs, offset by $0.7 million higher legal and other professional related costs as compared to 2022.

The increase was driven by $12.1 million higher interest expense due to higher average debt balance as well as higher weighted average effective interest rate experienced in 2023 as compared to 2022, and $0.3 million higher other miscellaneous expenses. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table is derived from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 153,507 $ 126,132 Net cash used in investing activities (79,393) (99,118) Net cash used in financing activities (77,111) (17,343) 27 Table of Contents We generate strong cash flows from operations and have access to a $600.0 million credit facility, which enables us to fund investments and operating projects that are designed to optimize stockholder return. Cash flows from operations and available capital resources allow us to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase shares of our common stock when accretive to stockholders, meet working capital needs, and service our debt. Generally, we maintain low levels of cash and apply any available cash to pay down our outstanding debt balance. Due to the seasonal nature of the Financial Services practice group accounting and tax services in the first four months of the fiscal year, we historically generate much of our cash flows during the last three quarters of the fiscal year. Our working capital management primarily relates to trade accounts receivable, accounts payable, incentive-based compensation and other assets, which consists of other receivables and prepaid assets typically related to activities in the normal course of our business operations. At any specific point in time, working capital is subject to many variables, including seasonality and the timing of cash receipts and payments, most notably in the timing of insurance premiums to the carriers within our Benefits and Insurance practice group. We have restricted cash on deposit from clients in connection with the pass-through of insurance premiums to the carrier with the related liability for these funds recorded in Accounts payable in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounts receivable balances increase in response to the increase in revenue generated by the Financial Services practice group during the first four months of the year. A significant amount of this revenue is billed and collected in subsequent quarters. Days sales outstanding ( DSO ) represent accounts receivable and unbilled revenue (net of realization adjustments) at the end of the period, divided by trailing twelve months' daily revenue. DSO was 78 days as of December 31, 2023 and 74 days as of December 31, 2022. We provide DSO data because such data is commonly used as a performance measure by analysts and investors and as a measure of our ability to collect on receivables in a timely manner. Cash Provided by Operating Activities 2023 compared to 2022 - Cash provided by operating activities was $153.5 million during 2023, consisting of net income of $121.0 million and certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization expense of $36.3 million, share-based compensation expense of $12.3 million, deferred income tax of $11.3 million, bad debt expense of $1.6 million, and adjustment to the fair value of contingent purchase consideration of $2.7 million, offset by $29.0 million use of cash from working capital management. Cash provided by operating activities was $126.1 million during 2022, consisting of net income of $105.4 million and certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization expense of $32.9 million, share-based compensation expense of $14.7 million, deferred income tax of $13.9 million, bad debt expense of $1.2 million, adjustment to the fair value of contingent purchase consideration of $2.4 million, as well as $42.0 million of cash generated from working capital management. Investing Activities The majority of our investing activities relate to acquisitions, capital expenditures and net activity related to funds held for clients. Refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 18, Business Combinations, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our acquisitions and a further description of funds held for clients and client fund obligations. 2023 - Net cash used in investing activities in 2023 consisted primarily of $53.1 million cash paid for business acquisitions, $23.1 million in capital expenditures, and $10.3 million payments of working capital adjustments related to previously completed acquisitions, partially offset by $4.3 million net proceeds received from the sale of client funds investments, and $3.0 million proceeds received from the sale of certain assets. 2022 - Net cash used in investing activities in 2022 consisted of $79.1 million related to business acquisitions, $8.6 million in capital expenditures, $7.4 million net purchase of client funds, and $7.0 million payments of working capital adjustments related to previously completed acquisitions, offset by $3.0 million proceeds received from the sale of a book of business in the Benefit and Insurance practice group. Financing Activities The majority of our financing activities relate to our 2022 credit facility, share repurchases, net client fund obligation activity, as well as contingent consideration payments for prior acquisitions. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Financing 28 Table of Contents Arrangements, and Note 13, Common Stock, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our 2022 credit facility and Share Repurchase Program. 2023 - Net cash used in financing activities in 2023 consisted of $73.8 million of share repurchases, $45.2 million of contingent consideration payments for prior acquisitions, and a net decrease of $13.6 million in client fund obligations, partially offset by $8.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and $46.7 million net proceeds from borrowings under our 2022 credit facility. 2022 - Net cash used in financing activities in 2022 consisted of $129.8 million of share repurchases, $21.2 million of contingent consideration payments for prior acquisitions and $2.1 million paid as deferred financing costs related to the 2022 credit facility, partially offset by a net increase of $15.4 million in client fund obligations, $10.0 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and $110.4 million net proceeds from borrowings under our 2022 credit facility. CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table presents our capital structure (in thousands): December 31, 2023 2022 Bank debt $ 312,400 $ 265,700 Stockholders' equity 791,618 713,452 Total capital $ 1,104,018 $ 979,152 Credit Facility - Our primary financing arrangement is the $600.0 million unsecured credit facility, by and among CBIZ Operations, Inc., CBIZ, Inc. and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and bank, and other participating banks, which provides us with the capital necessary to meet our working capital needs as well as the flexibility to continue with our strategic initiatives, including business acquisitions and share repurchases, and matures in 2027. At December 31, 2023, we had $312.4 million outstanding under the credit facility, as well as letters of credit and license bonds totaling $5.8 million. Available funds under the credit facility, based on the terms of the commitment, were approximately $272.0 million at December 31, 2023. The weighted average interest rate under the credit facility was 5.23% in 2023 and 2.67% in 2022. The credit facility allows for the allocation of funds for future strategic initiatives, including acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Debt Covenant Compliance - We are required to meet certain financial covenants with respect to (i) total leverage ratio and (ii) interest coverage ratio. We were in compliance with our covenants as of December 31, 2023. Our ability to service our debt and to fund future strategic initiatives will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future. For further discussion regarding the 2022 credit facility, refer to Note 9, Debt and Financing Arrangements, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Use of Capital - Our first priority for the use of capital is to make strategic acquisitions. We completed five business acquisitions in 2023. Refer to Note 18, Business Combinations, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion on acquisitions. We also have the financing flexibility and the capacity to actively repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market. We believe that repurchasing shares of our common stock is a prudent use of our financial resources, and that investing in our stock is an attractive use of capital and an efficient means to provide value to our stockholders. We repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock in the open market at a total cost of approximately $65.1 million in 2023 and 2.8 million shares at a total cost of approximately $122.8 million in 2022. Refer to Note 13, Common Stock, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the Share Repurchase Program. Cash Requirements - Cash requirements for 2024 and beyond will generally include acquisitions, interest payments on debt, seasonal working capital requirements, contingent earnout payments for previous acquisitions, share repurchases, income tax payments, and capital expenditures. We believe that cash provided by operations, as well as available funds under the 2022 credit facility will be sufficient to meet cash requirements for the next 12 months and beyond. 29 Table of Contents OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements - We maintain ASAs with independent CPA firms (as described more fully under Business - Financial Services and in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), which qualify as variable interest entities. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect the operations or accounts of variable interest entities as the impact is not material to the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of CBIZ. We provide letters of credit for insurance needs as well as to landlords (lessors) of our leased premises in lieu of cash security deposits. Letters of credit totaled $3.5 million and $5.0 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, we provide license bonds to various state agencies to meet certain licensing requirements. The amount of license bonds outstanding was $2.3 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022. We have various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Generally, these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations, warranties, covenants or agreements, related to matters such as title to assets sold and certain tax matters. Payment by us under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned upon the other party making a claim. Such claims are typically subject to challenge by us and to dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or amount and, in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement. Historically, we have not made any payments under these agreements that have been material individually or in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2023, we were not aware of any obligations arising under indemnification agreements that would require material payments. Interest Rate Risk Management - We do not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We utilize interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk exposure associated with our floating-rate debt under the credit facility. Under these interest rate swap contracts, we receive cash flows from counterparties at variable rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ( SOFR ) and pay the counterparties a fixed rate. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, we only enter into contracts with selected major financial institutions with investment grade ratings and continually assess their creditworthiness. There are no credit risk-related contingent features in our interest rate swaps nor do the swaps contain provisions under which we would be required to post collateral. As of December 31, 2023, the notional value of all of our interest rate swaps was $150.0 million, with maturity dates ranging from April, 2025 to October, 2028. For further details on our interest rate swaps, refer to Note 6, Financial Instruments, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In connection with payroll services provided to clients, we collect funds from our clients accounts in advance of paying these client obligations. These funds held for clients are segregated and invested in accordance with our investment policy, which requires that all investments carry an investment grade rating at the time of initial investment. The interest income on these investments mitigates the interest rate risk for the borrowing costs of the 2022 credit facility, as the rates on both the investments and the outstanding borrowings against the credit facility are based on market conditions. Refer to Note 6, Financial Instruments, and Note 9, Debt and Financing Arrangements, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding investments and our debt and financing arrangements. 30 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such difference could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Significant accounting policies, including Revenue Recognition, are described more fully in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Accounts Receivable and Notes Receivable - We determine the net amount expected to be collected on our accounts receivable, both billed and unbilled, and notes receivable, based on a combination of factors, including but not limited to our historical incurred loss experience, credit-worthiness of our clients, the age of the receivable balance, current economic conditions that may affect a client's ability to pay, and current and projected economic trends and conditions at the balance sheet date. Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts for each accounting period. Material differences may result if facts and circumstances change in relation to the original estimation. Business Combinations - We recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date at fair value. Fair value measurements require extensive use of estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets. In addition, we recognize and measure contingent consideration at fair value as of the acquisition date using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model. The fair value of contingent consideration obligations that are classified as liabilities are reassessed each reporting period. Any change in the fair value estimate is recorded in the earnings of that period. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets - Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of the acquired business and the related fair value of the net assets acquired. A significant portion of our assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets is goodwill. At December 31, 2023, the carrying value of goodwill totaled $865.2 million, compared to total assets of $2.0 billion and total stockholders equity of $791.6 million. Intangible assets consist of identifiable intangibles other than goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill include client lists and non-compete agreements, which require significant judgments in determining the fair value. We carry client lists and non-compete agreements at cost, less accumulated amortization, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter. In addition to our annual goodwill test, on a periodic basis, we are required to consider whether it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value has fallen below its carrying value, thus requiring us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test. Intangible assets with definite lives, such as client lists and non-compete agreements, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives (generally ranging from two to fifteen years). We review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset. If impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis or market comparable method. The goodwill impairment test is performed at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment of a business or one level below an operating segment. At December 31, 2023, we had five reporting units. We may use either a qualitative or quantitative approach when testing a reporting unit goodwill for impairment. Under the qualitative assessment, we are not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. If under the quantitative assessment the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the amount of the impairment loss, if any, must be measured. Any such impairment charge would reduce earnings and could be material. After considering changes to assumptions used in our most recent quantitative testing for each reporting unit, including the capital market environment, economic and market conditions, industry competition and trends, our weighted average cost of capital, changes in management and key personnel, the price of our common stock, changes in our results of operations, the magnitude of the excess of fair value over the carrying amount of each reporting unit as determined in our most recent quantitative testing, and other factors, we concluded that it was 31 Table of Contents more likely than not that the fair values of each of our reporting units were more than their respective carrying values and, therefore, did not perform a quantitative impairment analysis. For further information regarding our goodwill balances, refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Loss Contingencies - Loss contingencies, including litigation claims, are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods. Estimating probable losses requires analysis that often depends on judgment about potential actions by third parties. Refer to Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. Other Significant Policies - Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of management judgment and uncertainty as those discussed above, are also critical in understanding the consolidated financial statements. Those policies are described in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements - Refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
