Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. For discussion of our consolidated and segment-level results of operations, non-GAAP measures, and liquidity and capital resources for fiscal year 2017, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2019. Overview We are one of the largest casual dining restaurant companies in the world with a portfolio of leading, differentiated restaurant concepts. As of December 29, 2019 , we owned and operated 1,173 restaurants and franchised 300 restaurants across 48 states, Puerto Rico, Guam and 21 countries. We have four founder-inspired concepts: Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and Fleming Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar. Executive Summary Our 2019 financial results include: An increase in Total revenues of 0.3% to $4.1 billion in 2019 as compared to 2018 , driven primarily by higher comparable restaurant sales and the net impact of restaurant openings and closures. These increases were partially offset by the effect of foreign currency translation and domestic refranchising. Income from operations increased to $191.1 million in 2019 as compared to $145.3 million in 2018 , primarily due to higher comparable restaurant sales, the impact of certain cost savings initiatives and lower impairment charges and restaurant closing costs. These increases were partially offset by labor, commodity and operating expense inflation, delivery rollout costs and the impact of deferred gain amortization no longer recognized upon adoption of the new lease standard. Following is a summary of factors that impacted our operating results and liquidity in 2019 and significant actions we have taken during the year: Refranchising - During 2019, we completed the sale of 18 of our U.S. Company-owned Carrabba Italian Grill restaurants to an existing franchisee for cash proceeds of $3.6 million , net of certain purchase price adjustments. See Note 4 - Disposals of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Surplus Property Disposals - During 2019, we completed the sale of five of our U.S. surplus properties to a franchisee for cash proceeds of $12.7 million , net of certain purchase price adjustments. The transaction resulted in a net gain of $3.6 million , recorded within Other restaurant operating expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income . Share Repurchase Programs and Dividends - We repurchased 5.5 million shares of common stock during 2019 for a total of $107.0 million and paid $35.7 million of dividends. 31 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued Business Strategies In 2020 , our key business strategies include: Enhance the 360-Degree Customer Experience to Drive Sustainable Healthy Sales Growth. We plan to continue to make investments to enhance our core guest experience, increase off-premises dining occasions, remodel and relocate restaurants, invest in digital marketing and data personalization and utilize the Dine Rewards loyalty program and multimedia marketing campaigns to drive sales. Drive Long-Term Shareholder Value. We plan to drive long-term shareholder value by reinvesting operational cash flow into our business, improving our credit profile and returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Enrich Engagement Among Stakeholders. We take the responsibility to our people, customers and communities seriously and continue to invest in programs that support the well-being of those engaged with us. Maximize International Opportunity. We continue to focus on existing geographic regions in South America, with strategic expansion in Brazil, and pursue global franchise opportunities. We intend to fund our business strategies, drive revenue growth and margin improvement, in part by reinvesting savings generated by anticipated cost savings discussed below and productivity initiatives across our businesses. Strategic Alternatives Review Update In November 2019, we announced that we are exploring and evaluating strategic alternatives that have the potential to maximize value for our shareholders, including but not limited to, a possible sale of the Company. Since then, management has been actively working with the Board of Directors and its financial and legal advisors to review all aspects of the business and available opportunities. Concurrently, we have built a plan that supports a growth-focused, operations centric organization. The pillars of this plan are as follows: Aligned leadership, resources and structure to prioritize growth, efficiency and scale. Simplified our corporate support functions to enable a more agile and operations-focused organization. Rebalanced capital allocation policy, including doubling our dividend, while maintaining flexibility to pay down debt, repurchase shares and reinvest back in our business. We are confident that these actions, coupled with our ongoing focus on driving sustainable healthy sales growth in our restaurants, will increase total shareholder return in 2020 and beyond. 32 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued Key Performance Indicators Key measures that we use in evaluating our restaurants and assessing our business include the following: Average restaurant unit volumes average sales (excluding gift card breakage) per restaurant to measure changes in consumer traffic, pricing and development of the brand; Comparable restaurant sales year-over-year comparison of sales volumes (excluding gift card breakage) for Company-owned restaurants that are open 18 months or more in order to remove the impact of new restaurant openings in comparing the operations of existing restaurants; System-wide sales total restaurant sales volume for all Company-owned and franchise restaurants, regardless of ownership, to interpret the overall health of our brands; Restaurant-level operating margin, Income from operations, Net income and Diluted earnings per share financial measures utilized to evaluate our operating performance. Restaurant-level operating margin is widely regarded in the industry as a useful metric to evaluate restaurant level operating efficiency and performance of ongoing restaurant-level operations, and we use it for these purposes, overall and particularly within our two segments. Our restaurant-level operating margin is expressed as the percentage of our Restaurant sales that Cost of sales, Labor and other related and Other restaurant operating expense (including advertising expenses) represent, in each case as such items are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following categories of our revenue and operating expenses are not included in restaurant-level operating margin because we do not consider them reflective of operating performance at the restaurant-level within a period: (i) Franchise and other revenues which are earned primarily from franchise royalties and other non-food and beverage revenue streams, such as rental and sublease income. (ii) Depreciation and amortization which, although substantially all is related to restaurant-level assets, represent historical sunk costs rather than cash outlays for the restaurants. (iii) General and administrative expense which includes primarily non-restaurant-level costs associated with support of the restaurants and other activities at our corporate offices. (iv) Asset impairment charges and restaurant closing costs which are not reflective of ongoing restaurant performance in a period. Restaurant-level operating margin excludes various expenses, as discussed above, that are essential to support the operations of our restaurants and may materially impact our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income . As a result, restaurant-level operating margin is not indicative of our consolidated results of operations and is presented exclusively as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, net income or income from operations. In addition, our presentation of restaurant operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry; Adjusted restaurant-level operating margin, Adjusted income from operations, Adjusted net income, Adjusted diluted earnings per share non-GAAP financial measures utilized to evaluate our operating performance, which definitions, usefulness and reconciliations are described in more detail in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below; and Consumer satisfaction scores measurement of our consumers experiences in a variety of key areas. 33 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC.

In 2020 , we expect commodity costs to increase approximately 2% . Labor and other related expenses FISCAL YEAR (dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Change Labor and other related $ 1,207.3 $ 1,197.3 % of Restaurant sales 29.6 % 29.5 % 0.1 % Labor and other related expenses include all direct and indirect labor costs incurred in operations, including distribution expense to Restaurant Managing Partners, costs related to field deferred compensation plans and other field incentive compensation expenses. Labor and other related expenses increased as a percentage of Restaurant sales in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to 0.6% from wage rate increases, offset by decreases as a percentage of Restaurant sales of 0.4% from increases in average check per person and 0.2% from the impact of certain cost savings initiatives. In 2020 , we anticipate approximately 3.5% labor cost inflation. Other restaurant operating expenses FISCAL YEAR (dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Change Other restaurant operating $ 982.1 $ 967.1 % of Restaurant sales 24.1 % 23.8 % 0.3 % Other restaurant operating expenses include certain unit-level operating costs such as operating supplies, rent, repairs and maintenance, advertising expenses, utilities, pre-opening costs and other occupancy costs.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued Restaurant sales in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to: (i) 0.5% from additional expense related to the rollout of delivery services, (ii) 0.4% from operating expense inflation and (iii) 0.3% from the impact of deferred gains on sale-leaseback transactions no longer recognized in 2019 as a result of adoption of the new lease accounting standard. These increases were partially offset by decreases as a percentage of Restaurant sales of 0.5% from the impact of certain cost savings initiatives and 0.3% from increases in average check per person. Depreciation and amortization FISCAL YEAR (dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Change Depreciation and amortization $ 196.8 $ 201.6 $ (4.8 ) Depreciation and amortization decreased in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to: (i) disposal of assets related to the sale-leaseback of certain properties, (ii) store closures and domestic refranchising and (iii) the effect of foreign currency translation. These decreases were partially offset by additional depreciation expense related to restaurant openings, relocations and remodels. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expense includes salaries and benefits, management incentive programs, related payroll tax and benefits, other employee-related costs and professional services. Following is a summary of the changes in General and administrative expense for the period indicated: FISCAL YEAR (dollars in millions) 2019 For fiscal year 2018 $ 282.7 Change from: Incentive compensation (4.2 ) Foreign currency exchange (2.5 ) Legal and professional fees (2.9 ) Severance 1.8 Other 0.3 For fiscal year 2019 $ 275.2 Provision for impaired assets and restaurant closings FISCAL YEAR (dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Change Provision for impaired assets and restaurant closings $ 9.1 $ 36.9 $ (27.8 ) International Restructuring - We recognized asset impairment and closure charges of $2.0 million and $13.9 million during 2019 and 2018 , respectively, related to restructuring of certain international markets, including Puerto Rico and China, within the international segment. Express Concept Restructuring - In 2018, we recognized asset impairment charges of $7.4 million related to the restructuring of our Express concept, within the U.S. segment. As a part of the restructuring, three Express locations closed during 2019. 39 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued Refranchising - During 2019, we completed the sale of 18 of our U.S. Company-owned Carrabba Italian Grill restaurants to an existing franchisee. In connection with the sale of these restaurants, we recognized asset impairment charges of $5.5 million in 2018, within the U.S. segment. The remaining impairment and closing charges for the periods presented primarily resulted from approved store closure initiatives, locations identified for remodel, relocation or closure and certain other assets. We continue to pursue refranchising opportunities in select markets as we look to further optimize our restaurant portfolio. As a result of these transactions, we may record future net gains or losses, impairment charges and transaction related expenses. Income from operations FISCAL YEAR (dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Change Income from operations $ 191.1 $ 145.3 % of Total revenues 4.6 % 3.5 % 1.1 % The increase in Income from operations during 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to: (i) higher comparable restaurant sales, (ii) the impact of certain cost saving initiatives and (iii) lower impairment charges and restaurant closing costs. These increases were partially offset by: (i) labor, commodity and operating expense inflation, (ii) additional expense related to the rollout of delivery services and (iii) the impact of deferred gain amortization no longer recognized upon adoption of the new lease standard. Interest expense, net FISCAL YEAR (dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Change Interest expense, net $ 49.3 $ 44.9 $ 4.4 The increase in Interest expense, net during 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to a higher fixed rate on the notional amount of our derivative instruments and higher average interest rates and borrowings outstanding, partially offset from the derecognition of certain lease-related debt obligations due to adoption of the new lease accounting standard. Provision (benefit) for income taxes FISCAL YEAR 2019 2018 Change Effective income tax rate 5.3 % (9.2 )% 14.5 % The net increase in the effective income tax rate in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to employment-related credits being a lower percentage of net income in 2019 , excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation arrangements recorded in 2018 and an increase in the foreign tax rate differential in 2019 . These increases were partially offset by a decrease in valuation allowances recorded against deferred income tax assets in 2019 . The effective income tax rate for 2019 was lower than the blended federal and state statutory rate of approximately 26%, primarily due to the benefit of tax credits for FICA taxes on certain employees tips. The effective income tax rate for 2018 was lower than the blended federal and state statutory rate of approximately 26%, primarily due to the benefit of tax credits for FICA taxes on certain employees tips and excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation arrangements. 40 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued Segments We consider our restaurant concepts and international markets as operating segments, which reflects how we manage our business, review operating performance and allocate resources. Resources are allocated and performance is assessed by our Chief Executive Officer, whom we have determined to be our Chief Operating Decision Maker. We aggregate our operating segments into two reportable segments, U.S. and international. The U.S. segment includes all restaurants operating in the U.S. while restaurants operating outside the U.S. are included in the international segment. Revenues for both segments include only transactions with customers and excludes intersegment revenues. Excluded from Income from operations for U.S. and international are certain legal and corporate costs not directly related to the performance of the segments, most stock-based compensation expenses and certain bonus expenses. Refer to Note 21 - Segment Reporting of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of segment income from operations to the consolidated operating results.

U.S. Restaurant sales in 2019 were flat as compared to 2018 primarily due to higher comparable restaurant sales and sales from 12 new restaurants not included in our comparable restaurant sales base, offset by domestic refranchising and the closing of 22 restaurants since December 31, 2017 . 41 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued Income from operations The increase in U.S. Income from operations generated in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to: (i) higher comparable restaurant sales, (ii) the impact of certain cost savings initiatives and (iii) lower impairment charges and restaurant closing costs. These increases were partially offset by: (i) labor, commodity and operating expense inflation, (ii) additional expense related to the rollout of delivery services and (iii) the impact of deferred gain amortization no longer recognized upon adoption of the new lease standard.

The increase in international Restaurant sales was partially offset by the effect of foreign currency translation of the Brazilian Real relative to the U.S. dollar and the closing of 18 restaurants since December 31, 2017 . Income from operations The increase in international Income from operations in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to: (i) lower impairment and restaurant closing costs, (ii) the impact of certain cost savings initiatives, (iii) higher comparable restaurant sales, (iv) improved operating performance by our Abbraccio concept and (v) lower General and administrative expense, primarily from lower severance costs. These increases were partially offset by labor, operating and commodity expense inflation. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP measures, which present operating results on an adjusted basis. These are supplemental measures of performance that are not required 42 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued by or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the following: (i) system-wide sales, (ii) Adjusted restaurant-level operating margins, (iii) Adjusted income from operations and the corresponding margins, (iv) Adjusted net income and (v) Adjusted diluted earnings per share. We believe that our use of non-GAAP financial measures permits investors to assess the operating performance of our business relative to our performance based on U.S. GAAP results and relative to other companies within the restaurant industry by isolating the effects of certain items that may vary from period to period without correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. However, our inclusion of these adjusted measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items or that the items for which we have made adjustments are unusual or infrequent or will not recur. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors as they form part of the basis for how our management team and Board of Directors evaluate our operating performance, allocate resources and establish employee incentive plans. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace U.S. GAAP financial measures, and they are not necessarily standardized or comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. We maintain internal guidelines with respect to the types of adjustments we include in our non-GAAP measures. These guidelines endeavor to differentiate between types of gains and expenses that are reflective of our core operations in a period, and those that may vary from period to period without correlation to our core performance in that period. However, implementation of these guidelines necessarily involves the application of judgment, and the treatment of any items not directly addressed by, or changes to, our guidelines will be considered by our disclosure committee. Refer to the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures for descriptions of the actual adjustments made in the current period and the corresponding prior period. System-Wide Sales - System-wide sales is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes sales of all restaurants operating under our brand names, whether we own them or not. Management uses this information to make decisions about future plans for the development of additional restaurants and new concepts, as well as evaluation of current operations. System-wide sales comprise sales of Company-owned and franchised restaurants. For a summary of sales of Company-owned restaurants, refer to Note 3 - Revenue Recognition of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table provides a summary of sales of franchised restaurants, which are not included in our consolidated financial results. Franchise sales within this table do not represent our sales and are presented only as an indicator of changes in the restaurant system, which management believes is important information regarding the health of our restaurant concepts and in determining our royalties and/or service fees.

Liquidity and Capital Resources LIQUIDITY Our liquidity sources consist of cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our credit facilities. We expect to use cash primarily for general operating expenses, lease payments, share repurchases and dividend payments, payments on our debt, remodeling or relocating older restaurants, obligations related to our deferred compensation plans and investments in technology. We believe that our expected liquidity sources are adequate to fund debt service requirements, lease obligations, capital expenditures and working capital obligations during the 12 months following this filing and beyond. However, our 45 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued ability to continue to meet these requirements and obligations will depend on, among other things, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue and cash flow and our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully. Cash and Cash Equivalents - As of December 29, 2019 , we had $67.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $21.1 million was held by foreign affiliates. The international jurisdictions in which we have significant cash do not have any known restrictions that would prohibit repatriation. As of December 29, 2019 , we had aggregate accumulated foreign earnings of approximately $84.4 million . This amount primarily consists of historical earnings from 2017 and prior that were previously taxed in the U.S. under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and post-2017 foreign earnings, which we may repatriate to the U.S. without additional material U.S. federal income taxes. These amounts are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. See Note 19 - Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our indefinite reinvestment assertion. Closure Initiatives - Total aggregate future undiscounted cash expenditures of $11.3 million to $13.8 million related to lease liabilities for certain closure initiatives are expected to occur over the remaining lease terms with the final term ending in January 2029 . Capital Expenditures - We estimate that our capital expenditures will total approximately $175 million to $190 million in 2020 . The amount of actual capital expenditures may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things, including restrictions imposed by our borrowing arrangements. Credit Facilities - As of December 29, 2019 , we had $1.0 billion of outstanding borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. We continue to evaluate whether we will make further payments of our outstanding debt ahead of scheduled maturities. See Note 13 - Long-term Debt, Net of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Following is a summary of our outstanding credit facilities as of the dates indicated and principal payments and debt issuance during the periods indicated: SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY TOTAL CREDIT FACILITIES TERM LOAN A REVOLVING FACILITY (dollars in thousands) Balance as of December 31, 2017 $ 500,000 $ 600,000 $ 1,100,000 2018 new debt 478,000 478,000 2018 payments (25,000 ) (478,500 ) (503,500 ) Balance as of December 30, 2018 475,000 599,500 1,074,500 2019 new debt 670,800 670,800 2019 payments (25,000 ) (671,300 ) (696,300 ) Balance as of December 29, 2019 (1) $ 450,000 $ 599,000 $ 1,049,000 Weighted-average interest rate, as of December 29, 2019 3.40 % 3.44 % Principal maturity date November 2022 November 2022 ________________ (1) Subsequent to December 29, 2019 , we made payments of $65.0 million , net of borrowings, on our revolving credit facility. Credit Agreement - On November 30, 2017 , we and OSI, as co-borrowers, entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with a syndicate of institutional lenders, providing for senior secured financing of up to $1.5 billion , consisting of a $500.0 million Term loan A and a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (the Senior Secured Credit Facility ), including letter of credit and swing line loan sub-facilities. As of December 29, 2019 , we had $380.8 million in available unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, net of letters of credit of $20.2 million . 46 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued Our Credit Agreement contains mandatory prepayment requirements of 50% of our annual excess cash flow, as defined in the Credit Agreement . The amount outstanding required to be prepaid may vary based on our leverage ratio and year end results. Other than the required minimum amortization premiums of $25.0 million , we do not anticipate any other payments will be required through December 27, 2020. Debt Covenants - Our Credit Agreement contains various financial and non-financial covenants. A violation of these covenants could negatively impact our liquidity by restricting our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility and cause an acceleration of the amounts due under the credit facilities. See Note 13 - Long-term Debt, Net of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 , we were in compliance with our debt covenants. We believe that we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants during the next 12 months and beyond. Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk - We have variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements with 12 counterparties to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate debt. The swap agreements have an aggregate notional amount of $550.0 million and mature on November 30, 2022 . We pay a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.04% on the notional amount and receive payments from the counterparties based on the one-month LIBOR rate. See Note 16 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. SUMMARY OF CASH FLOWS The following table presents a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: FISCAL YEAR (dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 317,603 $ 288,074 Net cash used in investing activities (131,291 ) (177,296 ) Net cash used in financing activities (189,359 ) (164,352 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (1,631 ) (4,146 ) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (4,678 ) $ (57,720 ) Operating activities - Net cash provided by operating activities increased during 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to: (i) the timing of collections of receivables, (ii) the timing of payments and (iii) lower purchases of inventory. Net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by higher income tax and interest payments. Investing activities - Net cash used in investing activities during 2019 primarily consisted of capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of property, fixtures and equipment and proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions. Net cash used in investing activities during 2018 primarily consisted of capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions and proceeds from the disposal of property, fixtures and equipment. Financing activities - Net cash used in financing activities during 2019 primarily consisted of the following: (i) the repurchase of common stock, (ii) payment of cash dividends on our common stock, (iii) the net repayment of long-term debt and (iv) partner equity plan payments. Net cash used in financing activities during 2018 primarily consisted of the following: (i) the repurchase of common stock, (ii) payment of cash dividends on our common stock, (iii) the net repayment of long-term debt and (iv) partner 47 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued equity plan payments. Net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by net proceeds from share-based compensation. FINANCIAL CONDITION Following is a summary of our current assets, current liabilities and working capital (deficit) as of the periods indicated: (dollars in thousands) DECEMBER 29, 2019 DECEMBER 30, 2018 Current assets $ 340,468 $ 335,483 Current liabilities 962,021 791,039 Working capital (deficit) (1) $ (621,553 ) $ (455,556 ) _________________ (1) During fiscal year 2019, net working capital (deficit) was negatively impacted by the recognition of approximately $170 million of current lease liabilities as a result of the adoption of the new lease accounting standard. Working capital (deficit) includes: (i) Unearned revenue primarily from unredeemed gift cards of $369.3 million and $342.7 million as of December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 , respectively and (ii) current operating lease liabilities of $171.9 million as of December 29, 2019 , with the corresponding operating right-of-use assets recorded as non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We have, and in the future may continue to have, negative working capital balances (as is common for many restaurant companies). We operate successfully with negative working capital because cash collected on restaurant sales is typically received before payment is due on our current liabilities, and our inventory turnover rates require relatively low investment in inventories. Additionally, ongoing cash flows from restaurant operations and gift card sales are used to service debt obligations and make capital expenditures. Deferred Compensation Programs - Certain Restaurant Managing Partners and Chef Partners in the U.S. ( U.S. Partners ) participate in deferred compensation programs that are subject to the rules of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The deferred compensation obligation due under these plans was $49.0 million and $69.6 million as of December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 , respectively. We invest in various corporate-owned life insurance policies, which are held within an irrevocable grantor or rabbi trust account for settlement of our obligations under these deferred compensation plans. The rabbi trust is funded through our voluntary contributions. The unfunded obligation was $9.1 million and $26.3 million as of December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 , respectively. We use working capital to fund the deferred compensation plans and currently expect annual cash funding of $9.0 million to $11.0 million in 2020. Actual funding of the deferred compensation obligations and future funding requirements may vary significantly depending on the actual performance compared to targets, timing of deferred payments of partner contracts, forfeiture rates, number of partner participants, growth of partner investments and our funding strategy. Other Compensation Programs - Certain U.S. Partners participate in a non-qualified long-term compensation program that we fund as the obligation for each participant becomes due. DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES Dividends - In 2019 and 2018 , we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 and $0.09 per share, respectively. In February 2020, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, payable on March 13, 2020 . Future dividend payments are dependent on our earnings, financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, surplus and other factors that our Board considers relevant. 48 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC.

Our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases is dependent on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, have access to our revolving credit facility and the existence of surplus. Based on our Credit Agreement, restricted dividend payments can be made on an unlimited basis provided we are compliant with our debt covenants. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS None. 49 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued OTHER MATERIAL COMMITMENTS Our operating lease obligations, debt obligations, contractual obligations and commitments as of December 29, 2019 are summarized in the following table: PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD LESS THAN 1-3 3-5 MORE THAN (dollars in thousands) TOTAL 1 YEAR YEARS YEARS 5 YEARS Recorded Contractual Obligations Operating leases (1) $ 2,643,642 $ 179,168 $ 381,854 $ 364,911 $ 1,717,709 Long-term debt (2) 1,048,891 26,462 1,022,429 Deferred compensation and other partner obligations (3) 70,270 22,440 30,201 9,466 8,163 Other recorded contractual obligations (4) 23,640 4,559 4,267 1,963 12,851 Unrecorded Contractual Obligations Interest (5) 128,150 44,764 83,386 Purchase obligations (6) 312,033 217,668 55,858 35,540 2,967 Total contractual obligations $ 4,226,626 $ 495,061 $ 1,577,995 $ 411,880 $ 1,741,690 ____________________ (1) Amounts represent undiscounted future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. Includes $1.0 billion related to lease renewal options that are reasonably certain of exercise. (2) Includes finance lease obligations. Amount is net of unamortized debt issuance costs and discount of $2.7 million . (3) Includes deferred compensation obligations, deposits and other accrued obligations due to our restaurant partners. Timing and amounts of payments may vary significantly based on employee turnover, return of deposits and changes to buyout values. (4) Includes other long-term liabilities, primarily consisting of non-partner deferred compensation obligations. Unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from this table since it is not possible to estimate when these future payments will occur. (5) Projected future interest payments on long-term debt are based on interest rates in effect as of December 29, 2019 and assume only scheduled principal payments. Estimated interest expense includes the impact of our variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements. (6) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. We have purchase obligations with various vendors that consist primarily of inventory, advertising, restaurant-level service contracts and technology. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these accompanying consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made and changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets - Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. For long-lived assets deployed at our restaurants, we review for impairment at the individual restaurant level. When evaluating for impairment, the total future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets are compared to the carrying amount. If the total future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount, this may be an indicator of impairment. An impairment loss is recognized in earnings 50 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued when the asset carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair value is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow model. The key estimates and assumptions used in this model are future cash flow estimates, with material changes generally driven by changes in expected use, and the discount rate. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets - Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the second fiscal quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. In considering the qualitative approach, we evaluate factors including, but not limited to, macro-economic conditions, market and industry conditions, commodity cost fluctuations, competitive environment, share price performance, results of prior impairment tests, operational stability and the overall financial performance of the reporting units. If the qualitative assessment is not performed or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated. Fair value of a reporting unit is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is estimated by utilizing a weighted average of the income approach, using a discounted cash flow model, and the market approach including the guideline public company method and guideline transaction method. The key estimates and assumptions used in these models are future cash flow estimates, which are heavily influenced by revenue growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures. The fair value of the trade name is determined through a relief from royalty method. The carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to its estimated fair value, with any excess of carrying value over fair value deemed to be an indicator of impairment. The carrying value of goodwill as of December 29, 2019 was $288.4 million , which related to our U.S. and international reporting units. We performed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of 2019 by utilizing the qualitative approach and determined that there were no events or circumstances to indicate that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units was less than their carrying values. Sales declines at our restaurants, unplanned increases in commodity or labor costs, deterioration in overall economic conditions and challenges in the restaurant industry may result in future impairment charges. It is possible that changes in circumstances or changes in our judgments, assumptions and estimates could result in an impairment charge of a portion or all of our goodwill or other intangible assets. Leases - On December 31, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-02: Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU No. 2016-02 ) and its applicable amendments (the new lease standard ), as described in detail within Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon adoption, we recognized right-of-use assets of $1.3 billion and corresponding lease liabilities of $1.5 billion. We use judgment to determine the reasonably certain lease term, which in turn, impacts the applicable incremental borrowing rate ( IBR ) used to calculate the initial lease liability for each portfolio of leases. We determined the present value of the lease liabilities by using a country specific IBR and applying a single rate to the respective portfolio of leases based on term, regardless of the underlying asset type. The reasonably certain lease term used in the evaluation of existing leases at transition and new leases after adoption of the new lease standard includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option is reasonably certain because failure to exercise such an option would result in an economic penalty. Such an economic penalty would typically result from having to abandon a building or equipment with remaining economic value upon vacating a property. 51 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued We use our estimated IBR, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of lease payments. We give consideration to market data as well as publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our IBR. At the inception of each lease, we evaluate the property and the lease to determine whether the lease is an operating lease or a financing lease. This lease accounting evaluation may require significant judgment in determining the fair value and useful life of the leased property and the appropriate reasonably certain lease term. These judgments may produce materially different amounts of rent expense in a given reporting period than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used. Insurance Reserves - We carry insurance programs with specific retention levels or high per-claim deductibles for a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation, general or liquor liability, health, property and management liability insurance programs. For some programs, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure relating to certain risks. We record a liability for all unresolved claims and for an estimate of incurred but not reported claims at the anticipated cost that falls below our specified retention levels or per-claim deductible amounts. Our liability for insurance claims was $54.3 million and $55.8 million as of December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 , respectively. In establishing our reserves, we consider certain actuarial assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions, the frequency and severity of claims and claim development history and settlement practices. Reserves recorded for workers compensation and general or liquor liability claims are discounted using the average of the one-year and five-year risk-free rate of monetary assets that have comparable maturities. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 50 basis point change in the discount rate in our insurance claim liabilities as of December 29, 2019 , would have affected net earnings by $0.8 million in 2019 . Stock-Based Compensation - We have a stock-based compensation plan that permits the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance awards and other stock-based awards to our management and other key employees. We account for our stock-based employee compensation using a fair value-based method of accounting. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Expected term is estimated based on historical exercise experience of our stock options. Dividend yield is the level of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock over the expected term of our options. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect as of the grant date. Forfeitures of share-based compensation awards are recognized as they occur. Estimates and assumptions are based upon information currently available, including historical experience and current business and economic conditions. A simultaneous 10% change in our volatility, forfeiture rate, weighted-average risk-free interest rate, dividend rate and term of grant in our stock option pricing model for 2019 would not have a material effect on net income. Our performance-based share units ( PSUs ) require assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving certain Company performance criteria set forth in the award agreements. Assumptions used in our assessment are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans . If we assumed that the PSU performance conditions for stock-based awards were not met, stock-based compensation expense would have decreased by $10.5 million for 2019 , including reversal of expense recorded in prior years. If we 52 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued assumed that all granted PSU share awards met or will meet their maximum threshold, expense would have increased by $1.7 million for 2019 . Income Taxes - Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates, based on certain judgments regarding enacted tax laws and published guidance, in effect in the years in which we expect those temporary differences to reverse. As of December 29, 2019 , tax loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards that do not have a valuation allowance are expected to be recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods. We currently expect to utilize general business tax credit carryforwards within a four to six year period. However, our ability to utilize these tax credits could be adversely impacted by, among other items, a future ownership change as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. A valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be realized. Changes in assumptions regarding our level and composition of earnings, tax laws or the deferred tax valuation allowance and the results of tax audits, may materially impact the effective income tax rate. Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by U.S. and foreign tax authorities. In determining taxable income, income or loss before taxes is adjusted for differences between local tax laws and generally accepted accounting principles. A tax benefit from an uncertain position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we recognize a liability. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits requires significant management judgment regarding exposures about our various tax positions. These assumptions and probabilities are reviewed and updated based upon new information. An unfavorable tax settlement generally requires the use of cash and an increase in the amount of income tax expense we recognize. Revenue Recognition - We sell gift cards to customers in our restaurants, through our websites and through select third parties. A liability is initially established for the value of the gift card when sold. We recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer. There is uncertainty when calculating gift card breakage, the amount of gift cards which will not be redeemed, because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the effects of future events. We recognize gift card breakage revenue using estimates based on historical redemption patterns. If actual redemptions vary from the estimated breakage, gift card breakage revenue may differ from the amount recorded. We periodically update our estimates used for breakage and apply that rate to gift card redemptions. A change in our breakage rate estimates by 50 basis points would have resulted in an adjustment in our breakage revenue of $2.0 million for 2019 . Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards For a description of recently issued Financial Accounting Standards that we adopted in 2019 and, that are applicable to us and likely to have material effect on our consolidated financial statements, but have not yet been adopted, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report. 53 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC.
