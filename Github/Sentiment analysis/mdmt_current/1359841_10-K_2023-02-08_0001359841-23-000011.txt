Overview Our Company Hanesbrands Inc. is a socially responsible leading marketer of everyday basic innerwear and activewear apparel in the Americas, Australia, Europe and Asia under some of the world strongest apparel brands, including Hanes, Champion, Bonds , Maidenform, Bali, Playtex, Bras N Things, JMS/Just My Size, Gear for Sports, Wonderbra, Berlei, Comfortwash and Alternative . We design, manufacture, source and sell a broad range of basic apparel such as T-shirts, bras, panties, shapewear, underwear, socks and activewear produced in our low-cost global supply chain. Our brands hold either the number one or number two market position by units sold in many of the product categories and geographies in which we compete. Our Segments Our operations are managed and reported in three operating segments, each of which is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes: Innerwear, Activewear and International. These segments are organized principally by product category and geographic location. Each segment has its own management team that is responsible for the operations of the segment businesses, but the segments share a common supply chain and media and marketing platforms. Other consists of our U.S.-based outlet stores, U.S. Sheer Hosiery business and certain sales from our supply chain to the European Innerwear business. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we reached the decision to divest our U.S. Sheer Hosiery business, including the L eggs brand, as part of our strategy to streamline our portfolio under our Full Potential plan. See Note Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 30 Table of Contents The reportable segments are as follows: Innerwear includes sales in the United States of basic branded apparel products that are replenishment in nature under the product categories of men underwear, women panties, children underwear and socks, and intimate apparel, which includes bras and shapewear. Innerwear also includes sales in the United States of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) including products such as cloth face coverings and gowns in 2020. Activewear includes sales in the United States of branded products that are primarily seasonal in nature to both retailers and wholesalers, as well as licensed sports apparel and licensed logo apparel. International primarily includes sales of our innerwear and activewear products, including PPE in 2020, outside the United States, primarily in Australia, E urope, Asia, Latin America and Canada. Impact of COVID-19 and Supply Chain Disruptions on Our Business The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business operations and financial results, as described in more detail under Consolidated Results of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2022 ( 2022 ) Compared with Year Ended January 1, 2022 ( 2021 ) and Consolidated Results of Operations - Year Ended January 1, 2022 ( 2021 ) Compared with Year Ended January 2, 2021 ( 2020 ) below, primarily through reduced traffic and closures of Company-operated and third-party retail locations in certain markets, global supply chain disruptions and higher levels of inflation due to factory disruptions, port congestion, transportation delays as well as labor and container shortages, which resulted in higher operating costs causing pressure on our gross and operating profit in 2022. At the height of the global supply chain disruptions in 2022, we experienced delayed inventory orders which, in turn, resulted in the inability to fulfill certain customer orders and decreased product availability in our Company-owned stores and e-commerce sites which negatively impacted our net revenues and increased net inventory levels. We took aggressive measures in 2022 to focus on reducing inventory units, including manufacturing time-out costs. While total net inventory levels remain above 2021, inventory units decreased by 6% at the end of 2022 compared to 2021. We expect gross and operating margin pressure to continue in the first half of fiscal 2023 as we sell through the remainder of our higher-cost inventory. We expect gross and operating margin pressure to ease in the second half of 2023 as lower cost inventory currently being produced is sold and we anniversary the manufacturing time-out costs related to our inventory reduction initiatives in 2022. The future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions and inflation remain highly uncertain, and our business and results of operations, including our net revenues, earnings and cash flows, could continue to be adversely impacted. See related risk factors in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Outlook for 2023 We estimate our 2023 guidance as follows: Net sales of approximately $6.05 billion to $6.20 billion, net of approximately $42 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact; Operating profit of approximately $446 million to $496 million, net of approximately $6 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact; Restructuring and other action-related charges totaling $60 million including Full Potential plan-related charges of approximately $54 million included in operating profit and refinancing charges of $6 million included in other expenses; Interest expense and other expenses of approximately $306 million combined; Tax expense from continuing operations of approximately $90 million to $100 million; Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of approximately $0.14 to $0.25; Cash flow from operating activities of approximately $500 million; and Capital investments of approximately $150 million, including capital expenditures of $70 million within investing cash flow activities and cloud computing assets of $80 million within operating cash flow activities. Business and Industry Trends Inflation and Changing Prices Cotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products. While we do not own yarn operations, we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton. Increases in the cost of cotton can result in higher costs in the price we pay for yarn from our large-scale yarn suppliers and may result in the need to implement future price increases in order to maintain 31 Table of Contents our margins. Decreases in cotton prices can lead to lower margins for inventory and products produced from cotton we have already purchased, particularly if there is downward price pressure as a result of consumer demand, competition or other factors. Our costs for cotton yarn, cotton-based textiles and cotton-based products sourced from third-party suppliers vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton, which is affected by, among other factors, weather, the impacts of climate change, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. We are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price we pay for yarn from our primary yarn suppliers in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton. Under our agreements with these suppliers, we have the ability to periodically fix the cotton cost component of our yarn purchases. When we elect to fix the cotton cost component under these agreements, interim fluctuations in the price of cotton do not impact the price we pay for the specified volume of yarn. The yarn suppliers bear the risk of cotton fluctuations for the yarn volume specified and it is their responsibility to procure the cotton at the agreed upon pricing through arrangements they make with their cotton suppliers. However, our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices. The cost of cotton used in our products, which includes the cost of cotton used in goods manufactured by us, as well as the cotton content in yarn, textiles and turnkey products we purchase from third-party suppliers, as a percentage of our cost of sales was in the high single digits in 2022. Costs incurred today for materials and labor, including cotton, typically do not impact our results until the inventory is sold approximately six to nine months later. Inflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins. For example, the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process, such as oil-related commodity prices and other raw materials, including cotton, dyes and chemicals, and other costs, such as fuel, energy and utility costs, can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors. Disruptions to the global supply chain due to factory closures, port congestion, container shortages, trucking capacity shortages, transportation delays and labor shortages may negatively impact product availability, revenue growth and gross margins. We would work to mitigate the impact of the global supply chain disruptions through a combination of cost savings and operating efficiencies, as well as pricing actions, which could have an adverse impact on demand. Costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold. In addition, a significant portion of our products are manufactured in countries other than the United States and declines in the value of the U.S. dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs. Increases in inflation may not be matched by growth in consumer income, which also could have a negative impact on spending. Other Business and Industry Trends The basic apparel market is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. Competition generally is based upon brand, comfort, fit, style, innovation and price. The majority of our core styles continue from year to year, with variations only in color, fabric or design details. Some products, however, such as intimate apparel and activewear, do have more of an emphasis on style. Our businesses face competition today from other large domestic and foreign corporations and manufacturers, as well as smaller companies, department stores, specialty stores and other retailers that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands. In 2022, our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 45% of our total net sales. Our top customer, Walmart, accounted for 16% of our total net sales in 2022. The increasing bargaining power of retailers can create pricing pressures as our customers grow larger and seek greater concessions in their purchase of our products, while also demanding exclusivity with respect to some of our products. To counteract these effects, it has become increasingly important to leverage our national brands through investment in our largest and strongest brands as our customers strive to maximize their performance especially in today challenging retail economic environment. Brands are important in our core categories to drive traffic and project the quality and value our customers demand. Consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online through e-commerce platforms. As a result, an increasing portion of our revenue across all channels is being generated online through e-commerce platforms. We are continuing to develop and expand our omnichannel capabilities to allow a consumer to use more than one channel when making a purchase, including in-store, at one of our retail or outlet stores or those of our retail partners, online or with a mobile device, through one of our branded websites, the website of one of our retail partners, or an online retailer. In addition to broadening our assortment of product offerings across all online channels, we are also increasing the proportion of our media budget dedicated to digital marketing. Foreign Exchange Rates Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies can impact our financial results in two ways; a translation impact and a transaction impact. The translation impact refers to the impact that changes in exchange rates can have on our published financial results. Similar to many multi-national corporations that publish financial results in U.S. dollars, our revenue and profit earned in local foreign currencies is translated back into U.S. dollars using an average exchange rate over the 32 Table of Contents representative period. A period of strengthening in the U.S. dollar has a negative impact to our published financial results (because it would take more units of a local currency to convert into a dollar). The opposite is true during a period of weakening in the U.S. dollar. Our biggest foreign currency exposures are the Australian dollar and the Euro. We use cross-currency swap contracts and nonderivative financial instruments to minimize material foreign currency translation exposures. The transaction impact on financial results is common for apparel companies that source goods because these goods are purchased in U.S. dollars. The transaction impact from a strengthening U.S. dollar would have a negative impact to our financial results (because the U.S. dollar-based costs would convert into a higher amount of local currency units, which means a higher local-currency cost of goods, and in turn, a lower local-currency gross profit). The transaction impact from exchange rates is typically recovered over time with price increases. However, during periods of rapid change in exchange rates, pricing is unable to change quickly enough; therefore, we use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against our sourcing costs to minimize our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates. Our Key Business Strategies Our business strategy integrates our brand superiority, industry-leading innovation and low-cost global supply chain to provide higher value products while lowering production costs. We operate in the global innerwear and global activewear apparel categories. These are stable, heavily branded categories where we have a strong consumer franchise based on a global portfolio of industry-leading brands that we have built over multiple decades, through hundreds of millions of direct interactions with consumers. Our multi-year growth strategy ( Full Potential plan ) focuses on four pillars to drive growth and enhance long-term profitability and identifies the initiatives to unlock growth. Our four pillars of growth are to grow the Champion brand globally, drive growth in Innerwear with brands and products that appeal to younger consumers, build e-commerce excellence across channels and streamline our global portfolio. In order to deliver this growth and create a more efficient and productive business model, we have launched a multi-year cost savings program intended to self-fund the investments necessary to achieve the Full Potential plan objectives. We remain highly confident that our strong brand portfolio, world-class supply chain and diverse category and geographic footprint will help us unlock our full potential, deliver long-term growth and create stockholder value. In the first quarter of 2021, we announced that we reached the decision to exit our European Innerwear business as part of our strategy to streamline our portfolio under our Full Potential plan and determined that this business met held-for-sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria. Accordingly, we began to separately report the results of our European Innerwear business as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income, and to present the related assets and liabilities as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. On November 4, 2021, we announced that we reached an agreement to sell this business to an affiliate of Regent, L.P., and completed the sale on March 5, 2022. Under the agreement, the purchaser received all the assets and operating liabilities of the European Innerwear business. See Note Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we reached the decision to divest our U.S. Sheer Hosiery business, including the L eggs brand, as part of our strategy to streamline our portfolio under our Full Potential plan and determined that this business met held-for-sale accounting criteria. The related assets and liabilities are presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022. The operations of our U.S. Sheer Hosiery business are reported in Other for all periods presented in Note Business Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are currently exploring potential purchasers for this business and expect to complete the sale within the next 12 months. See Note Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. In June of 2022, we purchased the Champion trademark for footwear in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada from Keds, LLC ( KEDS ) for $103 million. The trademark was recorded in Trademarks and other identifiable intangibles, net line in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and has an indefinite life. We previously licensed the Champion trademark for footwear in these locations. The purchase of the trademark was part of an agreement with KEDS settling litigation between the two parties and is another step forward in our Full Potential plan of growing the global Champion brand. We seek to generate strong cash flow through effectively optimizing our capital structure and managing working capital levels. We recently shifted our capital allocation strategy to focus the use of all our free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) on reducing debt and bringing our leverage back to a range that is no greater than two to three times on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization excluding restructuring and other action-related costs and stock compensation expense. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. 33 Table of Contents Ransomware Attack As previously disclosed, on May 24, 2022, we identified that we had become subject to a ransomware attack and activated our incident response and business continuity plans designed to contain the incident. As part of our forensic investigation and assessment of the impact, we determined that certain of our information technology systems were affected by the ransomware attack. Upon discovering the incident, we took a series of measures to further safeguard the integrity of our information technology systems, including working with cybersecurity experts to contain the incident and implementing business continuity plans to restore and support continued operations. These measures also included resecuring data, remediation of the malware across infected machines, rebuilding critical systems, global password reset and enhanced security monitoring. We notified appropriate law enforcement authorities as well as certain data protection regulators, and in addition to our public announcements of the incident, we provided breach notifications and regulatory filings as required by applicable law starting in August 2022. At this time, we believe the incident has been contained, we have restored our critical information technology systems, and manufacturing, retail and other internal operations continue. There is no ongoing operational impact on our ability to provide our products and services. We maintain insurance, including coverage for cyber-attacks, subject to certain deductibles and policy limitations, in an amount that we believe appropriate. We are named in two pending lawsuits in connection with our previously disclosed ransomware incident. On October 7, 2022, a putative class action was filed against Hanes Brands [sic], Inc. alleging, among other things, negligence, negligence per se, breach of implied contract, unjust enrichment, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unfair business practices under the California Business and Professions Code, and violations of the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act in connection with the ransomware incident. The litigation is entitled, Roman v. Hanes Brands [sic], Inc., and is pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Plaintiff Roman also subsequently filed a second putative class action with regard to the ransomware incident in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina on January 16, 2023, entitled Roman v. Hanesbrands,[sic] Inc., which was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on January 20, 2023. On October 13, 2022, another putative class action was filed against HanesBrands Inc. alleging, among other things, negligence, negligence per se, breach of implied contract, invasion of privacy, and unjust enrichment in connection with the ransomware incident. The litigation is entitled, Toussaint v. HanesBrands,[sic] Inc. and is pending in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. The pending lawsuits seek, among other things, monetary and injunctive relief. We are vigorously defending these matters and believe the cases are without merit. We do not expect any of these claims, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, at this early stage in the proceedings, we are not able to determine the probability of the outcome of these matters or a range of reasonably expected losses, if any. We maintain insurance, including coverage for cyber-attacks, subject to certain deductibles and policy limitations, in an amount that we believe appropriate. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred costs of approximately $15 million, net of expected insurance recoveries, related to the ransomware attack. The costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 included $14 million related primarily to supply chain disruptions, which are reflected in the Cost of sales line of the Consolidated Statements of Income and $1 million, net of expected insurance recoveries, related primarily to legal, information technology and consulting fees, which are reflected in the Selling, general and administrative expenses line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. The ransomware attack also negatively impacted our ability to order materials, make and ship orders, and process payments during the second quarter ended July 2, 2022, resulting in estimated lost sales of approximately $100 million. We continue to assess the security event and cannot determine, at this time, the full extent of the impact from such event on our business, results of operations or financial condition or whether such impact will ultimately have a material adverse effect. Financing Arrangements In November 2022 and in February 2023, given the economic conditions and the associated impact on earnings, we amended the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility to modify the financial covenants in order to avoid a potential covenant violation and to provide operating flexibility as described in Note Debt to our consolidated financial statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We expect to maintain compliance with our covenants, as amended in February 2023, for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements based on our current expectations and forecasts, however economic conditions or the occurrence of events discussed under Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or other SEC filings could impact our ability to maintain compliance or require us to seek additional amendments to the credit agreement. We intend to refinance certain of our indebtedness with upcoming maturities, including an aggregate of approximately $1.4 billion of our 4.625% Senior Notes due in May 2024 and our 3.5% Senior Notes due in June 2024 in the first quarter of 2023. Any such refinancings will depend on market conditions and other relevant factors and there can be no assurance such refinancings will be pursued or completed. 34 Table of Contents Tax Expense For the year ended December 31, 2022, our effective tax rate was impacted as a result of a valuation allowance recorded in 2022 against U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. Additionally, the Company effective tax rate was impacted by tax impairments in Switzerland which generated deferred tax liabilities. We maintain intercompany transfer pricing agreements governing sales within our self-owned supply chain, which can impact the amount of pre-tax income we recognize in foreign jurisdictions. In compliance with applicable tax laws, we regularly review the terms of these agreements utilizing independent third-party transfer pricing studies to ensure that intercompany pricing is consistent with what a seller would charge an independent, arm length customer, or what a buyer would pay an independent, arm length supplier. Therefore, changes in intercompany pricing are often driven by market conditions, which are also difficult to predict. Future acquisitions or divestitures may affect the proportion of our pre-tax income from foreign jurisdictions, both due to external sales and also increased volume in our self-owned supply chain. We follow a disciplined acquisition strategy focused on acquisitions that meet strict criteria for strong likely returns with relatively low risk. It is difficult to predict whether or when such acquisitions or divestitures will occur and whether the acquisition targets or divested operations will be foreign or domestic. Therefore, it is also difficult to predict the effect of acquisitions or divestitures on the future distribution of our pre-tax income. As of December 31, 2022, we have continued to evaluate our glo bal capital allocation strategy a nd assertions made with respect to the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. As a result of our overall and continuous evaluation, we have not changed our assertion from prior year and we will continue to permanently reinvest a portion of our unremitted foreign earnings. The portion of our unremitted foreign earnings as of December 31, 2022 that we intend to remit to the United States totals approximately $269 million. We intend to use these earnings to fund capital investments and reduce debt held in the United States. The remaining portion of our unremitted foreign earnings will continue to be permanently reinvested to fund working capital requirements and operations abroad. As of December 31, 2022, we have accrued for income taxes of $26 million in connection with the $269 million of unremitted foreign earnings we intend to remit in the future. These income tax effects include United States federal, state, foreign and withholding tax implications in accordance with the planned remittance of such foreign earnings. We regularly assess any significant exposure associated with increases in effective tax rates and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustment to our income tax provisions. See We have a complex multinational tax structure, and changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could impact our capital deployment strategy and adversely affect our results. in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 2022 Key Financial Results Key financial results are as follows: Total net sales in 2022 were $6.2 billion, compared with $6.8 billion in 2021, representing an 8% decrease. Operating profit was $520 million in 2022 compared with $798 million in 2021, representing a 35% decrease. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 8.3% in 2022 compared to 11.7% in 2021. Included within operating profit in 2022 and 2021 were charges of $60 million and $132 million, respectively, related to the implementation of our Full Potential plan. Diluted loss per share from continuing operations was $0.37 in 2022 compared with diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.48 in 2021. 35 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2022 ( 2022 ) Compared with Year Ended January 1, 2022 ( 2021 ) Years Ended December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Higher (Lower) Percent Change (dollars in thousands) Net sales $ 6,233,650 $ 6,801,240 $ (567,590) (8.3) % Cost of sales 4,012,542 4,149,541 (136,999) (3.3) Gross profit 2,221,108 2,651,699 (430,591) (16.2) Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,701,563 1,853,971 (152,408) (8.2) Operating profit 519,545 797,728 (278,183) (34.9) Other expenses 9,734 53,586 (43,852) (81.8) Interest expense, net 157,073 163,067 (5,994) (3.7) Income from continuing operations before income tax expense 352,738 581,075 (228,337) (39.3) Income tax expense 483,907 60,107 423,800 705.1 Income (loss) from continuing operations (131,169) 520,968 (652,137) (125.2) Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 3,965 (443,744) 447,709 (100.9) Net income (loss) $ (127,204) $ 77,224 $ (204,428) (264.7) % Net Sales Net sales decreased 8% during 2022 primarily due to the following: Softer point-of-sale trends and higher retailer inventory levels as a result of the macroeconomic pressures; The impact of the ransomware attack to the business; Global supply chain disruptions resulting in product delays; Ongoing COVID-related pressures on consumer traffic in certain markets in Asia; and The unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates in our International business of approximately $182 million. Partially offset by: Pricing actions taken throughout 2022. Operating Profit Operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 8.3% in 2022, representing a decrease from 11.7% in the prior year. Operating margin decreased as a result of lower sales volume, input cost inflation, impact from the ransomware attack, costs associated with our manufacturing time-out inventory reduction actions, deleverage from a higher proportion of transportation and distribution costs, unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates and increased Full Potential plan-related investments in brand marketing and technology partially offset by pricing actions and cost reduction actions. Included in operating profit in 2022 and 2021 were charges of $60 million and $132 million, respectively, related to the implementation of our Full Potential plan. Other Highlights Other Expenses Other expenses decreased in 2022 compared to prior year primarily as a result of the refinancing of our Senior Secured Credit Facility and the redemption of our 5.375% Senior Notes in November 2021. Redemption of our 5.375% Senior Notes in 2021 required payment of a make-whole premium of $35 million. Additionally, the redemption of our 5.375% Senior Notes and the refinancing of our Senior Secured Credit Facility in 2021 resulted in a charge of $11 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and fees incurred. See Note Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other expenses also included higher funding fees for sales of accounts receivable to financial institutions which were partially offset by lower pension expense in 2022. Interest Expense Interest expense was lower by $6 million in 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to a lower weighted average interest rate on our borrowings partially offset by higher weighted average outstanding debt balances during 2022. Our weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt was 3.79% for 2022, compared to 4.06% for 2021. 36 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense Our effective income tax rate was 137.2% and 10.3% for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for 2022 was primarily due to non-cash discrete tax charges of $423 million for valuation allowances established against U.S. deferred tax assets and tax impairments in Switzerland which generated deferred tax liabilities during 2022. Discontinued Operations The results of our discontinued operations include the operations of our European Innerwear business which we reached the decision to exit at the end of the first quarter of 2021 in connection with our Full Potential plan. On March 5, 2022, we completed the sale of the European Innerwear business. See Note Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Operating Results by Business Segment Year Ended December 31, 2022 ( 2022 ) Compared with Year Ended January 1, 2022 ( 2021 ) Net Sales Years Ended December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Higher (Lower) Percent Change (dollars in thousands) Innerwear $ 2,429,966 $ 2,719,788 $ (289,822) (10.7) % Activewear 1,555,062 1,679,639 (124,577) (7.4) International 1,914,268 2,066,249 (151,981) (7.4) Other 334,354 335,564 (1,210) (0.4) Total $ 6,233,650 $ 6,801,240 $ (567,590) (8.3) % Operating Profit and Margin Years Ended December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Higher (Lower) Percent Change (dollars in thousands) Innerwear $ 388,586 16.0 % $ 573,852 21.1 % $ (185,266) (32.3) % Activewear 153,710 9.9 236,400 14.1 (82,690) (35.0) International 283,036 14.8 339,317 16.4 (56,281) (16.6) Other 17,019 5.1 30,922 9.2 (13,903) (45.0) Corporate (322,806) NM (382,763) NM 59,957 (15.7) Total $ 519,545 8.3 % $ 797,728 11.7 % $ (278,183) (34.9) % Innerwear Innerwear net sales decreased 11% compared to prior year primarily due to softer point-of-sale trends, impacts to replenishment orders from retailers decisions to reduce broader inventory positions, business disruption as a result of the ransomware attack in the second quarter of 2022 and the overlap of last year sales benefits from retailer restocking and government-stimulus spending partially offset by pricing actions taken and retail space gains in the first quarter of 2022 . Innerwear operating margin was 16.0%, a decrease from 21.1% in the same period a year ago. The operating margin decline resulted from input cost inflation, lower sales volume, unfavorable product and channel mix, manufacturing time-out costs associated with our inventory reduction actions and deleverage from a higher proportion of distribution costs partially offset by pricing actions and cost reduction actions. Activewear Activewear net sales decreased 7% compared to prior year primarily due to softer point-of-sale trends primarily related to the Champion brand, retailer inventory levels and business disruption as a result of the ransomware attack in the second quarter of 2022. The net sales decrease was partially offset by growth in the collegiate and printwear channels and pricing actions primarily taken in the third quarter of 2022. Activewear operating margin was 9.9%, a decrease from 14.1% in the same period a year ago. The operating margin decline resulted from higher levels of inflation, lower sales volume, deleverage from a higher proportion of distribution costs, manufacturing time-out costs associated with our inventory reduction actions and unfavorable product mix and partially offset by pricing actions and cost reduction actions. 37 Table of Contents International Net sales in the International segment decreased 7% compared to prior year due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates decreased net sales approximately $182 million in 2022. International net sales on a constant currency basis, defined as net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency, increased 1%. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates is calculated by applying prior period exchange rates to the current year financial results. Net sales on a constant currency basis increased as a result of Champion growth in Europe as well as innerwear growth in Australia and the Americas. The increase in net sales was partially offset by Champion declines in certain Asian markets. International operating margin was 14.8%, a decrease from 16.4% in the same period a year ago. The decrease in operating margin primarily resulted from input cost inflation, which was partially offset by disciplined expense management during 2022. Other Other net sales decreased primarily as a result of lower sales at our retail outlets during 2022 compared to prior year partially offset by increased sales from our supply chain to the European Innerwear business. We have continued certain sales from our supply chain to this business on a transitional basis after the sale in the first quarter of 2022. These sales and the related profit are included in Other in all periods presented and have not been eliminated as intercompany transactions in consolidation for the period when this business was owned by us. See Note Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Operating margin decreased due to the decrease in sales volume primarily in our retail outlets. Corporate Corporate expenses were lower in 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower restructuring and other action-related charges and lower variable compensation costs partially offset by increased information technology costs coupled with expenses, net of expected insurance recoveries, related to the ransomware attack which occurred during the second quarter of 2022. During 2022, we incurred costs of approximately $15 million, net of expected insurance recoveries, related to the ransomware attack which included $14 million related primarily to supply chain disruptions, which are reflected in the Cost of sales line of the Consolidated Statements of Income and $1 million, net of expected insurance recoveries, related primarily to legal, information technology and consulting fees, which are reflected in the Selling, general and administrative expenses line of the Consolidated Statements of Income . Included in restructuring and other action-related charges within operating profit in 2022 and 2021 were $60 million and $132 million, respectively, of charges related to the implementation of our Full Potential plan. Full Potential plan charges in 2022 included charges related to supply chain segmentation of $18 million to position our manufacturing network to align with revenue growth opportunities of our Full Potential plan demand trends, $10 million related to corporate headcount reductions and a non-cash gain of $4 million to adjust the valuation allowance related to the U.S. Sheer Hosiery business resulting from a decrease in carrying value due to changes in working capital. Full Potential plan charges in 2021 included a charge of $16 million for an action to resize our U.S. corporate office workforce through a voluntary retirement program and impairment charges of $7 million related to the full impairment of an indefinite-lived trademark related to a 38 Table of Contents specific brand within the European Innerwear business that was excluded from the disposal group as it was not marketed for sale. The components of restructuring and other action-related charges were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 (dollars in thousands) Restructuring and other action-related charges: Full Potential plan: Professional services $ 23,994 $ 44,617 Supply chain segmentation 17,982 5,419 Technology 11,922 4,617 Operating model 8,221 23,191 Impairment of intangible assets 7,302 (Gain) loss on sale of business and classification of assets held for sale (3,535) 38,364 Other 1,274 8,200 Total included in operating profit 59,858 131,710 Early extinguishment and refinancing of debt included in other expenses 45,699 Total included in income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense 59,858 177,409 Discrete tax (expense) benefit (422,918) 27,147 Tax effect on actions 9,152 26,518 Total included in income tax (expense) benefit (413,766) 53,665 Total restructuring and other action-related charges $ 473,624 $ 123,744 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Requirements and Trends and Uncertainties Affecting Liquidity We rely on our cash flows generated from operations and the borrowing capacity under our credit facilities to meet the cash requirements of our business. We recently shifted our capital allocation strategy to utilize our cash from operations for payments to our employees and vendors in the normal course of business and to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures. We then plan to utilize our free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) to pay down debt to bring our leverage back to a range that is no greater than two to three times on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis. Based on our current estimate of future earnings and cash flows, we believe we have sufficient cash and available borrowings for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements based on our current expectations and forecasts. In November 2022 and in February 2023, given the economic conditions and the associated impact on earnings, we amended the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility to modify the financial covenants in order to avoid a potential covenant violation and to provide operating flexibility. The amendments effect changes to certain provisions and covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facility during the period beginning with the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 and continuing through the fiscal quarter ending March 30, 2024, or such earlier date as we may elect (such period of time, the Covenant Relief Period ), including: (a) an increase in the maximum consolidated net total leverage ratio 5.25 to 1.00 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, 6.75 to 1.00 for the quarter ending April 1, 2023, 7.25 to 1.00 for the quarter ending July 1, 2023, 6.75 to 1.00 for the quarter ending September 30, 2023, 5.25 to 1.00 for the quarter ending December 30, 2023, and 5.00 to 1.00 for the quarter ending March 30, 2024, and reverting back to 4.50 to 1.00 for each quarter after the Covenant Relief Period has ended; (b) a reduction of the minimum interest coverage ratio from 3.00 to 1.00 to 2.60 to 1.00 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and the quarter ending April 1, 2023, 2.00 to 1.00 for the quarters ending July 1, 2023, September 30, 2023 and December 30, 2023, and 2.50 to 1.00 for the quarter ending March 30, 2024, with an increase to 2.75 to 1.00 for each quarter after the Covenant Relief Period has ended; (c) suspension of restricted payments in connection with share repurchases; (d) suspension of restricted payments pursuant to the Company's leverage ratio-based and "Available Amount" restricted payments baskets, (e) a cap on annual dividend payments of $75 million, which will revert back to the greater of (x) $350 million and (y) 8.0% of Total Tangible Assets after the Covenant Relief Period has ended; (f) suspension of the Company Available Amount basket for investments in foreign subsidiaries and other investments; (g) suspension of the 0.50 to 1.00 increase in the maximum permitted consolidated net total leverage ratio resulting from a material permitted acquisition; and (h) the addition of two new tiers to the top of the pricing grid if the maximum consolidated net total leverage ratio exceeds 5.00 to 1.00 and 5.50 to 1.00. In conjunction with the Second Amendment, we transitioned the Senior Secured Credit Facility from the London Interbank Offered Rate to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate with a 10 basis points credit spread adjustment already included in the Senior Secured Credit Facility. In addition, the Third Amendment limits the 39 Table of Contents Company's ability to incur incremental secured indebtedness during the Covenant Relief Period to $1.75 billion, subject to compliance with the financial covenants. We expect to maintain compliance with our covenants, as amended in February 2023, for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements based on our current expectations and forecasts. If economic conditions worsen and our earnings and operating cash flows do not start to recover as currently estimated by management, this could impact our ability to maintain compliance with our amended financial covenants and require us to seek additional amendments to our Senior Secured Credit Facility. If we are not able to obtain such necessary additional amendments, this would lead to an event of default and, if not cured timely, our lenders could require us to repay our outstanding debt. In that situation, we may not be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital, or divest assets, to refinance or repay the lenders. We intend to refinance certain of our indebtedness with upcoming maturities, including an aggregate of approximately $1.4 billion of our 4.625% Senior Notes due in May 2024 and our 3.5% Senior Notes due in June 2024 in the first quarter of 2023. Any such refinancings will depend on market conditions and other relevant factors and there can be no assurance such refinancings will be pursued or completed. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from global operations and cash available under our Revolving Loan Facility, our accounts receivable securitization facility (the ARS Facility ) and our other international credit facilities. We had the following borrowing capacity and available liquidity under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2022: As of December 31, 2022 Borrowing Capacity Available Liquidity (dollars in thousands) Senior Secured Credit Facility: Revolving Loan Facility (1) $ 1,000,000 $ 642,546 ARS Facility (2) 222,693 13,193 Other international credit facilities 65,964 32,266 Total liquidity from credit facilities $ 1,288,657 $ 688,005 Cash and cash equivalents 238,413 Total liquidity $ 926,418 (1) A portion of the Revolving Loan Facility is available to be borrowed in Euros or Australian dollars. (2) Borrowing availability under the ARS Facility is subject to a quarterly fluctuating facility limit, not to exceed $225 million and permitted only to the extent that the face of the receivables in the collateral pool, net of applicable reserves and other deductions, exceeds the outstanding loans. The following have impacted or may impact our liquidity: We intend to refinance certain of our indebtedness with upcoming maturities, including an aggregate of approximately $1.4 billion of our 4.625% Senior Notes due 2024 and our 3.5% Senior Notes due 2024 in the first quarter of 2023. Any such refinancings will depend on market conditions and other relevant factors and there can be no assurance such refinancings will be pursued or completed. We have principal and interest obligations under our debt and ongoing financial covenants under those debt facilities. The COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business. During 2022, we entered into transactions to repurchase approximately 1.6 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $25 million including broker commissions. At December 31, 2022, the remaining repurchase authorization under our current share repurchase program announced on February 2, 2022 totaled approximately $575 million. Although we have historically paid a regular quarterly dividend, the Hanesbrands Board of Directors eliminated our quarterly cash dividend as we recently shifted our capital allocation strategy to pay down debt to bring our leverage back to a range that is no greater than two to three times on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis. The declaration of any future dividends and, if declared, the amount of any such dividends, will be subject to our actual future earnings, capital requirements, regulatory restrictions, debt covenants, other contractual restrictions and to the discretion of our Board of Directors. We have invested in efforts to accelerate worldwide omnichannel and global growth initiatives, as well as marketing and brand building. 40 Table of Contents We have launched a multi-year cost savings program intended to self-fund the investments necessary to achieve our Full Potential plan objectives. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $150 million in 2023, including capital expenditures of $70 million within investing cash flow activities and cloud computing assets of $80 million within operating cash flow activities. In the future, we may pursue strategic business acquisitions or divestitures. We made no cash contribution to our U.S. pension plans in 2022 and we expect to have no required cash contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2023 based on a preliminary calculation by our actuary. We may also elect to make additional voluntary contributions. Our U.S. qualified pension plans were approximately 96% and 97% funded as of December 1, 2022 and 2021, respectively, under the Pension Protection Act funding rules. We may increase or decrease the portion of the current-year income of our foreign subsidiaries that we remit to the United States, which could impact our effective income tax rate. We have not changed our reinvestment strategy from the prior year with regards to our unremitted foreign earnings and intend to remit foreign earnings totaling $269 million. Future Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table contains information on our material contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2022, and their expected timing on future cash flows and liquidity. Payments Due by Period At December 31, 2022 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2024-2025 Fiscal 2026-2027 Fiscal 2028 and Thereafter (dollars in thousands) Operating activities: Interest on debt obligations (1) $ 524,261 $ 188,119 $ 258,896 $ 77,246 $ Inventory purchase obligations 416,375 403,316 13,059 Operating lease obligations (2) 499,583 127,996 183,172 119,381 69,034 Defined benefit plan minimum contributions (3) Tax obligations (4) 90,934 37,527 49,714 3,693 Other obligations (5) 370,209 136,895 127,040 55,419 50,855 Investing activities: Capital expenditures 59,365 57,501 1,864 Financing activities: Debt 3,872,275 247,000 1,547,775 2,077,500 Total $ 5,833,002 $ 1,198,354 $ 2,181,520 $ 2,333,239 $ 119,889 (1) Interest obligations on floating rate debt instruments are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect at December 31, 2022. (2) As of December 31, 2022, our operating lease obligations exclude $55 million of additional operating lease commitments that have not yet commenced. These operating lease liabilities will be paid over a period of 10 years. (3) Represents only the required minimum pension contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan in the current year. We expect to have no required cash contributions to our U.S. pension plan in 2023 based on a preliminary calculation by our actuary although we may elect to make voluntary contributions to maintain certain funded levels. For a discussion of our pension plan obligations, see Note Defined Benefit Pension Plans to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (4) Represents current tax liabilities, uncertain tax positions and transition tax liabilities resulting from the Tax Act. (5) Primarily represents the projected payments for liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for royalty-bearing license agreements, information technology services, certain employee benefit claims, deferred compensation, and marketing and advertising obligations. 41 Table of Contents Sources and Uses of Our Cash The information presented below regarding the sources and uses of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 was derived from our consolidated financial statements. Years Ended December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 (dollars in thousands) Operating activities $ (358,802) $ 623,409 Investing activities (216,428) (52,455) Financing activities 295,829 (888,020) Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash (42,815) (32,908) Change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (322,216) (349,974) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 560,629 910,603 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 238,413 $ 560,629 Operating Activities Our overall liquidity has historically been driven by our cash flow provided by operating activities, which is dependent on net income and changes in our working capital. As compared to the prior year, higher net cash used by operating activities was due to changes in working capital primarily accounts payable, accruals, inventory due to inflationary increases, softer point-of-sale trends and supply chain disruptions, and increased capital investments in our cloud computing assets partially offset by improvement in accounts receivable and lower pension plan contributions in 2022. Net cash from operating activities includes a $40 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan made in the first quarter of 2021. Investing Activities The increase in cash used by investing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily the result of the purchase of the Champion trademark for footwear in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada from Keds, LLC for $103 million, the sale of the European Innerwear business which resulted in an $11 million cash outflow and an increase in capital investments into our business. Financing Activities Net cash from financing activities increased in 2022 primarily as a result of increased borrowings on our ARS Facility and our Revolving Loan Facility coupled with the repayment of the outstanding balance of Term Loan B in 2021, which consisted of a required excess cash flow prepayment of $239 million and a voluntary prepayment of $61 million, the amendment and restatement of our Senior Secured Credit Facility which resulted in payment of $8 million for debt issuance costs in 2021, and the redemption of our $700 million 5.375% Senior Notes which required payment of a make-whole premium of $35 million in 2021. Net cash from financing activities in 2022 also included shares repurchased at a total cost of $25 million and Term Loan A scheduled payments of $25 million. Financing Arrangements In June 2022, we amended the ARS Facility. This amendment primarily increased the fluctuating facility limit to $225 million (previously $175 million) and extended the maturity date to June 2023. Additionally, the amendment changed our interest rate option as defined in the ARS Facility from the rate announced from time to time by PNC Bank, N.A. as its prime rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate to the rate announced from time to time by PNC Bank, N.A. as its prime rate or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate and increased certain receivables to the pledged collateral pool for the facility. We believe our financing structure provides a secure base to support our operations and key business strategies. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit facilities and other outstanding indebtedness. Under the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, among other financial and non-financial covenants, we are required to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum total debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation expense and amortization, as computed pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit Facility), or leverage ratio, each of which is defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The method of calculating all of the components used in the covenants is included in the Senior Secured Credit Facility. In November 2022 and in February 2023, given the uncertain economic environment and the associated impact on future earnings, we amended the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility prior to any potential covenant violation in order to modify the financial covenants and to provide operating flexibility as described in Note Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We expect to maintain compliance with our covenants, as amended in February 2023, for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements based on our current expectations and forecasts, however economic conditions or the 42 Table of Contents occurrence of events discussed under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or other SEC filings could impact our ability to maintain compliance or require us to seek additional amendments to the credit agreement. We intend to refinance certain of our indebtedness with upcoming maturities, including an aggregate of approximately $1.4 billion of our 4.625% Senior Notes due in May 2024 and our 3.5% Senior Notes due in June 2024 in the first quarter of 2023. Any such refinancings will depend on market conditions and other relevant factors and there can be no assurance such refinancings will be pursued or completed. For further details regarding our liquidity from our available cash balances and credit facilities see Cash Requirements and Trends and Uncertainties Affecting Liquidity above. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report our operating results and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The application of critical accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known. The critical accounting policies that involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements, or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors, are described below: Sales Recognition and Incentives We recognize revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied, which occurs at a point in time, upon either shipment or delivery to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods, which includes estimates for variable consideration. We record provisions for any uncollectible amounts based upon our historical collection statistics and current customer information. Our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience. Note Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (d) Sales Recognition and Incentives to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K describes a variety of sales incentives that we offer to resellers and consumers of our products. Measuring the cost of these incentives requires, in many cases, estimating future customer utilization and redemption rates. We use historical data for similar transactions to estimate the cost of current incentive programs. Our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience and other available information. We classify the costs associated with cooperative advertising as a reduction in the Net sales line in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Accounts Receivable Valuation Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers. We carry our accounts receivable at their net realizable value. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, we evaluate our receivables on a collection (pool) basis which are aggregated based on similar risk characteristics and consider a combination of factors, such as historical losses, the aging of trade receivables, industry trends, and our customers financial strength, credit standing and payment and default history. Changes in the characteristics of our accounts receivables and the aforementioned factors, among others, are reviewed quarterly and may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts. The calculation of the required allowance involves judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables. Charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts are reflected in the Selling, general and administrative expenses line and charges to the allowance for customer chargebacks and other customer deductions are primarily reflected as a reduction in the Net sales line in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a large reserve might be required. The amount of actual historical losses has not varied materially from our estimates for bad debts. Inventory Valuation We carry inventory on our balance sheet at the estimated lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out, or FIFO, method for our inventories. We carry obsolete, damaged and excess inventory at the net realizable value, which 43 Table of Contents we determine by assessing historical recovery rates, current market conditions and our future marketing and sales plans. Because our assessment of net realizable value is made at a point in time, there are inherent uncertainties related to our value determination. Market factors and other conditions underlying the net realizable value may change, resulting in further reserve requirements. A reduction in the carrying amount of an inventory item from cost to market value creates a new cost basis for the item that cannot be reversed at a later period. While we believe that adequate write-downs for inventory obsolescence have been provided in the consolidated financial statements, consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory write-downs in the future. Rebates, discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item, and are therefore reflected in the Cost of Sales line in our Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory item is sold. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the income tax basis of our assets and liabilities, as well as for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, at tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions, the amount and timing of which are uncertain, and on possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies. If in our judgment it appears that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized, valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets, which increase income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. These assessments of uncertain tax positions contain judgments related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business. The judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits, expiration of statutes of limitations, as well as changes to, or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations. Income tax expense is adjusted in our Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which these events occur. Assets and Liabilities Acquired in Business Combinations We account for business combinations using the purchase method, which requires us to allocate the cost of an acquired business to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize the excess of an acquired business cost over the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities as goodwill. We use a variety of information sources to determine the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities. We generally use third-party appraisers to assist management in determination of the fair value and lives of property and identifiable intangibles, consulting actuaries to assist management in determining the fair value of obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans and legal counsel to assist management in assessing obligations associated with legal and environmental claims. Trademarks and Other Identifiable Intangibles Trademarks, license agreements, customer and distributor relationships and computer software are our primary identifiable intangible assets. We amortize identifiable intangibles determined to have finite lives over their estimated useful lives, and we do not amortize identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives. As of December 31, 2022, the net book value of trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets was $1.3 billion, of which we are amortizing a balance of $111 million. We anticipate that our amortization expense for 2023 will be approximately $30 million. We evaluate identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment at least annually and as triggering events occur, such as significant adverse changes in business climate, several periods of operating or cash flow losses, forecasted continued losses or a current expectation that an intangible asset value will be eliminated prior to the end of its useful life. We estimate an intangible asset useful life based on historical experience, the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows, future business plans and the period over which the asset will be economically useful to us. Our policies require that we periodically review our assets remaining depreciable lives based upon actual experience and expected future utilization. A change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated amortization is accounted for in the period of change and future periods. We assess identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment at least annually, as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter, and more often as triggering events occur. In order to determine the impairment of identifiable intangible assets, we compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. Fair values of intangible assets are 44 Table of Contents primarily based on future cash flows projected to be generated from that asset. We recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which an identifiable intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value. In connection with our annual impairment testing performed in the third quarter of 2022, we performed a quantitative assessment, utilizing an income approach to estimate the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset. The most significant assumptions include the weighted average cost of capital, revenue growth rate, terminal growth rate and operating profit margin, all of which are used to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. The tests indicated the indefinite-lived intangible assets had fair values that exceeded their carrying values and no impairment of trademarks or other identifiable intangible assets was identified as a result of our annual testing conducted in 2022. Goodwill As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.1 billion of goodwill. We do not amortize goodwill, but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur. The timing of our annual goodwill impairment testing is the first day of the third fiscal quarter. In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill in 2022, we estimated the fair value of our reporting units. We relied on a number of factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units and evaluated various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows, including operating results, business plans and present value techniques. As discussed above under Trademarks and Other Identifiable Intangibles, there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors, and our judgment in applying them and the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future. Such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans For a discussion of our defined benefit pension plans and the related net periodic benefit cost, plan obligations, plan assets and how we measure the amount of these costs, see Note Defined Benefit Pension Plans to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The funded status of our defined benefit pension plans are recognized on our balance sheet. Differences between actual results in a given year and the actuarially determined assumed results for that year are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in comprehensive income. We measure the funded status of our plans as of the date of our fiscal year end. The net periodic benefit cost of the pension plans is determined using projections and actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and the long-term rate of asset return. The net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in the year incurred. Gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are amortized over the average future expected life of participants. As benefits under the Hanesbrands Inc. Pension Plan are frozen, year over year fluctuations in our pension expense are not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our policies regarding the establishment of pension assumptions are as follows: Discount rate assumptions are generally based on yield curves applicable to each country and the expected cash flows for each plan. For our U.S. defined benefit plans, we use the full series of spot rates along the Aon AA-Only Above Median Yield Curve and expected plan cash flows to determine liabilities and expense. Single equivalent discount rates are shown for disclosure purposes. Salary increase assumptions, where applicable, are generally based on historical experience and management expectations. This assumption is not applicable to the U.S., Italy or Canada SERP as benefits under these plans are either frozen or not tied to pay. The benefits under the Hanesbrands Inc. Legacy Pension Plan and the Hanesbrands Inc. Pension Plan were frozen as of December 31, 2005. Long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions, where applicable, are generally based on each plan investment mix and forward-looking capital market assumptions applicable to each country. Expected returns also reflect an incremental premium for actively managed investments and a reduction for trust-paid expenses. This assumption is not applicable to unfunded plans. Retirement and turnover assumptions are generally based on actual plan experience while standard actuarial mortality tables applicable to each country are used to estimate life expectancy. For our U.S. defined benefit plans, 45 Table of Contents the 2022 mortality tables are from the Society of Actuaries Private Plan study published in 2019 (Pri-2012) projected generationally with Scale MP-2021 and reflecting Aon Endemic scale adjustment, which increases the standard mortality rates in the near term due to the impact of the pandemic in the U.S., scaling down each year to a permanent slight increase to the standard mortality rates. The sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans benefit obligations, all other factors being equal, is illustrated by the following: Increase (Decrease) in Pension Expense Benefit Obligation (in millions) 1% decrease in discount rate $ (1) $ 95 1% increase in discount rate 0 (80) 1% decrease in expected investment return 8 N/A 1% increase in expected investment return (8) N/A Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements For a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
