ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis provides information we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition for 2015, 2014 and 2013. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and Part I, Item 1, Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following analysis contains forward-looking statements about our future revenues, operating results and expectations. See Special Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the risks, assumptions and uncertainties affecting these statements as well as Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. Overview We are a provider of high-quality, low-cost home health services to the chronic, co-morbid, aging American population, with approximately 80%, 82% and 84% of our revenue derived from Medicare for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our operations involve servicing patients through our two reportable business segments: home health and hospice. Our home health segment delivers a wide range of services in the homes of individuals who may be recovering from an illness, injury or surgery. Our hospice segment provides care that is designed to provide comfort and support for those who are facing a terminal illness. As of December 31, 2015, we owned and operated 329 Medicare-certified home health care centers and 79 Medicare-certified hospice care centers in 34 states within the United States and the District of Columbia, including 15 home health care centers acquired from Infinity HomeCare on December 31, 2015, which are not included in our operating results. 2015 Developments Discontinued AMS3, our third generation, proprietary operating system and transitioned to Homecare Homebase ( HCHB ), a leading platform for home health and hospice companies. Entered into new Credit Agreement that provides for senior secured facilities in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $300 million and terminated each of our Prior Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement. Operationalized the transition to the 10 th revision of the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD-10 ) Closed the acquisition of Infinity HomeCare on December 31, 2015 (Infinity HomeCare is not included in our operating results). 2016 Outlook Continue the rollout of HCHB with anticipated completion date in the second half of 2016. Renew focus on potential acquisitions. 1.4% reduction in Medicare reimbursement payments for home health industry. 1.1% increase in Medicare reimbursement payments for hospice industry. Transition to new hospice payment methodology Financial Performance The year ended December 31, 2015 continued our significant operational improvement that began during 2014. Our improvement began with the closure and/or consolidation of care centers that had a material, negative impact on our operating results. The reduction in the number of operating care centers enabled us to restructure our 33 Table of Contents regional and corporate support functions. Additionally, we have seen improvement in the remaining care centers in both of our operating segments with a return to home health same store Medicare admissions growth and a significant increase in hospice admissions and average daily census. Our home health care centers have experienced same store Medicare revenue and admissions growth. The home health segment has seen a significant increase in non-Medicare revenue, an increase in revenue per episode while maintaining a relatively flat cost per visit and reductions in operating expenses which have helped deliver a $29 million improvement in our operating results over the year ended December 31, 2014 (see Results of Operations ). Our hospice segment has shown consistent growth in admissions and average daily census combined with strong cost controls, all of which have helped deliver a $13 million improvement in our operating results over the year ended December 31, 2014 (see Results of Operations ). Owned and Operated Care Centers Home Health Hospice At December 31, 2012 435 97 Acquisitions/Startups 2 1 Closed/Consolidated (70 ) (6 ) At December 31, 2013 367 92 Closed/Consolidated/Sold (51 ) (12 ) At December 31, 2014 316 80 Acquisitions (1) 15 1 Closed/Consolidated/Sold (2 ) (2 ) At December 31, 2015 329 79 (1) The 15 home health care centers acquired from Infinity HomeCare on December 31, 2015 are not included in our operating results. When we refer to same store business, we mean home health and hospice care centers that we have operated for at least the last twelve months; when we refer to acquisitions, we mean home health and hospice care centers that we acquired within the last twelve months; and when we refer to start-ups, we mean home health or hospice care centers opened by us in the last twelve months. Once a care center has been in operation for a twelve month period, the results for that particular care center are included as part of our same store business from that date forward. Non-Medicare revenue, admissions, recertifications or completed episodes, includes home health revenue, admissions, recertifications or completed episodes of care for those payors that pay on an episodic or per visit basis, which includes Medicare Advantage programs and private payors. Economic and Industry Factors Home health and hospice services are a highly fragmented, highly competitive industry. The degree of competiveness varies depending upon whether our care centers operate in states that require a certificate of need (CON) or permit of approval (POA). In such states, expansion by existing providers or entry into the market by new providers is permitted only where determination is made by state health authorities that a given amount of unmet need exists. Currently, 67% and 40% of our home health and hospice care centers, respectively operate in CON/POA states. As the Federal government continues to debate a reduction in expenditures and a reform of the Medicare system, our industry continues to face reimbursement pressures. Specifically, the industry has been impacted by a 2% sequestration payment reduction beginning April 1, 2013. In addition to the sequestration cut, the Centers for 34 Table of Contents Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) instituted a rebasing cut of approximately $81 (2.7%) per year for 2014 2017; however, we do expect some offset from a market basket updated in each of these years. The following payment adjustments are effective for the years indicated based on CMS final rules relative to Medicare reimbursement: Home Health(1) Hospice 2016 2015 2014 2016(2) 2015 2014 Market Basket Update 2.3 % 2.6 % 2.3 % 2.4 % 2.9 % 2.5 % Rebasing (2.4 ) (2.8 ) (2.7 ) ICD-9 Coding Change (0.6 ) 50/50 Blend of Wage Index 0.2 Nominal Case Mix Adjustment (0.9 ) PPACA Adjustment (0.3 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) Budget Neutrality Adjustment Factor 0.4 (0.7 ) (0.7 ) (0.7 ) Productivity Adjustment (0.4 ) (0.5 ) (0.5 ) (0.5 ) (0.5 ) (1.4 )% (0.3 )% (1.0 )% 1.1 % 1.4 % 1.0 % (1) Our impact could differ depending on differences in the wage index and coding changes. (2) Effective for services provided from October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016. As part of the 2016 final rule issued in October 2015, CMS finalized their proposal to implement a Home Health Value-Based Purchasing model in nine states that seeks to test whether incentives for better care can improve outcomes in the delivery of home health services. Financial impacts from this change, either positive or negative, would begin January 1, 2018, applied to that calendar year based on 2015 performance data. Currently, care centers operating in the states included in the proposed model account for approximately 26% of our home health Medicare revenue. Governmental Inquiries and Investigations and Other Litigation September 2010 Civil Investigative Demand Issued by the U.S. Department of Justice On September 27, 2010, we received a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) issued by the U.S. Department of Justice pursuant to the federal False Claims Act. The CID required the delivery of a wide range of documents and information relating to the Company clinical and business operations, including reimbursement and billing claims submitted to Medicare for home health services, and related compliance activities. The CID generally covered the period from January 1, 2003. On April 26, 2011, we received a second CID related to the CID issued in September 2010, which generally covered the same time period as the previous CID and required the production of additional documents. Such CIDs are often associated with previously filed qui tam actions, or lawsuits filed under seal under the False Claims Act ( FCA ), 31 U.S.C. 3729 et seq. Qui tam actions are brought by private plaintiffs suing on behalf of the federal government for alleged FCA violations. Subsequently, the Company and certain current and former employees received additional CIDs for additional documents and/or testimony. In May 2012, we made a disclosure to CMS under the agency Stark Law Self-Referral Disclosure Protocol relating to certain services agreements between a subsidiary of ours and a large physician group (the Stark Law Self-Referral Matter ). During some period of time since December 2007, the arrangements appear not to have complied in certain respects with an applicable exemption to the Stark Law referral prohibition. Medicare revenue earned as a result of referrals from the physician group from May 2008 to May 2012, the relevant four year lookback period under the Stark Law Self-Referral Disclosure Protocol, was approximately $4 million. On January 11, 2013, one of our subsidiaries received a CID from the United States Attorney Office for the Northern District of Georgia seeking certain information relating to that subsidiary relationship with this physician group 35 Table of Contents On April 23, 2014, with no admission of liability on our part, we entered into a settlement agreement to resolve both the U.S. Department of Justice investigation and the Stark Law Self-Referral Matter. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, on May 2, 2014, we paid the United States an initial payment in the amount of $116.5 million representing the first installment of $115 million plus interest thereon due under the settlement agreement, and on October 23, 2014, we paid the United States an additional payment in the amount of $35.8 million, representing the second and final installment of $35 million plus interest thereon due under the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement also resolves allegations made against us by various qui tam relators, who are required to dismiss their claims with prejudice. We accrued and paid various relators attorneys fees and expenses in the aggregate sum of approximately $3.9 million during 2014. In connection with the settlement agreement, on April 23, 2014, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement ( CIA ) with the Office of Inspector General-HHS ( OIG ). The CIA formalizes various aspects of our already existing ethics and compliance programs and contains other requirements designed to help ensure our ongoing compliance with federal health care program requirements. Among other things, the CIA requires us to maintain our existing compliance program, executive compliance committee and compliance committee of the Board of Directors; provide certain compliance training; continue screening new and current employees to ensure they are eligible to participate in federal health care programs; engage an independent review organization to perform certain auditing and reviews and prepare certain reports regarding our compliance with federal health care programs, our billing submissions to federal health care programs and our compliance and risk mitigation programs; and provide certain reports and management certifications to the OIG. Additionally, the CIA specifically requires that we report substantial overpayments that we discover we have received from federal health care programs, as well as probable violations of federal health care laws. Upon breach of the CIA, we could become liable for payment of certain stipulated penalties, or could be excluded from participation in federal health care programs. The CIA has a term of five years. We expect the CIA to impact operating expenses by approximately $1 to $2 million annually. May 2015 Subpoena Duces Tecum Issued by the U.S. Department of Justice On May 21, 2015, we received a Subpoena Duces Tecum ( Subpoena ) issued by the U.S. Department of Justice. The Subpoena requests the delivery of information regarding 53 identified hospice patients to the United States Attorney Office for the District of Massachusetts. It also requests the delivery of documents relating to our hospice clinical and business operations and related compliance activities. November 2015 Civil Investigative Demand Issued by the U.S. Department of Justice On November 3, 2015, we received a CID issued by the U.S. Department of Justice pursuant to the federal False Claims Act relating to claims submitted to Medicare and/or Medicaid for hospice services provided through designated facilities in the Morgantown, West Virginia area. See Item 8, Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our April 2014 CIA, the May 2015 Subpoena issued by the U.S. Department of Justice, the November 2015 CID issued by the U.S. Department of Justice and for a discussion of and updates regarding class action litigation we are involved in. No assurances can be given as to the timing or outcome of these items. 36 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated The following table summarizes our results from continuing operations (amounts in millions): For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Net service revenue $ 1,280.5 $ 1,204.5 $ 1,249.3 Gross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization 554.6 513.4 531.3 % of revenue 43.3 % 42.6 % 42.5 % Other operating expenses 486.5 486.3 526.8 % of revenue 38.0 % 40.4 % 42.2 % U.S. Department of Justice settlement 150.0 Asset impairment charge 77.3 3.1 9.5 Operating (loss) income (9.2 ) 24.0 (155.0 ) Total other income (expense), net 8.9 (3.1 ) 1.5 Income tax (expense) benefit (2.0 ) (7.7 ) 58.8 Effective income tax rate 650.6 % 36.6 % (38.3 %) (Loss) income from continuing operations (2.3 ) 13.3 (94.7 ) Net loss from discontinued operations (0.2 ) (3.1 ) Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.7 ) (0.3 ) 1.6 Net (loss) income attributable to Amedisys, Inc. $ (3.0 ) $ 12.8 $ (96.2 ) Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Our 2015 results were impacted by a $75 million non-cash charge to write off the software costs incurred related to the development of AMS3 Home Health and Hospice and a $2 million non-cash charge to reduce the carrying value of our corporate headquarters. During the first quarter of 2014, we committed to a plan to consolidate 21 operating home health care centers and four operating hospice care centers with care centers servicing the same markets and close 23 home health care centers and six hospice care centers. As a result of this exit activity, we reduced our regional leadership structure and corporate support functions. Separate from the restructuring costs, we also recorded severance costs associated with the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer, a charge for relator fees associated with our U.S. Department of Justice settlement during the first quarter of 2014 and a non-cash other intangibles impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2014. The following details the costs associated with these activities (amounts in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Home Health Hospice Corporate Total Severance(a) $ 2.0 $ 0.1 $ $ 2.1 Restructuring severance 2.1 0.6 3.0 5.7 Lease terminations 1.9 0.2 2.1 Other intangibles impairment 1.6 1.5 3.1 Exit and restructuring activities cost 7.6 2.4 3.0 13.0 U.S. Department of Justice Settlement/Relator Fees 3.9 3.9 Total $ 7.6 $ 2.4 $ 6.9 $ 16.9 (a) Includes $0.8 million and $0.1 million for severance included in cost of service for home health and hospice, respectively. 37 Table of Contents Our operating results have been impacted by the sale, closure and consolidation of numerous care centers as mentioned above. Accordingly, our results for the year ended December 31, 2015 are not fully comparable to the year ended December 31, 2014. Our operating income, excluding the $77 million asset impairment charges in 2015 and the $17 million in costs incurred in 2014 noted above, increased $27 million as our home health operating income increased $29 million, our hospice operating income increased $13 million and our corporate operating expense increased $15 million. The primary drivers of our improvement in performance were the closure/consolidation of care centers that had a negative operating contribution, an increase in our revenue per episode, an increase in non-Medicare revenue, growth in hospice census and a reduction in operating expenses. The increase in corporate operating expenses is primarily due to the $6 million Wage and Hour Litigation settlement accrual and HCHB maintenance and hosting and implementation costs of $8 million. The increase in HCHB maintenance and hosting is offset by a $4 million decrease in depreciation and amortization as we move from our proprietary software to HCHB. Total other income (expense), net decreased $1 million from prior year after considering the impact of the following items (amounts in millions): For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Legal settlements $ 7.4 $ 1.1 Equity in earnings from equity method investment 6.7 Life insurance proceeds 1.0 Debt refinance costs (3.2 ) (0.5 ) Gain (loss) on disposal of property and equipment or sale of care centers 0.2 0.7 $ 12.1 $ 1.3 The difference in income tax expense in 2015 and 2014 is driven primarily by the decrease in income before income taxes. Additionally, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 does not provide a meaningful comparison to other periods. The effective tax rate for the year is influenced by the relationship of the amount of effective tax rate drivers (i.e. non-deductible expenses, non-taxable income, tax credits, valuation allowance, uncertain tax positions, etc.) to (loss) income before income taxes. A significant asset impairment was recorded during the three-month period ended March 31, 2015, resulting in a scenario where the company (loss) income before income taxes for 2015 was near zero. Consequently, for 2015, the relationship between the effective tax rate drivers and (loss) income before income taxes is distorted. Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Our operating results have been impacted by the sale, closure and consolidation of 54 care centers mentioned above as well as the closure of an additional 9 care centers since December 31, 2013. Additionally, 76 care centers were exited during 2013. Accordingly, our results for the year ended December 31, 2014 are not fully comparable to the year ended December 31, 2013. Our 2013 results were impacted by an accrual of $150 million and recognition of a deferred tax benefit of $56 million for the settlement to resolve both the U.S. Department of Justice investigation and the Stark Law Self-Referral Matter. In addition, we recorded asset impairment charges of $9 million related to other intangibles during 2013. Our operating income, excluding the $17 million in costs incurred in 2014 noted above and the U.S. Department of Justice settlement and the asset impairment charge in 2013, increased $36 million as our home health operating income increased $27 million, our hospice operating income increased $5 million and corporate 38 Table of Contents expenses decreased $4 million. Additionally, the first quarter of 2013 was not impacted by sequestration as it was not in effect until April 1, 2013. The estimated impact of sequestration was $21 million for 2014 compared to $18 million in 2013. Income tax expense for 2014 and 2013 includes a favorable adjustment of $2 million related to various tax credits for state employment and training and state and federal research development. Home Health Division The following table summarizes our home health segment results from continuing operations: For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Financial Information (in millions) : Medicare $ 761.4 $ 751.5 $ 803.8 Non-Medicare 243.7 205.4 183.9 Net service revenue 1,005.1 956.9 987.7 Cost of service 584.2 559.4 578.9 Gross margin 420.9 397.5 408.8 Other operating expenses 280.6 294.4 333.8 Operating income $ 140.3 $ 103.1 $ 75.0 Key Statistical Data: Medicare: Same Store Volume (1): Revenue 3 % 1 % (10 %) Admissions 3 % 0 % 0 % Recertifications (1 %) 1 % (18 %) Total (2): Admissions 178,226 177,243 190,507 Recertifications 99,762 102,263 107,908 Completed episodes 269,227 272,864 292,984 Visits 4,797,734 4,794,609 5,177,976 Average revenue per episode (3) $ 2,825 $ 2,768 $ 2,758 Visits per completed episode (4) 17.5 17.3 17.5 Non-Medicare: Same Store Volume (1): Revenue 21 % 19 % (20 %) Admissions 18 % 17 % (13 %) Recertifications 14 % 13 % (24 %) Total (2): Admissions 96,934 83,940 76,669 Recertifications 35,870 32,074 30,304 Visits 1,954,543 1,651,745 1,531,781 Total (2): Cost per Visit $ 86.52 $ 86.77 $ 86.27 Visits 6,752,277 6,446,354 6,709,757 (1) Same store Medicare and Non-Medicare revenue, admissions or recertifications growth is the percent increase (decrease) in our Medicare and Non-Medicare revenue, admissions or recertifications for the period as a percent of the Medicare and Non-Medicare revenue, admissions or recertifications of the prior period. (2) Based on continuing operations for all periods presented. 39 Table of Contents (3) Average Medicare revenue per completed episode is the average Medicare revenue earned for each Medicare completed episode of care which includes the impact of sequestration. (4) Medicare visits per completed episode are the home health Medicare visits on completed episodes divided by the home health Medicare episodes completed during the period. Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Overall, our operating income excluding the $8 million in exit activity costs in 2014, increased $29 million on a $22 million increase in gross margin and a $7 million decline in other operating expenses. 2014 results included revenue of $16 million and operating losses of $5 million for those care centers that were closed, consolidated or sold. Net Service Revenue Our Medicare revenue increase of approximately $10 million consisted of a $16 million increase due to higher revenue per episode offset by $6 million due to lower volumes. The decrease in volumes is primarily due to the sale, closure and consolidation of 51 care centers since December 31, 2013, as we experienced a 3% increase in same store admissions in 2015. Net service revenue includes a reduction of $1 million for the estimated impact of the 2016 rate change. The impact for 2016 is estimated to be approximately $14 million. Our non-Medicare revenue increased $38 million as we have focused on contracted payors with significant concentrations in our markets and those that add incremental margin to our operations. As mentioned above, we have closed numerous care centers since December 31, 2013. Accordingly, our results are not fully comparable to prior year. The following table summarizes our net service revenue for our operating care centers and those care centers that were closed, consolidated or sold. For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Revenue (in millions) : Operating care centers $ 1,005.1 $ 941.2 $ 895.6 Closed/Consolidated/Sold care centers 15.7 92.1 Net service revenue 1,005.1 956.9 987.7 Cost of Service, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization Our cost of service, excluding the $1 million in exit activity costs in 2014, increased $26 million primarily as a result of a 5% increase in visits. Our cost per visit remained relatively flat. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses, excluding the $7 million in exit activity costs in 2014, decreased $7 million due to decreases in other care center related expenses as a result of our closure and consolidation strategy and the reduction in divisional leadership; the majority of the reductions were in salaries and benefits and rent expense, offset by $5 million increase in legal expense related to the self-disclosure matter. In addition, our provision for doubtful accounts decreased $3 million and our depreciation and amortization expense decreased $4 million compared to 2014. Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Overall, our operating income, excluding the $8 million in exit activity costs in 2014 and the $8 million asset impairment charge in 2013, increased $27 million on an $11 million decline in gross margin offset by a $38 million decline in other operating expenses. 40 Table of Contents Net Service Revenue Our Medicare revenue decline of approximately $52 million consisted of $53 million due to lower volumes and $2 million due to sequestration offset by a $3 million increase related to revenue per episode. The decrease in volumes is primarily due to the sale, closure and consolidation of 51 care centers since December 31, 2013, as we experienced an increase in same store revenue and recertifications. Our non-Medicare revenue increased $21 million which is primarily due to increases in volumes and an increase in our revenue per visit. We are experiencing significant growth in our non-Medicare business as we have focused on contract payors with significant concentrations in our markets. Cost of Service, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization Our cost of service, excluding the $1 million in exit activity costs in 2014, decreased $20 million primarily as a result of our decrease in Medicare volumes which was offset by an 8% increase in non-Medicare visits as our cost per visit remained relatively flat. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses, excluding the $7 million in exit activity costs in 2014 and the $8 million asset impairment charge in 2013, decreased $38 million due to a $43 million decrease in other care center related expenses as a result of our closure and consolidation strategy and the reduction in divisional leadership; the majority of the reductions were in salaries and benefits, rent expense and travel costs offset by a $5 million increase in our provision for doubtful accounts due to the increase in non-Medicare revenue. Hospice Division The following table summarizes our hospice segment results from continuing operations: For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Financial Information (in millions): Medicare $ 258.5 $ 232.6 $ 246.4 Non-Medicare 16.9 15.0 15.2 Net service revenue 275.4 247.6 261.6 Cost of service 141.7 131.7 139.1 Gross margin 133.7 115.9 122.5 Other operating expenses 66.0 63.4 73.5 Operating income $ 67.7 $ 52.5 $ 49.0 Key Statistical Data: Same Store Volume (1): Medicare revenue 13 % (2 %) (9 %) Non-Medicare revenue 18 % 6 % (3 %) Hospice admits 16 % (3 %) (3 %) Average daily census 12 % (4 %) (8 %) Total (2): Hospice admits 19,205 17,081 18,335 Average daily census 5,105 4,632 4,987 Revenue per day $ 147.78 $ 146.51 $ 143.77 Cost of service per day $ 76.06 $ 77.93 $ 76.45 Discharge average length of stay 92 100 100 41 Table of Contents (1) Same store Medicare and Non-Medicare revenue, Hospice admits or average daily census volume is the percent increase (decrease) in our Medicare and Non-Medicare revenue, Hospice admits or average daily census for the period as a percent of the Medicare and Non-Medicare revenue, Hospice admits or average daily census of the prior period. (2) Based on continuing operations for all periods presented. Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Overall, our operating income, excluding the $2 million in exit activity costs in 2014, increased $13 million on an $18 million increase in gross margin offset by a $5 million increase in other operating expenses. Net Service Revenue Our hospice revenue increased $28 million, primarily as the result of an increase in our average daily census as a result of a 16% increase in hospice admissions. We benefitted from a 1.4% hospice rate increase effective October 1, 2014. The base rate for hospice services provided from October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016 will increase 1.1% as a result of the final rule issued by CMS in August 2015. As mentioned above, we have closed numerous care centers since December 31, 2013. Accordingly, our results are not fully comparable to prior year. The following table summarizes our net service revenue for our operating care centers and those care centers that were closed, consolidated or sold. For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Revenue (in millions) : Operating care centers $ 275.4 $ 243.4 $ 243.7 Closed/Consolidated/Sold care centers 4.2 17.9 Net service revenue 275.4 247.6 261.6 Cost of Service, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization Our hospice cost of service increased $10 million as the result of a 10% increase in average daily census offset by a decrease in cost of service per day. We experienced significant improvement in pharmacy and DME cost per day during 2015. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses, excluding the $2 million in exit activity costs in 2014, increased $5 million due to increases in other care center related expenses, primarily salaries and benefits expense and travel costs. Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Overall, our operating income, excluding the $2 million in exit activity costs in 2014 and the $1 million impairment charge in 2013, increased $5 million on a $14 million decline in revenue, an $8 million decline in cost of service and an $11 million decline in other operating expenses. Net Service Revenue Our hospice revenue decreased $14 million, primarily as the result of a decrease in our average daily census. The decrease in average daily census is primarily due to the sale, closure and consolidation of 12 care centers since 42 Table of Contents December 31, 2013. The decrease in revenue was offset by a $2 million decrease in our hospice cap expense as our decline in average daily census and a decrease in admissions has resulted in a decrease in our overall cap expense. We benefitted from a 1.0% hospice rate increase effective October 1, 2013, and beginning October 1, 2014, the fiscal year 2015 hospice base rate increased approximately 1.4%. Cost of Service, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization Our hospice cost of service decreased $8 million, or 5%, as the result of a 7% decrease in average daily census offset by an increase in cost of service per day. Our cost of service per day has been negatively impacted by an increase in pharmacy costs as a result of new CMS guidance which became effective on May 1, 2014. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses, excluding the $2 million in exit activity costs in 2014 and the $1 million impairment charge in 2013, decreased $11 million due to a $7 million decrease in other care center related expenses due to our care center closure and consolidation strategy and a $4 million decrease in our provision for doubtful accounts. Corporate The following table summarizes our corporate results from continuing operations: For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Financial Information (in millions): Other operating expenses $ 126.5 $ 114.4 $ 104.5 Depreciation and amortization 13.4 17.2 24.5 Total before impairment and U.S. Department of Justice settlement (1) $ 139.9 $ 131.6 $ 129.0 (1) Total of $217.2 million on a GAAP basis for the year ended December 31, 2015 (including $77.3 million asset impairment charge). Total of $279.0 million on a GAAP basis for the year ended December 31, 2013 (including $150.0 U.S. Department of Justice settlement). Corporate expenses consist of cost relating to our executive management and administrative support functions, primarily information services, accounting, finance, billing and collections, legal, compliance, risk management, procurement, marketing, clinical administration, training, human resources and administration. Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Excluding the $77 million asset impairment charge in 2015 and the $7 million in exit and restructuring activities costs and relator fees associated with our U.S. Department of Justice settlement agreement during 2014, corporate other operating expenses increased $15 million which is inclusive of the $6 million Wage and Hour Litigation settlement accrual, $4 million in HCHB maintenance and hosting costs, $4 million related to HCHB implementation and $2 million in severance costs. Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Excluding the 2014 exit and restructuring activities costs and relator fees associated with our U.S. Department of Justice settlement agreement and the U.S. Department of Justice settlement in 2013, corporate expenses 43 Table of Contents decreased $4 million primarily due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization. Our corporate salaries and wages experienced an increase due to the addition of resources for the roll-out of AMS3, our enhanced point of care system. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (amounts in millions): For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 107.8 $ (65.5 ) $ 102.3 Cash used in investing activities (67.4 ) (14.3 ) (46.5 ) Cash (used in) provided by financing activities (20.9 ) 70.5 (53.0 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 19.5 (9.3 ) 2.8 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 8.0 17.3 14.5 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 27.5 $ 8.0 $ 17.3 Cash provided by operating activities increased $173.3 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in our operating performance as compared to 2014 and the payment of $150.0 million in 2014 under our settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. For additional information regarding our operating performance, see Results of Operations . The recognition of the asset impairment charge of $77.3 million, which resulted in the net loss for 2015 is a non-cash item and therefore has no impact on our cash flow from operations. Cash used in operating activities increased $167.8 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the payment of the U.S. Department of Justice Settlement. Adjusting for the $152.3 million settlement and interest payment, we generated $86.8 million in cash from operating activities during 2014. Cash used in investing activities increased $53.1 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to our acquisition activity ($69.1 million) and an increase in capital expenditures ($9.4 million), offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment ($20.0 million) and investments ($5.0 million). Cash used in investing activities decreased $32.2 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures of $29.7 million, primarily related to AMS3 development, and a $3.7 million decrease in the purchase of investments. Cash used in financing activities increased $91.4 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in our principal payments of long-term obligations, net of borrowings. We decreased our outstanding long-term obligations, net of borrowings by $16.4 million from December 31, 2014. Cash provided by financing activities increased $123.5 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in our borrowings on our revolving line of credit and our Second Lien Loan. We increased our outstanding long-term obligations, net of repayments by $71.1 million from December 31, 2013, primarily to fund the U.S. Department of Justice settlement payment. Liquidity Typically, our principal source of liquidity is the collection of our patient accounts receivable, primarily through the Medicare program. In addition to our collection of patient accounts receivable, from time to time, we can and do obtain additional sources of liquidity by the incurrence of additional indebtedness. During 2015, we spent $9.3 million in routine capital expenditures compared to $7.0 million and $6.5 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively. Routine capital expenditures primarily include equipment and computer 44 Table of Contents software and hardware. In addition, we spent $12.1 million in non-routine capital expenditures related to software licenses and interfaces compared to $5.0 million and $35.2 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to enhancements to our point of care software. Our routine and non-routine capital expenditures for 2016 are expected to be approximately $9.1 million and $13.3 million, respectively. On April 23, 2014, we entered into a settlement agreement to resolve both the U.S. Department of Justice investigation and the Stark Law Self-Referral Matter. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, on May 2, 2014, we paid the United States an initial payment in the amount of $116.5 million, representing the first installment of $115 million plus interest thereon due under the settlement agreement, and on October 23, 2014, we paid the United States an additional payment in the amount of $35.8 million, representing the second and final installment of $35 million plus interest thereon due under the settlement agreement. On August 28, 2015, we entered into a Credit Agreement that provides for senior secured facilities in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $300 million comprised of (a) a term loan facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of $100 million and (b) a revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $200 million. The net proceeds of the term loan and existing cash on hand were used to pay off (i) our existing term loan under our prior Credit Agreement dated as of October 22, 2012, as amended with a principal balance of $27 million and (ii) our existing term loan under our prior Second Lien Credit Agreement dated July 28, 2014, with a principal balance of $70 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had $27.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $179.0 million in availability under our $200.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Based on our operating forecasts and our new debt service requirements, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, capital requirements and debt service requirements. Outstanding Patient Accounts Receivable Our patient accounts receivable, net increased $25.7 million from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. Our cash collection as a percentage of revenue was 100% and 103% for December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our days revenue outstanding, net at December 31, 2015 was 31.9 days which is an increase of 2.5 days from December 31, 2014. Our days revenue outstanding, net at December 31, 2015 does not include Infinity HomeCare. Our patient accounts receivable includes unbilled receivables and are aged based upon our initial service date. We monitor unbilled receivables on a care center by care center basis to ensure that all efforts are made to bill claims within timely filing deadlines. Our unbilled patient accounts receivable can be impacted by acquisition activity, probe edits or regulatory changes which result in additional information or procedures needed prior to billing. The timely filing deadline for Medicare is one year from the date the episode was completed and varies by state for Medicaid-reimbursable services and among insurance companies and other private payors. Our provision for estimated revenue adjustments (which is deducted from our service revenue to determine net service revenue) and provision for doubtful accounts were as follows for the periods indicated (amounts in millions). We fully reserve for both our Medicare and other patient accounts receivable that are aged over 365 days. For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Provision for estimated revenue adjustments (1) $ 6.1 $ 5.1 Provision for doubtful accounts (2) 14.1 16.4 Total $ 20.2 $ 21.5 As a percent of revenue 1.6 % 1.8 % (1) Includes $0.1 million from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. 45 Table of Contents (2) Includes $0.1 million from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. The following schedules detail our patient accounts receivable, net of estimated revenue adjustments, by payor class, aged based upon initial date of service (amounts in millions, except days revenue outstanding, net): 0-90 91-180 181-365 Over 365 Total At December 31, 2015: Medicare patient accounts receivable, net (1) $ 73.5 $ 7.0 $ (0.4 ) $ $ 80.1 Other patient accounts receivable: Medicaid 12.4 1.7 0.9 15.0 Private 31.2 8.1 5.1 2.0 46.4 Total $ 43.6 $ 9.8 $ 6.0 $ 2.0 $ 61.4 Allowance for doubtful accounts (2) (16.5 ) Non-Medicare patient accounts receivable, net $ 44.9 Total patient accounts receivable, net $ 125.0 Days revenue outstanding, net (3) 31.9 0-90 91-180 181-365 Over 365 Total At December 31, 2014: Medicare patient accounts receivable, net (1) $ 62.1 $ 6.3 $ $ $ 68.4 Other patient accounts receivable: Medicaid 9.1 1.4 0.7 0.4 11.6 Private 23.4 5.4 2.5 2.3 33.6 Total $ 32.5 $ 6.8 $ 3.2 $ 2.7 $ 45.2 Allowance for doubtful accounts (2) (14.3 ) Non-Medicare patient accounts receivable, net $ 30.9 Total patient accounts receivable, net $ 99.3 Days revenue outstanding, net (3) 29.4 (1) The following table summarizes the activity and ending balances in our estimated revenue adjustments (amounts in millions), which is recorded to reduce our Medicare outstanding patient accounts receivable to their estimated net realizable value, as we do not estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts for our Medicare claims. For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Balance at beginning of period $ 3.1 $ 3.9 Provision for estimated revenue adjustments (a) 6.1 5.1 Write offs (5.2 ) (5.9 ) Balance at end of period $ 4.0 $ 3.1 (a) Includes $0.1 million from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our estimated revenue adjustments were 4.8% and 4.3% of our outstanding Medicare patient accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. 46 Table of Contents (2) The following table summarizes the activity and ending balances in our allowance for doubtful accounts (amounts in millions), which is recorded to reduce only our Medicaid and private payer outstanding patient accounts receivable to their estimated net realizable value. For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Balance at beginning of period $ 14.3 $ 14.2 Provision for doubtful accounts (a) 14.1 16.4 Write offs (11.9 ) (16.3 ) Balance at end of period $ 16.5 $ 14.3 (a) Includes $0.1 million from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was 26.9% and 31.6% of our outstanding Medicaid and private patient accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. (3) Our calculation of days revenue outstanding, net is derived by dividing our ending net patient accounts receivable (i.e., net of estimated revenue adjustments and allowance for doubtful accounts ) at December 31, 2015 and 2014 by our average daily net patient revenue for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Indebtedness Credit Agreement On August 28, 2015, we entered into a Credit Agreement that provides for senior secured facilities in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $300 million. The Credit Facilities are comprised of (a) a term loan facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of $100 million (the Term Loan ); and (b) a revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $200 million (the Revolving Credit Facility ). The Revolving Credit Facility provides for and includes within its $200 million limit a $25 million swingline facility and commitments for up to $50 million in letters of credit. Upon lender approval, we may increase the aggregate loan amount under the Credit Facilities by a maximum amount of $150 million. The net proceeds of the Term Loan and existing cash on hand were used to pay off (i) our existing term loan under our Prior Credit Agreement, dated as of October 22, 2012, as amended (the Prior Credit Agreement ) with a principal balance of $27 million and (ii) our existing term loan under our prior Second Lien Credit Agreement dated July 28, 2014 (the Second Lien Credit Agreement ), with a principal balance of $70 million. The final maturity of the Term Loan is August 28, 2020. The Term Loan will amortize beginning on March 31, 2016 in 18 quarterly installments (eight quarterly installments of $1.25 million followed by eight quarterly installments of $2.5 million, followed by two quarterly installments of $3.1 million, subject to adjustment for prepayments), with the remaining balance due upon maturity. The Revolving Credit Facility may be used to provide ongoing working capital and for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries, including permitted acquisitions, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The final maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility is August 28, 2020 and will be payable in full at that time. The interest rate in connection with the Credit Facilities shall be selected from the following by us: (i) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate or (ii) the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Rate. The Base Rate means a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum, (b) the prime 47 Table of Contents rate of interest established by the Administrative Agent, and (c) the Eurodollar Rate for an interest period of one month plus 1% per annum. The Eurodollar Rate means the rate at which Eurodollar deposits in the London interbank market for an interest period of one, two, three or six months (as selected by us) are quoted. The Applicable Rate is based on the consolidated leverage ratio and is presented in the table below. As of December 31, 2015, the Applicable Rate is 1.00% per annum for Base Rate Loans and 2.00% per annum for Eurodollar Rate Loans. We are also subject to a commitment fee and letter of credit fee under the terms of the Credit Facilities, as presented in the table below. Consolidated Leverage Ratio Margin for ABR Loans Margin for Eurodollar Loans Commitment Fee Letter of Credit Fee 2.75 to 1.0 2.00 % 3.00 % 0.40 % 3.00 % < 2.75 to 1.0 but 1.75 to 1.0 1.50 % 2.50 % 0.35 % 2.50 % < 1.75 to 1.0 but 0.75 to 1.0 1.00 % 2.00 % 0.30 % 2.00 % < 0.75 to 1.0 0.50 % 1.50 % 0.25 % 1.50 % Our weighted average interest rate for our $100.0 million Term Loan, under our Credit Agreement, was 2.7% for the period August 28, 2015 to December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, our availability under our $200.0 million Revolving Credit Facility was $179.0 million as we had $21.0 million outstanding in letters of credit. The Credit Agreement requires maintenance of two financial covenants: (i) a consolidated leverage ratio of funded indebtedness to EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, and (ii) a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of EBITDA plus rent expense (less cash taxes less capital expenditures) to scheduled debt repayments plus interest expense plus rent expense, all as defined in the Credit Agreement. Each of these covenants is calculated over rolling four-quarter periods and also is subject to certain exceptions and baskets. As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated leverage ratio was 0.9 and our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.7 and we are in compliance with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also contains customary covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on: incurrence of liens; incurrence of additional debt; sales of assets and other fundamental corporate changes; investments; and declarations of dividends. These covenants contain customary exclusions and baskets. The Credit Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement requires at all times that we (i) provide guaranties from wholly-owned subsidiaries that in the aggregate represent not less than 95% of our consolidated net revenues and adjusted EBITDA from all wholly-owned subsidiaries and (ii) provide guarantees from subsidiaries that in the aggregate represent not less than 70% of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, subject to certain exceptions. In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, we entered into (i) a Security Agreement with the Administrative Agent dated August 28, 2015 and (ii) a Pledge Agreement with the Administrative Agent dated as of August 28, 2015 for the purpose of securing the payment of our obligations under the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, as of the effective date of the Credit Agreement, our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by (i) the grant of a first lien security interest in the non-real estate assets of substantially all of our direct and indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries (subject to exceptions) and (ii) the pledge of the equity interests in (a) substantially all of our direct and indirect, wholly-owned corporate, limited liability company and limited partnership subsidiaries and (b) those joint ventures which constitute subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement (subject, in the case of the Pledge Agreement, to exceptions). In connection with the entry into the Credit Agreement, on August 28, 2015, each of the Prior Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Agreement were terminated. The Company paid a call premium of $700,000 associated with the termination of the Second Lien Credit Agreement and the voluntary prepayment of the amounts owed thereunder as of August 28, 2015, and expensed $2.5 million in deferred debt issuance costs 48 Table of Contents during the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. Also in connection with our entry into the Credit Agreement, we recorded $2.4 million in deferred debt issuance costs as other assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Stock Repurchase Program On September 9, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $75 million of our outstanding common stock on or before September 6, 2016. Under the terms of the program, we may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions, block purchases or in private transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws and other legal requirements. We may enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to effect some or all of the repurchases. The timing and the amount of the repurchases, if any, will be determined by management based on a number of factors, including but not limited to share price, trading volume and general market conditions, as well as on working capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors. During 2015, pursuant to this program, we repurchased 116,859 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $39.20 per share and a total cost of approximately $4.6 million. The repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares. Contractual Obligations and Medicare Liabilities Our future contractual obligations and Medicare liabilities at December 31, 2015 were as follows (amounts in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 Years Long-term obligations $ 100.0 $ 5.0 $ 15.0 $ 80.0 $ Interest on long-term obligations (1) 9.6 2.4 4.3 2.9 Operating leases 67.9 23.5 27.2 11.7 5.5 Capital commitments 3.1 3.1 Purchase obligations 30.5 9.3 17.2 4.0 Uncertain tax positions 4.7 0.6 4.1 $ 215.8 $ 43.9 $ 67.8 $ 98.6 $ 5.5 (1) Interest on debt with variable rates was calculated using the current rate of that particular debt instrument at December 31, 2015. Critical Accounting Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, collectability of accounts receivable, reserves related to insurance and litigation, goodwill, intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies. We base these estimates on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results experienced may vary materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations may be affected. 49 Table of Contents We believe the following critical accounting policies represent our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition We earn net service revenue through our home health and hospice care centers by providing a variety of services almost exclusively in the homes of our patients. This net service revenue is earned and billed either on an episode of care basis, on a per visit basis or on a daily basis depending upon the payment terms and conditions established with each payor for services provided. We refer to home health revenue earned and billed on a 60-day episode of care as episodic-based revenue. When we record our service revenue, we record it net of estimated revenue adjustments and contractual adjustments to reflect amounts we estimate to be realizable for services provided, as discussed below. We believe, based on information currently available to us and based on our judgment, that changes to one or more factors that impact the accounting estimates (such as our estimates related to revenue adjustments, contractual adjustments and episodes in progress) we make in determining net service revenue, which changes are likely to occur from period to period, will not materially impact our reported consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or our future financial results. Home Health Revenue Recognition Medicare Revenue Net service revenue is recorded under the Medicare prospective payment system ( PPS ) based on a 60-day episode payment rate that is subject to adjustment based on certain variables. We make adjustments to Medicare revenue on completed episodes to reflect differences between estimated and actual payment amounts, and our discovered inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations and other reasons unrelated to credit risk. We estimate the impact of such adjustments based on our historical experience, which primarily includes a historical collection rate of over 99% on Medicare claims, and record this estimate during the period in which services are rendered as an estimated revenue adjustment and a corresponding reduction to patient accounts receivable. In addition, management evaluates the potential for revenue adjustments and, when appropriate, provides allowances based upon the best available information. In addition to revenue recognized on completed episodes, we also recognize a portion of revenue associated with episodes in progress. Episodes in progress are 60-day episodes of care that begin during the reporting period, but were not completed as of the end of the period. We estimate this revenue on a monthly basis based upon historical trends. The primary factors underlying this estimate are the number of episodes in progress at the end of the reporting period, expected Medicare revenue per episode and our estimate of the average percentage complete based on visits performed. Non-Medicare Revenue Episodic-based Revenue. We recognize revenue in a similar manner as we recognize Medicare revenue for episodic-based rates that are paid by other insurance carriers, including Medicare Advantage programs; however, these rates can vary based upon the negotiated terms. Non-episodic Based Revenue. Gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established or estimated per-visit rates, as applicable. Contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between our standard rates and the contracted rates to be realized from patients, third parties and others for services provided and are deducted from gross revenue to determine net service revenue and are also recorded as a reduction to our outstanding patient accounts receivable. In addition, we receive a minimal amount of our net service revenue from patients who are either self-insured or are obligated for an insurance co-payment. 50 Table of Contents Hospice Revenue Recognition Hospice Medicare Revenue Gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to the estimated payment rates. The estimated payment rates are daily or hourly rates for each of the four levels of care we deliver. We make adjustments to Medicare revenue for our discovered inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations and other reasons unrelated to credit risk. We estimate the impact of these adjustments based on our historical experience, which primarily includes our historical collection rate on Medicare claims, and record it during the period services are rendered as an estimated revenue adjustment and as a reduction to our outstanding patient accounts receivable. Additionally, as Medicare hospice revenue is subject to an inpatient cap limit and an overall payment cap for each provider number, we monitor these caps and estimate amounts due back to Medicare if a cap has been exceeded. We record these adjustments as a reduction to revenue and an increase in other accrued liabilities. Beginning for the cap year ending October 31, 2014, providers are required to self-report and pay their estimated cap liability by March 31 st of the following year. As of December 31, 2015, we have settled our Medicare hospice reimbursements for all fiscal years through October 31, 2012 and we have recorded $1.4 million for estimated amounts due back to Medicare in other accrued liabilities for the Federal cap years ended October 31, 2013 through October 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2014, we had recorded $2.8 million for estimated amounts due back to Medicare in other accrued liabilities for the Federal cap years ended October 31, 2013 through October 31, 2015. Hospice Non-Medicare Revenue We record gross revenue on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established rates or estimated per visit rates, as applicable. Contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between our established rates and the amounts estimated to be realizable from patients, third parties and others for services provided and are deducted from gross revenue to determine our net service revenue and patient accounts receivable. Patient Accounts Receivable Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Our patient accounts receivable are uncollateralized and consist of amounts due from Medicare, Medicaid, other third-party payors and patients. We fully reserve for accounts which are aged at 365 days or greater. We write off accounts on a monthly basis once we have exhausted our collection efforts and deem an account to be uncollectible. We do not record an allowance for doubtful accounts for our Medicare patient accounts receivable, which are recorded at their net realizable value after recording estimated revenue adjustments as discussed above. We believe there is a certain level of credit risk associated with non-Medicare payors. To provide for our non-Medicare patient accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future, we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated net realizable value. We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of historical and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in payment and an evaluation of collectability based upon the date that the service was provided. Based upon our best judgment, we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for accounts that will not be collected due to credit risk. Insurance We are obligated for certain costs associated with our insurance programs, including employee health, workers compensation and professional liability. While we maintain various insurance programs to cover these risks, we are self-insured for a substantial portion of our potential claims. We recognize our obligations associated with these costs in the period in which a claim is incurred, including with respect to both reported claims and claims 51 Table of Contents incurred but not reported, up to specified deductible limits. These costs have generally been estimated based on historical data of our claims experience. Such estimates, and the resulting reserves, are reviewed and updated by us on a quarterly basis. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. These events or circumstances include but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business environment; regulatory environment or legal factors; or a substantial decline in market capitalization of our stock. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a two-step impairment test. In the first step of the test, the fair values of the reporting units are compared to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would proceed to step two of the test. In step two of the test, the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined by a hypothetical allocation of the fair value calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was reflective of the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess, if any, of the calculated fair value after hypothetical allocation to the reporting unit assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is greater than the carrying amount of the goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is not impaired and the analysis is complete. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is deemed impaired by the amount of that variance. We calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units using discounted cash flows as well as a market approach that compares our reporting units earnings and revenue multiples to those of comparable public companies. To determine fair value we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, in particular expected organic growth rates, future Medicare reimbursement rates, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates. Our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to our business model or changes in operating performance. These factors increase the risk of differences between projected and actual performance that could impact future estimates of fair value of all reporting units. Significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could result in additional impairment in future periods. Each of our operating segments described in the notes to our financial statements is considered to represent an individual reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. We consider each of our home health care centers to constitute an individual business for which discrete financial information is available. However, since these care centers have substantially similar operating and economic characteristics and resource allocation and significant investment decisions concerning these businesses are centralized and the benefits broadly distributed, we have aggregated these care centers and deemed them to constitute a single reporting unit. We have applied this same aggregation principle to our hospice care centers and have also deemed them to be a single reporting unit. During 2015, we did not record any goodwill impairment charges and none of the goodwill associated with our various reporting units were considered at risk of impairment as of October 31, 2015. Since the date of our last annual goodwill impairment test, there have been no material developments, events, changes in operating performance or other circumstances that would cause management to believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units would be less than its carrying amount. 52 Table of Contents Intangible assets consist of Certificates of Need, licenses, acquired names, non-compete agreements and reacquired franchise rights. We amortize non-compete agreements, acquired names that we do not intend to use in the future and reacquired franchise rights on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is generally three years for non-compete agreements and up to five years for reacquired franchise rights and acquired names. Income Taxes We use the asset and liability approach for measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences existing at each balance sheet date using currently enacted tax rates. Our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about future operations. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect of a change in tax rate is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 our net deferred tax assets were $125.2 million and $122.4 million, respectively. Management regularly assesses the ability to realize deferred tax assets recorded in the Company entities based upon the weight of available evidence, including such factors as the recent earnings history and expected future taxable income. In the event future taxable income is below management estimates or is generated in tax jurisdictions different than projected, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase in our effective tax rate.
