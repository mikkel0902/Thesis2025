(See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) Table of Contents PART I Item 1. Business. GENERAL We are a specialty finance company that invests in and finances residential mortgage assets. Our targeted investments include principally the following: Residential whole loans, including Purchased Performing Loans, Purchased Credit Deteriorated and Purchased Non-performing Loans. Through certain of our subsidiaries, we also originate and service business purpose loans for real estate investors. We also own residential real estate (or REO), which is typically acquired as a result of the foreclosure or other liquidation of delinquent whole loans in connection with our loan investment activities; Residential mortgage securities, including CRT securities; and MSR-related assets, which include term notes backed directly or indirectly by MSRs. Our principal business objective is to deliver shareholder value through the generation of distributable income and through asset performance linked to residential mortgage credit fundamentals. We selectively invest in residential mortgage assets with a focus on credit analysis, projected prepayment rates, interest rate sensitivity and expected return. We are an internally-managed real estate investment trust (or REIT). 2021 saw a continuation of the unprecedented conditions caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic, causing ongoing volatility and disruption in the United States economy and financial markets. However, the markets for residential mortgage assets have generally benefited from strong demand for housing and ongoing movement of people away from urban to suburban areas. In addition, fiscal policies of the federal government and monetary and other economic policies pursued by the U.S. Federal Reserve (or Federal Reserve) have resulted in continued historically low interest rates that have supported residential mortgage assets and markets. After the negative market impacts experienced during 2020, particularly during the initial months of the pandemic in the first and second quarters of the year, we significantly reduced the size and composition of our investment portfolio during 2020. During 2021, market conditions were generally more stable and supportive of our business and we took advantage of these market conditions to implement an asset acquisition strategy that resulted in significant growth of our residential whole loan portfolio. We also completed our first acquisition of a mortgage origination company, Lima One Capital, LLC (Lima One), a leading originator and servicer of business purpose loans. We discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including our investment and financing strategies, throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We were incorporated in Maryland on July 24, 1997 and began operations on April 10, 1998. We have elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must comply with a number of requirements under federal tax law, including that we must distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders. We have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries (or TRS). In general, a TRS may hold assets and engage in activities that a REIT or qualified REIT subsidiary (or QRS) cannot hold or engage in directly, and a TRS may generally engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. We are a holding company and conduct our real estate finance businesses primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries, so as to maintain an exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (or the Investment Company Act) by ensuring that less than 40% of the value of our total assets, exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items (which we refer to as our adjusted total assets for Investment Company Act purposes), on an unconsolidated basis, consist of investment securities as defined by the Investment Company Act. We refer to this test as the 40% Test. INVESTMENT STRATEGY We primarily invest, through our various subsidiaries, in residential mortgage assets. During 2021 we successfully executed on our asset acquisition strategy. Specifically, we acquired more than $4.5 billion of residential whole loans. We also completed the acquisition of the remaining 57% of the common equity interests of Lima One, the first time that we completed the acquisition of a controlling stake in a third party entity. We are particularly pleased with the results of the business combination to date, as Lima One has achieved consecutive record quarters for origination volumes since the acquisition closed on July 1, 2021. The execution of our strategy has resulted in a 49% year-over-year increase in our residential whole loans and 39% year-over-year increase in our overall investment portfolio. At the end of 2021, residential whole loan investments comprised approximately 87% of our assets and more than 75% of our allocated net equity. During 2022, assuming economic conditions continue to support markets for residential mortgage assets, we expect to continue pursuing investment opportunities 1 Table of Contents primarily focused on residential whole loans as market opportunities arise. We expect that our investment activities will continue to be financed through a combination of term loan warehouse financing, repurchase agreement financing and securitization transactions. At December 31, 2021, our total investment-related assets were comprised of the following: $7.9 billion, or 93%, of residential whole loans (compared to $5.3 billion, or 88%, at December 31, 2020); $256.7 million, or 3%, of residential mortgage securities and MSR-related assets (compared to $400.0 million, or 7%, at December 31, 2020); and $369.8 million, or 4%, of remaining investment-related assets, comprised primarily of REO, capital contributions made to loan origination partners, other interest-earning assets, and loan-related receivables (compared to $352.4 million, or 6% at December 31, 2020). Residential Whole Loans During 2021, we continued to increase our residential whole loan portfolio primarily through acquisitions of Purchased Performing Loans and loans originated by Lima One. Our Purchased Performing Loan portfolio includes: (i) loans to finance (or refinance) one-to-four family residential properties that are not considered to meet the definition of a Qualified Mortgage in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( Non-QM loans ), (ii) short-term business purpose loans collateralized by residential properties made to non-occupant borrowers who intend to rehabilitate and sell the property for a profit ( Rehabilitation loans or Fix and Flip loans ), (iii) loans to finance (or refinance) non-owner occupied one-to four-family residential properties that are rented to one or more tenants ( Single-family rental loans ), (iv) loans on investor properties that conform to the standards for purchase by a federally chartered corporation, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) ( Agency eligible investor loans ), and (v) previously originated loans secured by residential real estate that is generally owner occupied ( Seasoned performing loans ). In addition, during 2021, we continued to manage our Purchased Non-performing residential whole loan and Purchased Credit Deteriorated Loan portfolios. Purchased Credit Deteriorated Loans are typically characterized by borrowers who had previously experienced payment delinquencies and the amount owed may have exceeded the value of the property pledged as collateral at the time of acquisition. The majority of these loans were also acquired at purchase prices that were discounted (often substantially so) to their contractual loan balance to reflect the impaired credit history of the borrower, the loan-to-value ratio (or LTV) of the loan and the coupon rate. Purchased Non-performing Loans are typically characterized by borrowers who have defaulted on their obligations and/or have payment delinquencies of 60 days or more at the time we acquire the loan. These loans were typically purchased at significantly discounted prices to the contractual loan balance. We also own REO property as a result of managing the resolution of non-performing loans. A combination of strong loan portfolio performance, continued lower levels of foreclosure activity and the efforts of our asset management team, has resulted in a substantial decline in balances of REO property held during 2021. Securities, at Fair Value Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we owned significantly higher balances of residential mortgage securities (primarily investments in Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS and CRT securities). During 2020, we sold our Agency and Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolios and significantly reduced our CRT securities, RPL/NPL MBS and MSR-related assets. Going forward, we may invest selectively in residential mortgage securities and MSR-related assets as market opportunities arise, and we discuss the general features of our currently held portfolio below. MSR-Related Assets We have made investments in term notes backed directly or indirectly by MSRs. We believe the credit risk on these investments is mitigated by structural credit support in the form of over-collateralization as well as a corporate guarantee from the ultimate parent or sponsor of the related special purpose vehicle issuing the note, that is intended to provide for payment of interest and principal to the holders of the term notes should cash flows generated by the underlying MSRs be insufficient. Residential Mortgage Securities CRT securities are debt obligations issued by or sponsored by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The coupon payments on CRT securities are paid by the issuer and the principal payments received are dependent on the performance of loans in either a reference pool or an actual pool of loans. As an investor in a CRT security, we may incur a principal loss if the performance of the actual or reference pool loans results in either an actual or calculated loss that exceeds the credit enhancement on the security owned by us. We assess the credit risk associated with our investments in CRT securities by assessing the current and expected future performance of the associated loan pool. 2 Table of Contents MBS investments held during the year ended December 31, 2020 and in prior periods included Agency MBS and Non-Agency MBS, which included MBS issued prior to 2008. Until the second quarter of 2021, we also owned RPL/NPL MBS purchased primarily at prices around par and representing the senior and mezzanine tranches of the related securitizations. FINANCING STRATEGY Our financing strategy is designed to increase the size of our investment portfolio by borrowing against a substantial portion of the market value of the assets in our portfolio. We use term warehouse facilities, loan securitizations and shorter term repurchase agreements to finance our holdings of residential mortgage assets. Our financing strategy shifted significantly during 2020 and 2021. In particular, in response to the turmoil in the financial markets resulting from the conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we sought to implement more durable forms of borrowing, including warehouse lines with non-mark-to-market collateral terms. In addition, during the second half of 2020, we executed three securitization transactions for our residential whole loans. These programmatic securitization transactions continued during 2021 as we executed eight additional transactions involving Non-QM, business purpose, Agency eligible investor, Purchased Credit Deteriorated and Purchased Non-performing loan collateral. The securitization transactions generally lowered the funding costs and lengthened the term of funding for these assets and generated additional liquidity. In addition, securitized debt financing is non-recourse and does not include mark-to-market collateral provisions. Going forward, in connection with our current and any future investment in residential whole loans, we expect that our financing strategy will continue to include loan securitization and other forms of structured financing, subject to market conditions. COMPETITION We believe that our principal competitors in the business of acquiring and holding residential mortgage assets of the types in which we invest are financial institutions, such as banks, specialty finance companies, insurance companies, institutional investors, including mutual funds and pension funds, hedge funds and other mortgage REITs. Some of these entities may not be subject to the same regulatory constraints (i.e., REIT compliance or maintaining an exemption under the Investment Company Act) as we are. In addition, many of these entities have greater financial resources and access to capital than we have. The existence of these entities, as well as the possibility of additional entities forming in the future, may increase the competition for the acquisition of residential mortgage assets, resulting in higher prices and lower yields on such assets. EMPLOYEES/HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT At December 31, 2021, we had approximately 298 full-time employees, including 238 employees working in our Lima One subsidiary. We believe that investing in and fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce is a key pillar in operating our business. By supporting, recognizing, and investing in the employees, we believe that we are able to attract and retain the highest quality talent. REGULATORY MATTERS The U.S. Congress, Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (or FDIC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (or SEC) and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken actions in response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (or the Dodd-Frank Act) created a new regulator, an independent bureau housed within the Federal Reserve System known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (or the CFPB). The CFPB has broad authority over a wide range of consumer financial products and services, including mortgage lending and servicing. One portion of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (or Mortgage Reform Act), contains underwriting and servicing standards for the mortgage industry, restrictions on compensation for mortgage loan originators, and various other requirements related to mortgage origination and servicing. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act grants enforcement authority and broad discretionary regulatory authority to the CFPB to prohibit or condition terms, acts or practices relating to residential mortgage loans that the CFPB finds abusive, unfair, deceptive or predatory, as well as to take other actions that the CFPB finds are necessary or proper to ensure responsible affordable mortgage credit remains available to consumers. The Dodd-Frank Act also affects the securitization of mortgages (and other assets) with requirements for risk retention by securitizers and requirements for regulating rating agencies. 3 Table of Contents Numerous regulations have been issued pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, including regulations regarding mortgage loan servicing, underwriting and loan originator compensation, and others could be issued in the future. As a result, we are unable to fully predict at this time how the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as other laws or regulations that may be adopted in the future, will affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the environment for repurchase financing and other forms of borrowing, the investing environment for Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS and/or residential mortgage loans, the securitization industry, interest rate swap agreements (or Swaps) and other derivatives. We believe that the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder are likely to continue to increase the economic and compliance costs for participants in the mortgage and securitization industries, including us. In addition to the regulatory actions being implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act, on August 31, 2011, the SEC issued a concept release under which it is reviewing interpretive issues related to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(5)(C) excludes from the definition of investment company entities that are primarily engaged in, among other things, purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate. Many companies that engage in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage-related instruments seek to rely on existing interpretations of the SEC Staff with respect to Section 3(c)(5)(C) so as not to be deemed an investment company for the purpose of regulation under the Investment Company Act. In connection with the concept release, the SEC requested comments on, among other things, whether it should reconsider its existing interpretation of Section 3(c)(5)(C). We currently rely on the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, and we seek to continue to meet the requirements for this exemption from registration. To date the SEC has not taken or otherwise announced any further action in connection with the concept release. In conjunction with our legal department, we closely monitor our compliance with Section 3(c)(5)(C) within our risk management program. (For additional discussion of the SEC concept release and its potential impact on us, please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) The Federal Housing Finance Agency (or FHFA) and both houses of Congress have discussed and considered various measures intended to restructure the U.S. housing finance system and the operations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Congress may continue to consider legislation that would significantly reform the country mortgage finance system, including, among other things, eliminating Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and replacing them with a single new MBS insurance agency. Many details remain unsettled, including the scope and costs of the agencies guarantee and their affordable housing mission, some of which could be addressed even in the absence of large-scale reform. On March 27, 2019, then President Trump issued a memorandum on federal housing finance reform that directed the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a plan for administrative and legislative reforms as soon as practicable to achieve the following housing reform goals: 1) ending the conservatorships of the Government-sponsored enterprises (or GSEs) upon the completion of specified reforms; 2) facilitating competition in the housing finance market; 3) establishing regulation of the GSEs that safeguards their safety and soundness and minimizes the risks they pose to the financial stability of the United States; and 4) providing that the federal government is properly compensated for any explicit or implicit support it provides to the GSEs or the secondary housing finance market. On September 5, 2019, in response to then President Trump memorandum, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released a plan, developed in conjunction with the FHFA, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and other government agencies, which includes legislative and administrative reforms to achieve each of these reform goals. At this point, it remains unclear whether any of these legislative or regulatory reforms will be enacted or implemented. On June 23, 2021, the United States Supreme Court concluded that the structure of the FHFA (which insulated its director from removal by the President) was unconstitutional and remanded the case for further proceedings. Subsequent to the Supreme Court ruling, President Biden dismissed the FHFA director and appointed an acting replacement, raising further questions as to whether any of these legislative or regulatory reforms discussed above will be enacted or implemented. The prospects for passage of any of these plans are uncertain, and the change in FHFA leadership underscores the potential for change to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. While the likelihood of enactment of major mortgage finance system reform in the short term remains uncertain, it is possible that the adoption of any such reforms could adversely affect the types of assets we can buy, the costs of these assets and our business operations. A reduction in the ability of mortgage loan originators to access Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to sell their mortgage loans may adversely affect the mortgage markets generally and adversely affect the ability of mortgagors to refinance their mortgage loans. In addition, any decline in the value of securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may affect the value of MBS in general. The recent change of FHFA Leadership and the fact that a permanent Director has yet to be confirmed raise further uncertainties about whether, and if so on what timeline, the Biden administration will address the conservatorships of the GSEs and any such comprehensive housing reform. On October 27, 2021, FHFA announced that it is seeking comment on a proposed rulemaking that would introduce additional public disclosure requirements for the Enterprise Regulatory Capital Framework (or ERCF) for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As proposed, the rule would implement quarterly quantitative and qualitative disclosure requirements for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac related to regulatory capital instruments, risk-weighted assets calculated under the ERCF standardized approach, and risk management policies and procedures. This notice of proposed rulemaking suggests the potential for 4 Table of Contents enhanced regulation and reporting obligations in the mortgage and securitization industries, which in turn may further increase the economic and compliance costs for participants in the mortgage and securitization industries, including us. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (or CARES Act) was signed into law. Among the provisions in this wide-ranging law are protections for homeowners experiencing financial difficulties due to COVID-19, including forbearance provisions and procedures. Borrowers with federally backed mortgage loans, regardless of delinquency status, may request loan forbearance for a six-month period, with the option to extend forbearance for another six-month period if necessary. Although the initial deadline to request forbearance on federally backed loans was set to expire under the CARES Act on December 31, 2020, the FHFA and CFPB have announced extensions for several measures to align COVID-19 mortgage relief policies across the federal government, including additional three-month extensions of COVID-19 forbearance or payment deferral options for certain borrowers. Federally backed mortgage loans are loans secured by first- or subordinate-liens on 1-4 family residential real property, including individual units of condominiums and cooperatives, which are insured or guaranteed pursuant to certain government housing programs, such as by the Federal Housing Administration (or FHA), or U.S. Department of Agriculture, or are purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The CARES Act also included a temporary 60-day foreclosure moratorium that applies to federally backed mortgage loans, which lasted until July 24, 2020. However, the foreclosure moratorium was extended several times to July 31, 2021 and the forbearance enrollment window was extended through September 30, 2021 by Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Agriculture and FHFA, which includes mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Although the federal foreclosure moratorium expired on July 31, 2021, various states and local jurisdictions also imposed foreclosure moratoriums, some of which may continue to be in effect after the federal moratorium expires. In December 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law, which is an omnibus spending bill that included a second COVID-19 stimulus bill (or Second Stimulus). In addition to providing stimulus checks for individuals and families, the Second Stimulus provides for, among other things, (i) an extension of federal unemployment insurance benefits, (ii) funding to help individuals connect remotely during the pandemic, (iii) tax credits for companies offering paid sick leave and (iv) funding for vaccine distribution and development. As further described below, the Second Stimulus provided an additional $25 billion in tax-free rental assistance and an executive order by President Biden extended the temporary eviction moratorium promulgated by the CDC (described below) through March 31, 2021. On September 1, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (or CDC) issued an order effective September 4, 2020 through December 31, 2020 temporarily halting residential evictions to prevent the further spread of COVID-19. The Second Stimulus extended the order to January 31, 2021 and on January 20, 2021, Present Joseph Biden signed an executive order that, among other things, further extended the temporary eviction moratorium promulgated by the CDC through March 31, 2021. The CDC order was further extended through July 31, 2021, and on August 3, 2021, it was further extended through October 3, 2021, to those U.S. counties experiencing substantial and high spread of the COVID-19 as of such date (which includes a significant majority of the counties in the United States). However, on August 26, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court declared the order unconstitutional, and so it is no longer in effect. The Court ruling does not affect or preclude state and local jurisdictions from issuing orders stopping or limiting evictions and foreclosures in an effort to lessen the financial burden created by COVID-19 in their jurisdictions. Any such limitations could adversely impact the cash flow on mortgage loans. On July 30, 2021, FHFA announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are extending the moratorium on single-family real estate owned (REO) evictions until September 30, 2021. The Biden Administration may pass additional stimulus bills, foreclosure relief measures and may reinstate foreclosure and eviction moratoriums that may continue to adversely impact the cash flow on mortgage loans. On June 28, 2021, the CFPB Issued a Final Rule amending Regulation X under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act to provide additional foreclosure protections to borrowers. The Final Rule became effective August 31, 2021 and applies to mortgage loans secured by real property that is a borrower principal residence. Among other things, the servicing rule bars new foreclosure filings until after December 31, 2021, unless certain criteria are met or an exception applies; requires servicers to engage in early intervention efforts for certain borrowers; permits certain streamlined loan modification options for borrowers with COVID-19-related hardships; and imposes specific requirements for servicers of borrowers currently in short-term payment forbearance programs that were offered based on incomplete loss mitigation applications. These mortgage servicing rules and any similar regulations passed by CFPB in the future could adversely impact the cash flow on mortgage loans. 5 Table of Contents AVAILABLE INFORMATION We maintain a website at www.mfafinancial.com.

If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur or continue to occur, these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity. These events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities. Summary Risk Factors Credit and Other Risks Related to Our Investments Our investments in residential whole loans, residential mortgage securities and MSR-related assets involve credit risk, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Our investments are subject to changes in credit spreads and other risks. A significant portion of our residential whole loans and residential mortgage securities are secured by properties in a small number of geographic areas and may be disproportionately affected by economic or housing downturns, our competition, natural disasters, terrorist events, pandemics, regulatory changes, adverse climate changes or other adverse events specific to those markets. We are subject to counterparty risk and may be unable to seek indemnity or require counterparties to repurchase residential whole loans if they breach representations and warranties, which could cause us to suffer losses. The due diligence we undertake on potential investments may be limited and/or not reveal all of the risks associated with such investments and may not reveal other weaknesses in such assets, which could lead to losses. We have experienced and may experience in the future increased volatility in our U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (or GAAP) results of operations due in part to the increasing contribution to financial results of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, declines in the market value of certain of our investment securities resulting in our recording impairments, which have had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The use of models in connection with the valuation of our assets subjects us to potential risks in the event that such models are incorrect, misleading or based on incomplete information. Valuations of some of our assets are subject to inherent uncertainty, may be based on estimates, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may differ from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these assets existed. Our investments in residential whole loans are difficult to value and are dependent upon the borrower ability to service or refinance their debt. The inability of the borrower to do so could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. Mortgage loan modification and refinancing programs and future legislative action may materially adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, our MBS and residential whole loan investments. We may be adversely affected by risks affecting borrowers or the asset or property types in which certain of our investments may be concentrated at any given time, as well as from unfavorable changes in the related geographic regions. 6 Table of Contents Our investments in residential whole loans subject us to servicing-related risks, including those associated with foreclosure and liquidation. The expanding body of federal, state and local regulations and investigations of originators and servicers may increase costs of compliance and the risks of noncompliance, and may adversely affect servicers ability to perform their servicing obligations. Our ability to sell REO on terms acceptable to us or at all may be limited. Our investments in MSR-related assets expose us to additional risks. Our investments in mortgage loan originators expose us to additional risks. We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Lima One acquisition. Prepayment and Reinvestment Risk Prepayment rates on the mortgage loans underlying certain of our residential mortgage assets may materially adversely affect our profitability or could require us to sell assets in unfavorable market conditions. Risks Related to Our Use of Leverage Our business strategy involves the use of leverage, and we may not achieve what we believe to be optimal levels of leverage or we may become overleveraged, which may materially adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations or financial condition. An increase in our borrowing costs relative to the interest we receive on our investments may materially adversely affect our profitability. The discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (or LIBOR) may affect our financial results. Certain of our current lenders require, and future lenders may require, that we enter into restrictive covenants relating to our operations. The use of non-recourse long-term financing structures expose us to risks, which could result in losses to us. Risks Associated with Adverse Developments in the Mortgage Finance and Credit Markets and Financial Markets Generally Market conditions for mortgages and mortgage-related assets as well as the broader financial markets may materially adversely affect the value of the assets in which we invest. A lack of liquidity in our investments may materially adversely affect our business. Actions by the U.S. Government designed to stabilize or reform the financial markets may not achieve their intended effect or otherwise benefit our business, and could materially adversely affect our business. Risks Related to Our Use of Hedging Strategies Our use of hedging strategies to mitigate our interest rate exposure may not be effective. We may enter into hedging instruments that could expose us to contingent liabilities in the future, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. The characteristics of hedging instruments present various concerns, including illiquidity, enforceability, and counterparty risks, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Taxation as a REIT and the Taxation of Our Assets If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability, which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders. If our foreign TRS is subject to U.S. federal income tax at the entity level, it would greatly reduce the amounts those entities would have available to pay its creditors and distribute to us. Our use of TRSs may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. We have not established a minimum dividend payment level, and there is no guarantee that we will maintain current dividend payment levels or pay dividends in the future. Our reported GAAP net income may differ from the amount of REIT taxable income and dividend distribution requirements and, therefore, our GAAP results may not be an accurate indicator of future taxable income and dividend distributions. The failure of assets subject to repurchase agreements to qualify as real estate assets could adversely affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. We may be required to report taxable income for certain investments in excess of the economic income we ultimately realize from them. The interest apportionment rules may affect our ability to comply with the REIT asset and gross income tests. Dividends paid by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for qualified dividend income. 7 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure Provisions of Maryland law and other provisions of our organizational documents may limit the ability of a third-party to acquire control of the Company. Future offerings of debt securities, which would rank senior to our common stock upon liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities, which would dilute our existing stockholders and may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. General The results of our business operations are affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets and collateral, which is driven by numerous factors, including the supply and demand for residential mortgage assets in the marketplace, our ability to source new investments at appropriate yields, the terms and availability of adequate financing, general economic and real estate conditions (both on a national and local level), the impact of government actions, especially in the real estate and mortgage sector, our competition, and the credit performance of our credit sensitive residential mortgage assets. Our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates, the slope of the yield curve (i.e., the differential between long-term and short-term interest rates), market credit spreads, borrowing costs (i.e., our interest expense), delinquencies, defaults and prepayment speeds on our investments, the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties. Interest rates and conditional prepayment rates (or CPRs) (which are a measure the amount of unscheduled principal prepayment on a loan or security) vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results also depend upon our ability to effectively manage the risks associated with our business operations, including interest rate, prepayment, financing, liquidity, and credit risks, while maintaining our qualification as a REIT. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and may continue to do so. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected our business, and we believe it may continue to do so. The early 2020 outbreak caused significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets both in the United States and globally, and periods of market volatility and disruption have continued to occur at various times since the initial outbreak, in particular when new variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 appear and increases in the number of new cases, hospitalizations or deaths occur. If COVID-19, or another highly infectious or contagious disease, continues to spread or otherwise remain at high levels, or the response (including vaccines) to contain it is unsuccessful, we could continue to, or once again begin to, experience material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. The extent of such effects will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the geographic spread of COVID-19, or another highly infectious or contagious disease, the overall severity of the disease, the development and characteristics of variants (including variants not yet identified) of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, the effectiveness and acceptance of vaccines, the measures taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak (such as quarantines and travel restrictions) and the possible impacts on the global economy. The continued spread of COVID-19 and health related concerns could also negatively impact the availability of key personnel who are necessary to conduct our business. The U.S. federal government and many state and local governments adopted a number of emergency measures and recommendations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including imposing travel bans, shelter in place restrictions and curfews, cancelling events, banning large gatherings, closing non-essential businesses, mandating vaccinations and generally promoting social distancing (including in the workplace, which has resulted in a significant increase in employees working remotely). Although many of these measures and recommendations have been lifted or suspended, some continue to remain in place, and the suspended measures could be reimposed in the event of an increase in transmis sion of the virus. Across the country, moratoriums were put in place in certain states to stop evictions and foreclosures and some remain in place or could be reimposed. In an effort to lessen the financial burden created by the COVID-19 pandemic and various states have even promulgated guidance to regulated servicers requiring them to formulate policies to assist mortgagors in need as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of states have enacted laws which impose significant limits on the default remedies of lenders secured by real property. While some states have begun a phased relaxation of certain of these measures, certain restrictions on economic activity remain in place, and others may be reintroduced. Although it cannot be predicted, additional policy action at the federal, state and local level is possible. The COVID-19 pandemic (and any future COVID-19 outbreaks) and resulting emergency measures have led (and may continue to lead) to significant disruptions in the global supply chain, global capital markets, the economy of the United States and the economies of other nations. Concern about the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of measures put in place by governmental bodies and reserve banks at various levels as well as by private enterprises to contain or mitigate its spread has adversely affected economic conditions and capital markets globally, and has led to significant volatility in global financial markets. There can be no assurance that the containment 8 Table of Contents measures or other measures implemented from time to time will be successful in limiting the spread of the virus and what effect those measures will have on the economy. While many economic activities have to some extent returned to normal in certain jurisdictions, whether and when and to what extent many activities will return remains uncertain, and may vary substantially depending on the location and the type of activity. There may be further disruption and volatility in the credit markets and the reduction of economic activity in severely affected sectors in the United States and/or globally. Governments have adopted, and we expect may continue to adopt, policies, laws and plans intended to address the COVID-19 pandemic and adverse developments in the credit, financial and mortgage markets. We cannot predict the ultimate effect that any policies, laws and plans adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic will have on us. Any significant decrease in economic activity or resulting decline in the housing market could have an adverse effect on our investments in mortgage real estate assets. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has created an uncertain and volatile interest rate environment and general fixed income patterns have deviated widely from historical trends, all of which could adversely affect our business. With respect to prepayments, given the combination of low interest rates, government stimulus, inflation and fluctuating unemployment, as well as other disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become more difficult to predict prepayment levels for the securities in our portfolio. As a result, actual prepayment results may be materially different from our estimates. With respect to our hedging activities, given recent market uncertainty, the spread between MBS, hedges and benchmark rates widened significantly. It is uncertain when normal market correlations will resume in the fixed income markets. Further, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic impact on the overall economy, such as changes in consumer behavior related to loans as well as government policies and pronouncements, borrowers may experience difficulties meeting their obligations or seek to forbear payment on or refinance their mortgage loans to avail themselves of lower rates, which may adversely affect our result of operations (particularly as related to assets we own that expose us to credit risk, as discussed below). Thus, the credit risk profile on our assets may be more pronounced in the mortgage, housing and related sectors, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We may change our investment strategy, operating policies and/or asset allocations without stockholder consent, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. We may change our investment strategy, operating policies and/or asset allocation with respect to investments, acquisitions, leverage, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and distributions at any time without the consent of our stockholders which would result in an investment portfolio with a different risk profile (including an investment portfolio that may be more concentrated in a particular class of asset). For example, related to the impact of the unprecedented conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020 we sold all of our MBS and substantially reduced our investments in MSR-related assets and CRT securities, resulting in our residential whole loans becoming by far our largest asset. A change in our investment strategy may increase our exposure to various risks, including but not limited to: interest rate risk, credit risk, default risk, liquidity risk, financing risk, legal or regulatory risk, and/or real estate market fluctuations. Furthermore, a change in our asset allocation could result in our making investments in asset categories different from those of our historical investments. These changes could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock or our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. Maintaining cybersecurity and data security is important to our business and a breach of our cybersecurity or data security could result in serious harm to our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. When we acquire or originate real estate mortgage loans, we come into possession of borrower non-public personal information that an identity thief could utilize in engaging in fraudulent activity or theft. We may share this information with third parties, such as loan sub-servicers, outside vendors, third parties interested in acquiring such loans from us, or lenders extending credit to us collateralized by such loans. We have acquired more than 30,000 residential mortgage loans since 2014, and our Lima One subsidiary, which we acquired in July 2021, has originated several thousand mortgage loans since its founding in 2011. While we have security measures in place to protect this information and prevent security breaches, these security measures may be compromised as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, cyber-attacks, "phishing" attacks, service provider or vendor error, or malfeasance or other intentional or unintentional acts by third parties and bad actors, including third-party service providers. Furthermore, borrower data, including personally identifiable information, may be lost, exposed, or subject to unauthorized access or use as a result of accidents, errors, or malfeasance by our employees, independent contractors, or others working with us or on our behalf. Our servers and systems, and those of our 9 Table of Contents service providers, may be vulnerable to computer malware, break-ins, denial-of-service attacks, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to borrowers data or our data, including other confidential business information. In the past, we have experienced unauthorized access to certain data and information. Our response was to take immediate steps to investigate and address the unauthorized access, and past unauthorized access has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. We have further developed and enhanced our cybersecurity systems and processes that are intended to protect this type of data and information; however, they may not be effective in preventing unauthorized access in the future. While past unauthorized access has been immaterial to our business and financial results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period. We may be liable for losses suffered by individuals whose identities are stolen as a result of a breach of the security of the systems that we or third-parties and service providers of ours store this information on, and any such liability could be material. Even if we are not liable for such losses, any breach of these systems could expose us to material costs in notifying affected individuals and providing credit monitoring services to them, as well as regulatory fines or penalties. In addition, any breach of these systems could disrupt our normal business operations and expose us to reputational damage and lost business, revenues, and profits. Any insurance we maintain against the risk of this type of loss may not be sufficient to cover actual losses, or may not apply to the circumstances relating to any particular breach. Security breaches could also significantly damage our reputation with existing and prospective loan sellers, borrowers, and third parties with whom we do business. Any publicized security problems affecting our businesses and/or those of such third parties may negatively impact the market perception of our products and discourage market participants from doing business with us. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our reliance on the internet and use of web-based product offerings and on the use of cybersecurity. We are dependent on information systems and their failure (including in connection with cyber-attacks) could significantly disrupt our business. Our business is highly dependent on our information and communications systems, including systems containing or using open source software.. Any failure or interruption of our systems or cyber-attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems could cause delays or other problems in our securities trading activities, which could have a material adverse effect on operating results, the market price of our common stock and other securities and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Our use of open source software poses particular risk, including potential security vulnerabilities, licensing compliance issues and quality issues. In addition, we also face the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third-parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including clearing agents or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions as well as the servicers of our loans. Computer malware, viruses, hacking and phishing and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent in our industry and may occur on our systems in the future. Additionally, due to the transition to remote working environments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an elevated risk of such events occurring. Although we have not detected a material cybersecurity breach to date, there can be no assurance that we are or will be fully protected against cyber risks and security breaches and not be vulnerable to new and evolving threats to our information technology systems. We rely heavily on financial, accounting and other data processing systems. It is difficult to determine what, if any, negative impact may directly result from any specific interruption or cyber-attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems (or networks or systems of, among other third-parties, our lenders and servicers) or any failure to maintain performance, reliability and security of our technical infrastructure. As a result, any such computer malware, viruses, hacking, phishing and cyber-attacks may negatively affect our operations. Credit and Other Risks Related to Our Investments Our investments in residential whole loans, residential mortgage securities and MSR-related assets involve credit risk, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Investors in residential mortgage assets assume the risk that the related borrowers may default on their obligations to make full and timely payments of principal and interest. Under our investment policy, we may invest in residential whole loans, residential mortgage securities, MSR-related assets and other investment assets of that may be considered to be lower 10 Table of Contents credit quality. In general, these investments are less exposed to credit risk than Agency MBS because the former are not guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S. Government, any federal agency or any federally chartered corporation. Higher-than-expected rates of default and/or higher-than-expected loss severities on the mortgages underlying these investments could adversely affect the value of these assets. Accordingly, defaults in the payment of principal and/or interest on our residential whole loans, residential mortgage securities, MSR-related assets and other investment assets of less-than-high credit quality could result in our incurring losses of income from, and/or losses in market value relating to, these assets, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. This risk may be more pronounced during times of market volatility and negative economic conditions, such as those being experienced in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our portfolio of residential whole loans is by far our largest asset class and represented approximately 87% of our total assets as of December 31, 2021. We expect that our investment portfolio in residential whole loans will continue to increase during 2022. As a holder of residential whole loans, we are subject to the risk that the related borrowers may default or have defaulted on their obligations to make full and timely payments of principal and interest. A number of factors impact a borrower ability to repay including, among other things, changes in employment status, changes in interest rates or the availability of credit, and changes in real estate values. In addition to the credit risk associated with these assets, residential whole loans are less liquid than certain of our other credit sensitive assets, which may make them more difficult to dispose of if the need or desire arises. For example, upon the onset of the volatility created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we were unable to efficiently liquidate residential whole loans to raise liquidity. If actual results are different from our assumptions in determining the prices paid to acquire such loans, particularly if the market value of the underlying properties decreases significantly subsequent to purchase, we may incur significant losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Our investments are subject to changes in credit spreads and other risks. Credit spreads, which at times can be very volatile and react to various macroeconomic events or conditions, measure the additional yield demanded on securities by the market based on their perceived credit relative to a specific benchmark. Fixed rate securities are valued based on a market credit spread over the rate payable on fixed rate U.S. Treasuries of like maturity. Floating rate securities are generally valued based on a market credit spread over LIBOR (which is under reform and may be replaced, as discussed below). Excessive supply of these securities combined with reduced demand will generally cause the market to require a higher yield on these securities, resulting in the use of a higher, or wider, spread over the benchmark rate to value such securities. Under such conditions, the value of our MBS portfolio would tend to decline. Conversely, if the spread used to value such securities were to decrease, or tighten, the value of MBS would tend to increase. In addition, MBS valuations are subject to other financial risks, including mortgage basis spread risk. In periods of market volatility, changes in credit spreads and mortgage basis may result in changes in the value of MBS not being equally offset by changes in the value of derivative contracts used to manage portfolio valuation risks arising due to changes in interest rates. Such changes in the market value of our investments may affect our net equity, net income or cash flow directly through their impact on portfolio unrealized gains or losses, and therefore our ability to realize gains on such investments, or indirectly through their impact on our ability to borrow and access capital. This risk may be more pronounced during times of market volatility and negative economic conditions, such as those being experienced in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our residential whole loans and residential mortgage securities are secured by properties in a small number of geographic areas and may be disproportionately affected by economic or housing downturns, our competition, natural disasters, terrorist events, pandemics, regulatory changes, adverse climate changes or other adverse events specific to those markets. A significant number of the mortgages underlying our residential whole loans and residential mortgage securities are concentrated in certain geographic areas. For example, we have significant exposure in California, Florida, New York, New Jersey and Texas. (For a discussion of the percentage of these assets in these states, see Credit Risk included under Part II, Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) Certain markets within these states (particularly in California and Florida) have experienced significant decreases in residential home values from time to time. Any event that adversely affects the economy or real estate market in any of these states could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our residential whole loan and residential mortgage securities. In general, any material decline in the economy or significant problems in a particular real estate market would likely cause a decline in the value of residential properties securing the mortgages in that market, thereby increasing the risk of delinquency, default and foreclosure of residential whole loans and the loans underlying our residential mortgage securities and the risk of loss upon liquidation of these assets. This could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our credit loss experience on residential mortgage investments in the affected market if higher-than-expected rates of default and/or higher-than-expected loss severities on our investments in residential whole loans and residential mortgage securities were to occur. 11 Table of Contents In addition, the occurrence of a natural disaster (such as an earthquake, tornado, hurricane, flood, mudslide or wildfires), pandemic, terrorist attack or a significant adverse climate change, including potential rises in sea-levels, may cause a sudden decrease in the value of real estate in the area or areas affected and would likely reduce the value of the properties securing the mortgages collateralizing our residential whole loans or residential mortgage securities. Because certain natural disasters are not typically covered by the standard hazard insurance policies maintained by borrowers (such as hurricanes, earthquakes or certain flooding), or the proceeds payable for losses covered by any such policy are not sufficient to make the related repairs, the affected borrowers may have to pay for any repairs themselves. Under these circumstances, borrowers may decide not to repair the damaged property or may stop paying the mortgage, either of which could cause defaults and credit loss severities to increase. The risks discussed above may be more pronounced during times of market volatility and negative economic conditions, such as those experienced in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in governmental laws and regulations, enforcement priorities, fiscal policies, property taxes and zoning ordinances can also have a negative impact on property values, which could result in borrowers deciding to stop paying their mortgages. This circumstance could cause defaults and loss severities to increase, thereby adversely impacting our results of operations. We are subject to counterparty risk and may be unable to seek indemnity or require counterparties to repurchase residential whole loans if they breach representations and warranties, which could cause us to suffer losses. In connection with our residential whole loan investments, we typically enter into a loan purchase agreement, as buyer, of the loans from a seller. When we invest in certain mortgage loans, sellers may make representations and warranties about such loans that are very limited both in scope and duration. Residential mortgage loan purchase agreements may entitle the purchaser of the loans to seek indemnity or demand repurchase or substitution of the loans in the event the seller of the loans breaches a representation or warranty given to the purchaser. However, there can be no assurance that a mortgage loan purchase agreement will contain appropriate representations and warranties, that we or the trust that purchases the mortgage loans would be able to enforce a contractual right to repurchase or substitution, or that the seller of the loans will remain solvent or otherwise be able to honor its obligations under its mortgage loan purchase agreements. The inability to obtain or enforce an indemnity or require repurchase of a significant number of loans could require us to absorb the associated losses, and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and business. The due diligence we undertake on potential investments may be limited and/or not reveal all of the risks associated with such investments and may not reveal other weaknesses in such assets, which could lead to losses. Before making an investment, we typically conduct (either directly or using third-parties) certain due diligence. There can be no assurance that we will conduct any specific level of due diligence, or that, among other things, our due diligence processes will uncover all relevant facts, which could result in losses on these assets to the extent we ultimately acquire them, which, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and business. We have experienced and may experience in the future increased volatility in our GAAP results of operations due in part to the increasing contribution to financial results of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option. We have elected the fair value option accounting model for certain of our investments and financing agreements. Changes in the fair value of assets, and a portion of the changes in the fair value of liabilities, accounted for using the fair value option are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations each period, which may result in volatility in our financial results. For example, we experienced such volatility particularly during the first and second quarters of 2020, at the height of the COVID-19-related market dislocations. There can be no assurance that such volatility in periodic financial results will not occur during 2022 or in future periods. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, declines in the market value of certain of our investment securities resulting in our recording impairments, which have had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A decline in the market value of our residential mortgage securities that are accounted for as available-for-sale (or AFS) may require us to recognize impairment against such assets under GAAP. When the fair value of an AFS security is less than its amortized cost at the balance sheet date, the security is considered impaired. If we intend to sell an impaired security, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired security before any anticipated recovery, then we must recognize charges to earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment amortized cost and its fair value at the 12 Table of Contents balance sheet date. If we do not expect to sell an impaired security, only the portion of the impairment related to credit losses is recognized through charges to earnings with the remainder recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (or AOCI) on our consolidated balance sheets. Impairments recognized through other comprehensive income/(loss) (or OCI) do not impact earnings. Following the recognition of an impairment through earnings, a valuation allowance will be established for the security. The determination as to the amount of credit impairment recognized in earnings is subjective, as such determination is based on factual information available at the time of assessment as well as on our estimates of the future performance and cash flow projections. As a result, the timing and amount of impairments recognized in earnings constitute material estimates that are susceptible to significant change. The use of models in connection with the valuation and credit losses of our assets subjects us to potential risks in the event that such models are incorrect, misleading or based on incomplete information. As part of our risk management process, models may be used to evaluate, depending on the asset class, house price appreciation and depreciation by county or region, prepayment speeds and frequency, cost and timing of foreclosures, as well as other factors. Certain assumptions used as inputs to the models may be based on historical trends. These trends may not be indicative of future results. Furthermore, the assumptions underlying the models may prove to be inaccurate, causing the model output also to be incorrect. In particular, the economic, financial and related impacts of events like the COVID-19 pandemic have been and will continue to be very difficult to model (including their impact on the housing and mortgage markets), as such events may be unprecedented in modern history and therefore subject to unique variables, assumptions and inputs, making historical data used in models less reliable. In the event models and data prove to be incorrect, misleading or incomplete, any decisions made in reliance thereon expose us to potential risks. For example, by relying on incorrect models and data, we may overestimate or underestimate credit losses, buy certain assets at prices that are too high, sell certain assets at prices that are too low or miss favorable opportunities altogether, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results, business and growth prospects. Valuations of some of our assets are subject to inherent uncertainty, may be based on estimates, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may differ from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these assets existed. While the determination of the fair value of our investment assets generally takes into consideration valuations provided by third-party dealers and pricing services, the final determination of exit price fair values for our investment assets is based on our judgment, and such valuations may differ from those provided by third-party dealers and pricing services. Valuations of certain assets may be difficult to obtain or may not be reliable (particularly as related to residential whole loans, as discussed below). In general, dealers and pricing services heavily disclaim their valuations as such valuations are not intended to be binding bid prices. Additionally, dealers may claim to furnish valuations only as an accommodation and without special compensation, and so they may disclaim any and all liability arising out of any inaccuracy or incompleteness in valuations. Depending on the complexity and illiquidity of an asset, valuations of the same asset can vary substantially from one dealer or pricing service to another. Wide disparity in asset valuations may be more pronounced during periods when market participants are engaged in distressed sales, as was experienced in the early stage of the COVID-19 related market volatility. Our results of operations, financial condition and business could be materially adversely affected if our fair value determinations of these assets are materially higher than could actually be realized in the market. Our investments in residential whole loans are difficult to value and are dependent upon the borrower ability to service or refinance their debt. The inability of the borrower to do so could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. The difficulty in valuation is particularly significant with respect to our less liquid investments such as our re-performing loans (or RPLs) and non-performing loans (or NPLs). RPLs are loans on which a borrower was previously delinquent but has resumed repaying. Our ability to sell RPLs for a profit depends on the borrower continuing to make payments. An RPL could become a NPL, which could reduce our earnings. Our investments in residential whole loans may require us to engage in workout negotiations, restructuring and/or the possibility of foreclosure. These processes may be lengthy and expensive. If loans become REO, we, through a designated servicer that we retain, will have to manage these properties and may not be able to sell them. See the Risk Factor captioned Credit and Other Risks Related to Our Investments - Our ability to sell REO on terms acceptable to us or at all may be limited. We may work with our third-party servicers and seek to help a borrower to refinance an NPL or RPL to realize greater value from such loan. However, there may be impediments to executing a refinancing strategy for NPLs and RPLs. For example during 2020, many mortgage lenders adjusted their loan programs and underwriting standards, which reduced the 13 Table of Contents availability of mortgage credit to certain borrowers. This resulted in reduced availability of financing alternatives for borrowers seeking to refinance their mortgage loans.. To the extent prevailing mortgage interest rates rise from their current low levels, these risks would be exacerbated. The effect of the above would likely serve to make the refinancing of NPLs and RPLs potentially more difficult and less profitable for us. Mortgage loan modification and refinancing programs and future legislative action may materially adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, our MBS and residential whole loan investments. The U.S. Government, through the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury Department, the FHA, the CFPB, and other agencies have in the past implemented, and may in the future implement, a number of federal programs designed to assist homeowners and help them avoid residential mortgage loan foreclosures, reduce or forgive certain mortgage payments, or otherwise mitigate losses for homeowners. In addition, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac implemented their Flex Modification foreclosure prevention program, developed at the direction of the FHFA. Federal loss mitigation programs, as well as proprietary loss mitigation programs offered by investors and servicers, may involve, among other things, the modification of mortgage loans to reduce the principal amount of the loans (through forbearance and/or forgiveness) and/or the rate of interest payable on the loans, or to extend the payment terms of the loans. Especially with respect to our Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loan investments, loan modifications with respect to a given underlying loan, including, but not limited to, those related to principal payment deferrals, forbearance agreements, forgiveness and coupon reduction, could negatively impact the realized yields and cash flows on such investments. These loan modification programs, future legislative or regulatory actions, including possible amendments to the bankruptcy laws, that result in the modification of outstanding residential mortgage loans, as well as changes in the requirements necessary to qualify for refinancing mortgage loans with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae, may materially adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, these assets. See the Risk Factor captioned Risks Associated with Adverse Developments in the Mortgage Finance and Credit Markets and Financial Markets Generally - Actions by the U.S. Government designed to stabilize or reform the financial markets may not achieve their intended effect or otherwise benefit our business, and could materially adversely affect our business in this Form 10-K. The Biden administration and Congress may propose and adopt changes in federal policies that have significant impacts on the legal and regulatory framework affecting the mortgage industry. These changes, including personnel changes at the applicable regulatory agencies, may alter the nature and scope of oversight affecting the mortgage finance industry generally and particularly the future role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We may be adversely affected by risks affecting borrowers or the asset or property types in which certain of our investments may be concentrated at any given time, as well as from unfavorable changes in the related geographic regions. We are not required to limit our assets in terms of geographic location, diversification or concentration, except that we concentrate in residential mortgage-related investments. Accordingly, our investment portfolio may be concentrated by geography (see the Risk Factor captioned Credit and Other Risks Related to Our Investments - A significant portion of our residential whole loans and residential mortgage securities are secured by properties in a small number of geographic areas and may be disproportionately affected by economic or housing downturns, our competition, natural disasters, terrorist events, pandemics, regulatory changes, adverse climate changes or other adverse events specific to those markets in this Form 10-K), asset type (as is the case currently, as residential whole loans are by far our most concentrated asset type), property type and/or borrower, increasing the risk of loss to us if the particular concentration in our portfolio is subject to greater risks or is undergoing adverse developments. In addition, adverse conditions in the areas where the properties securing or otherwise underlying our investments are located (including business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, such as those experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic, changing demographics and other factors) and local real estate conditions (such as oversupply or reduced demand) may have an adverse effect on the value of our investments. A material decline in the demand for real estate in these areas may materially and adversely affect us. Lack of diversification can increase the correlation of non-performance and foreclosure risks to these investments. Our investments in residential whole loans subject us to servicing-related risks, including those associated with foreclosure and liquidation. We rely on third-party servicers to service and manage the mortgages underlying our residential whole loans. The ultimate returns generated by these investments may depend on the quality of the servicer. If a servicer is not vigilant in seeing that borrowers make their required monthly payments, borrowers may be less likely to make these payments, resulting in a higher frequency of default. If a servicer takes longer to liquidate non-performing mortgages, our losses related to those loans may be higher than originally anticipated. Any failure by servicers to service these mortgages and/or to competently manage 14 Table of Contents and dispose of REO properties could negatively impact the value of these investments and our financial performance. In addition, while we have contracted with third-party servicers to carry out the actual servicing of the loans (including all direct interface with the borrowers), for loans that we purchase together with the related servicing rights, we are nevertheless ultimately responsible, vis- -vis the borrowers and state and federal regulators, for ensuring that the loans are serviced in accordance with the terms of the related notes and mortgages and applicable law and regulation. (See the Risk Factor captioned Regulatory Risk and Risks Related to the Investment Company Act of 1940 - Our business is subject to extensive regulation .) In light of the current regulatory environment, such exposure could be significant even though we might have contractual claims against our servicers for any failure to service the loans to the required standard. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic disruption it has caused may result in liquidity pressures on servicers and other third-party vendors that we rely upon. For instance, as a result of an increase in mortgagors requesting relief in the form of forbearance plans and/or other loss mitigation, servicers and other parties responsible in capital markets securitization transactions for funding advances with respect to delinquent mortgagor payments of principal and interest may begin to experience financial difficulties if mortgagors do not make monthly payments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The negative impact on the business and operations of such servicers or other parties responsible for funding such advances could be significant. Sources of liquidity typically available to servicers and other relevant parties for the purpose of funding advances of monthly mortgage payments, especially entities that are not depository institutions, may not be sufficient to meet the increased need that could result from significantly higher delinquency and/or forbearance rates. The extent of such liquidity pressures in the future is not known at this time and is subject to continual change. The foreclosure process, especially in judicial foreclosure states such as New York, Florida and New Jersey (in which states we have significant exposure), can be lengthy and expensive, and the delays and costs involved in completing a foreclosure, and then subsequently liquidating the REO property through sale, may materially increase any related loss. In addition, at such time as title is taken to a foreclosed property, it may require more extensive rehabilitation than we estimated at acquisition. Thus, a material amount of foreclosed residential mortgage loans, particularly in the states mentioned above, could result in significant losses in our residential whole loan portfolio and could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were various federal, state, and local laws, regulations, orders, and ordinances limiting foreclosure and eviction remedies. On August 26, 2021, the United States Supreme Court declared unconstitutional an executive order issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (or CDC) and so it is no longer in effect. The Supreme Court ruling does not affect or preclude state and local jurisdictions from issuing orders stopping or limiting evictions and foreclosures in an effort to lessen the financial burden created by COVID-19 in their jurisdictions, and certain jurisdictions have pursued, and may continue to pursue, such limitations. Any such limitations could adversely impact the cash flow on those investments. The expanding body of federal, state and local regulations and investigations of mortgage loan originators and servicers may increase costs of compliance and the risks of noncompliance, and may adversely affect servicers ability to perform their servicing obligations. We work with and rely on third-party servicers to service the residential mortgage loans that we acquire through consolidated trusts. The mortgages underlying the MBS that we acquire are also serviced by third-party servicers that have been hired by the bond issuers. The mortgage servicing business is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities and is subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions and increased compliance costs on a substantial portion of their operations. The volume of new or modified laws and regulations has increased in recent years and the regulators have identified mortgage loan servicing as an enforcement priority. Some jurisdictions and municipalities have enacted laws that restrict loan servicing activities, including delaying or preventing foreclosures or forcing the modification of certain mortgages. Federal laws and regulations have also been proposed or adopted which, among other things, could hinder the ability of a servicer to foreclose promptly on defaulted residential loans, and which could result in assignees being held responsible for violations in the residential loan origination process. For example, due to regulations arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a federal moratorium against evictions in place until at least August 26, 2021, which limited foreclosure and eviction remedies. In addition, mortgage lenders and third-party servicers have voluntarily, pursuant to federal, state or local regulation, or as part of settlements with law enforcement authorities, established loan modification programs relating to loans they hold or service. These federal, state and local legislative or regulatory actions that result in modifications of our outstanding mortgages, or interests in mortgages acquired by us either directly through consolidated trusts or through our investments in residential MBS, may adversely affect the value of, and returns on, such investments. Mortgage servicers may be incented by the federal government to pursue such loan modifications, as well as forbearance plans and other actions intended to prevent foreclosure, even if such loan modifications and other actions are not in the best interests of the beneficial owners of the mortgages. As a 15 Table of Contents consequence of the foregoing matters, our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay dividends, if any, to our stockholders may be adversely affected. Our ability to sell REO on terms acceptable to us or at all may be limited. REO properties are illiquid relative to other assets we own. Furthermore, real estate markets are affected by many factors that are beyond our control, such as general and local economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and supply and demand. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any REO for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of an REO. In certain circumstances, we may be required to expend cash to correct defects, pay expenses or to make improvements before a property can be sold, and we cannot assure that we will have cash available to make these payments. As a result, our ownership of REOs could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. Our investments in MSR-related assets expose us to additional risks. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $153.8 million of investments in financial instruments whose cash flows are considered to be largely dependent on underlying MSRs that either directly or indirectly act as collateral for the investment. Generally, we have the right to receive certain cash flows from the owner of the MSRs that are generated from the servicing fees and/or excess servicing spread associated with the MSRs. While we do not directly own MSRs, our investments in MSR-related assets indirectly expose us to risks associated with MSRs, such as the illiquidity of MSRs, the risks associated with servicing MSRs (that include, for example, significant regulatory risks and costs) and the ability of the owner to successfully manage its MSR portfolio. Furthermore, the value of MSRs is highly sensitive to changes in prepayment rates. Decreasing market interest rates are generally associated with increases in prepayment rates as borrowers are able to refinance their loans at lower costs. Prepayments result in the partial or complete loss of the cash flows from the related MSR. If these or other MSR-related risks come to fruition, the value of our MSR-related assets could decline significantly. Our investments in mortgage loan originators expose us to additional risks. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $71.7 million of non-controlling investments in certain loan originators from whom we acquire mortgage loans for investment on a periodic basis. These investments have taken the form of common equity and preferred equity. Unlike our investments in residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, our investments in loan originators are unsecured and not collateralized by any property of the originators. In addition, we do not manage any of the loan originators in which we have made investments, and because none of our investments give us a controlling stake in any of the loan originators, our ability to influence the business and operations of the originators is limited, in some instances significantly so. Also, because these loan originators are private closely-held enterprises, there are significant restrictions on our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our investments (which are generally illiquid). In the event one or more of the loan originators in which we have made investments should experience a significant decline in its business and operations or otherwise not be able to respond adequately to managerial, compliance or operational challenges that it may encounter, we may be required to write-down all or a portion of the applicable investment, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Lima One acquisition. On July 1, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Lima One. The long-term success of the acquisition will depend on, among other things, our ability to continue to combine the businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities (in particular, growth in our business purpose loan portfolio). Ultimately, we might not successfully combine the businesses in a manner that permits the benefits of the acquisition to be realized, including any anticipated growth. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of our common stock may be adversely impacted. In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. Actual growth (particularly as related to our business purpose loan portfolio), if achieved, may be lower than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. Additionally, at times the attention of our management may be focused on the integration of the businesses and diverted from day-to-day business operations or other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us. 16 Table of Contents Business purpose loans involve a high degree of business and financial risk. Our operations and activities include business purpose loans originated by Lima One. These business purpose loans include short-term loans that are collateralized by 1-4 family residential properties and made to non-occupant borrowers who intend to rehabilitate and sell the property for a profit, as well as long-term mortgage loans made to investors who intend to rent such properties to generate income. Such a borrower ability to repay its loan may be adversely impacted by numerous factors, including negative local or more general economic conditions and, in the case of rehabilitation loans, the borrower ability to complete the rehabilitation successfully, on budget and on time. In addition, in the case of mortgage loans secured by rental properties, if tenants who rent their residence from a business purpose loan borrower are unable to make rental payments, are unwilling to make rental payments, or a waiver of the requirement to make rental payments on a timely basis, or at all, is available under the terms of any applicable forbearance or waiver agreement or program (which rental payment forbearance or waiver program may be available as a result of a government-sponsored or government-imposed program or under any such agreement or program a landlord may otherwise offer to tenants), then the value of business purpose loans we own will likely be impaired, potentially materially. Accordingly, deterioration in a borrower financial condition and prospects may be accompanied by deterioration in the collateral for the loan. Additionally, as rehabilitation mortgage loans involve properties in transition, they may involve a greater risk of loss than traditional mortgage loans. This type of loan is typically used for acquiring and rehabilitating or improving the quality of single-family residential investment properties and generally serves as an interim financing solution for borrowers and/or properties prior to the borrower selling the property or stabilizing the property and obtaining long-term permanent financing. The typical borrower of these mortgage loans has often identified an undervalued asset that has been under-managed or is located in a recovering market. If the market in which the asset is located fails to improve according to the borrower projections, or if the borrower fails to improve the quality of the asset management or the value of the asset, the borrower may not receive a sufficient return on the asset to satisfy the transitional loan, and we bear the risk that we may not recover some or all of our investment. In addition, borrowers may use the proceeds of a conventional mortgage to repay a mortgage loan of this type. These loans therefore are subject to risks of a borrower inability to obtain permanent financing to repay the rehabilitation loan. Similar to other mortgage loans that we hold for investment, business purpose loans are also subject to risks of borrower defaults, bankruptcies, fraud and other losses. Accordingly, we bear the risk of loss of principal and non-payment of interest and fees to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the mortgage collateral and the principal amount and unpaid interest of the loan. To the extent we suffer such losses with respect to these loans, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Moreover, although the loans originated by Lima One are business purpose loans, they are still subject to substantial state and federal regulation including around origination, underwriting, licensure, and servicing. Should Lima One experience a significant decline in its business and operations or otherwise not be able to respond adequately to managerial, compliance or operational challenges that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Prepayment and Reinvestment Risk Prepayment rates on the mortgage loans underlying certain of our residential mortgage assets may materially adversely affect our profitability or could require us to sell assets in unfavorable market conditions. In general, the mortgages collateralizing certain of our residential mortgage assets may be prepaid at any time without penalty. Prepayments result when borrowers satisfy (i.e., pay off) the mortgage upon selling or refinancing their mortgaged property. When we acquire assets collateralized by residential mortgage loans, we anticipate that the underlying mortgage loans will prepay at a projected rate which, together with expected coupon income, provides us with an expected yield on that asset. If we purchase an asset at a premium to par value, and borrowers then prepay the underlying mortgage loans at a faster rate than we expect, the increased prepayments would result in a yield lower than expected on such assets because we would be required to amortize the related premium on an accelerated basis. Conversely, if we purchase residential mortgage assets at a discount to par value, and borrowers then prepay the underlying mortgage loans at a slower rate than we expect, the decreased prepayments would result in a lower yield than expected on the asset and/or may result in a decline in the fair value of the asset, which would result in losses if the asset is accounted for at fair value or impairment for an AFS security if the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost. 17 Table of Contents Prepayment rates on mortgage loans are influenced by changes in mortgage and market interest rates and a variety of economic, geographic, governmental and other factors beyond our control. Consequently, prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty and no strategy can completely insulate us from prepayment risks. In periods of declining interest rates, prepayment rates on mortgage loans generally increase. Because of prepayment risk, the market value of certain of our assets may benefit less than other fixed income securities from a decline in interest rates. If general interest rates decline at the same time, we would likely not be able to reinvest the proceeds of the prepayments that we receive in assets yielding as much as those yields on the assets that were prepaid. With respect to certain residential mortgage assets, we have, at times, purchased assets that have a higher coupon rate than the prevailing market interest rates. In exchange for a higher coupon rate, we typically pay a premium over par value to acquire such assets. In accordance with GAAP, we amortize premiums over the life of the related asset. If the underlying mortgage loans securing these assets prepay at a more rapid rate than anticipated, we will be required to amortize the related premiums on an accelerated basis, which could adversely affect our profitability. Risks Related to Our Use of Leverage Our business strategy involves the use of leverage, and we may not achieve what we believe to be optimal levels of leverage or we may become overleveraged, which may materially adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations or financial condition. Our business strategy involves the use of borrowing or leverage. We use the borrowed funds to finance our investment portfolio and the acquisition of additional investment assets. Although we are not required to maintain any particular debt-to-equity ratio, certain of our borrowing agreements contain provisions requiring us not to have a debt-to-equity ratio exceeding specified levels. Future increases in the amount by which the collateral value is required to contractually exceed the repurchase transaction loan amount, decreases in the market value of our residential mortgage investments, increases in interest rate volatility and changes in the availability of acceptable financing could cause us to be unable to achieve the amount of leverage we believe to be optimal. The return on our assets and cash available for distribution to our stockholders may be reduced to the extent that changes in market conditions prevent us from achieving the desired amount of leverage on our investments or cause the cost of our financing to increase relative to the income earned on our leveraged assets. If the interest income on the residential mortgage investments that we have purchased with borrowed funds fails to cover the interest expense of the related borrowings, we will experience net interest losses and may experience net losses from operations. Such losses could be significant as a result of our leveraged structure. The risks associated with leverage are more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession, which the U.S. economy experienced in connection with the conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of leverage to finance our residential mortgage investments involves a number of other risks, including, among other things, the following: If we are unable to renew our borrowings at acceptable interest rates, it may force us to sell assets under adverse market conditions, which may materially adversely affect our liquidity and profitability. Since a portion of our borrowings to finance longer-term residential mortgage investments are under short-term repurchase agreements, our ability to achieve our investment objectives depends on our ability to borrow funds in sufficient amounts and on acceptable terms, and on our ability to renew or replace maturing borrowings on a continuous basis. Our repurchase agreement credit lines are renewable at the discretion of our lenders and, as such, do not contain guaranteed roll-over terms. Our ability to enter into repurchase transactions in the future will depend on the market value of our residential mortgage investments pledged to secure the specific borrowings, the availability of acceptable financing and market liquidity and other conditions existing in the lending market at that time. If we are not able to renew or replace maturing borrowings, we could be forced to sell assets, including assets in an unrealized loss position, in order to maintain liquidity. Forced sales, particularly under adverse market conditions, as frequently occurred during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in lower sales prices than ordinary market sales made in the normal course of business. If our residential mortgage investments were liquidated at prices below our amortized cost (i.e., the cost basis) of such assets, we would incur losses, which could materially adversely affect our earnings. A decline in the market value of our assets may result in margin calls that may force us to sell assets under adverse market conditions, which may materially adversely affect our liquidity and profitability. In general, the market value of our residential mortgage investments is impacted by changes in interest rates, prevailing market yields and other market conditions, including general economic conditions, home prices and the real estate market generally. A decline in the market value of our residential mortgage investments may limit our ability to borrow against such assets or result in lenders initiating margin calls, which require a pledge of additional collateral or cash to re-establish the required ratio of borrowing to collateral value, under our repurchase agreements. For example, during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and related market dislocations, we experienced significantly higher margin calls and 18 Table of Contents haircuts with respect to our repurchase agreements. Posting additional collateral or cash to support our credit will reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to leverage our assets, which could materially adversely affect our business. As a result, we could be forced to sell a portion of our assets, including MBS in an unrealized loss position, in order to maintain liquidity. Adverse developments involving major financial institutions or involving one of our lenders could result in a rapid reduction in our ability to borrow and materially adversely affect our business, profitability and liquidity. A material adverse development involving one or more major financial institutions or the financial markets in general could result in our lenders reducing our access to funds available under our repurchase agreements or terminating such repurchase agreements altogether. Because all of our repurchase agreements are uncommitted and renewable at the discretion of our lenders, our lenders could determine to reduce or terminate our access to future borrowings at virtually any time, which could materially adversely affect our business and profitability. Furthermore, if a number of our lenders became unwilling or unable to continue to provide us with financing, we could be forced to sell assets , including MBS in an unrealized loss position, in order to maintain liquidity. Forced sales, particularly under adverse market conditions, may result in lower sales prices than ordinary market sales made in the normal course of business. If our residential mortgage investments were liquidated at prices below our amortized cost (i.e., the cost basis) of such assets, we would incur losses, which could adversely affect our earnings. We and many other mortgage REITs experienced these conditions in 2020 in connection with the conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, any uncertainty in the global finance market or weak economic conditions in Europe could cause the conditions described above to have a more pronounced effect on our European counterparties. Our profitability may be materially adversely affected by a reduction in our leverage. As long as we earn a positive spread between interest and other income we earn on our leveraged assets and our borrowing costs, we believe that we can generally increase our profitability by using greater amounts of leverage. There can be no assurance, however, that repurchase financing will remain an efficient source of long-term financing for our assets. The amount of leverage that we use may be limited because our lenders might not make funding available to us at acceptable rates or they may require that we provide additional collateral to secure our borrowings. If our financing strategy is not viable, we will have to find alternative forms of financing for our assets which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at acceptable rates. In addition, in response to certain interest rate and investment environments or to changes in market liquidity, we could adopt a strategy of reducing our leverage by selling assets or not reinvesting principal payments as assets amortize and/or prepay, thereby decreasing the outstanding amount of our related borrowings. Such an action could reduce interest income, interest expense and net income, the extent of which would be dependent on the level of reduction in assets and liabilities as well as the sale prices for which the assets were sold. If a counterparty to our repurchase transactions defaults on its obligation to resell the underlying security back to us at the end of the transaction term or if we default on our obligations under the repurchase agreement, we could incur losses. When we engage in repurchase transactions, we generally transfer securities to lenders (i.e., repurchase agreement counterparties) and receive cash from such lenders. Because the cash we receive from the lender when we initially transfer the securities to the lender is less than the value of those securities (this difference is referred to as the haircut ), if the lender defaults on its obligation to transfer the same securities back to us, we would incur a loss on the transaction equal to the amount of the haircut (assuming there was no change in the value of the securities). Our exposure to defaults by counterparties may be more pronounced during periods of significant volatility in the market conditions for mortgages and mortgage-related assets as well as the broader financial markets. At December 31, 2021, we had greater than 5% stockholders equity at risk to the following financing agreement counterparties: Credit Suisse (approximately 21.9%), Barclay Bank (approximately 21.1%) and Wells Fargo (approximately 9.9%). In addition, generally, if we default on one of our obligations under a repurchase transaction with a particular lender, that lender can elect to terminate the transaction and cease entering into additional repurchase transactions with us. In addition, some of our repurchase agreements contain cross-default provisions, so that if a default occurs under any one agreement, the lenders under our other repurchase agreements could also declare a default. Any losses we incur on our repurchase transactions could materially adversely affect our earnings and thus our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Our use of repurchase agreements to borrow money may give our lenders greater rights in the event of bankruptcy. Borrowings made under repurchase agreements may qualify for special treatment under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. If a lender under one of our repurchase agreements defaults on its obligations, it may be difficult for us to recover our assets pledged as collateral to such lender. In the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of a lender during the term of a repurchase agreement, the lender may be permitted, under applicable insolvency laws, to repudiate the contract, and our claim against the lender for damages may be treated simply as an unsecured creditor. In addition, if the lender is a 19 Table of Contents broker or dealer subject to the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, or an insured depository institution subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950, our ability to exercise our rights to recover our securities under a repurchase agreement or to be compensated for any damages resulting from the lender insolvency may be further limited by those statutes. These claims would be subject to significant delay and, if and when received, may be substantially less than the damages we actually incur. In addition, in the event of our insolvency or bankruptcy, certain repurchase agreements may qualify for special treatment under the Bankruptcy Code, the effect of which, among other things, would be to allow the creditor under the agreement to avoid the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and take possession of, and liquidate, our collateral under our repurchase agreements without delay. Our risks associated with the insolvency or bankruptcy of a lender maybe more pronounced during periods of significant volatility in the market conditions for mortgages and mortgage-related assets as well as the broader financial markets. An increase in our borrowing costs relative to the interest we receive on our investments may materially adversely affect our profitability. Our earnings are primarily generated from the difference between the interest income we earn on our investment portfolio, less net amortization of purchase premiums and discounts, and the interest expense we pay on our borrowings. We rely primarily on borrowings under repurchase agreements and other financing arrangements to finance the acquisition of residential mortgage investments. Our financing arrangements typically have shorter-term contractual maturities than the maturities of our mortgage investments. Even though the majority of our investments have interest rates that adjust over time based on changes in corresponding interest rate indexes, the interest we pay on our borrowings may increase at a faster pace than the interest we earn on our investments. In general, if the interest expense on our borrowings increases relative to the interest income we earn on our investments, our profitability may be materially adversely affected, including due to the following reasons: Changes in interest rates, cyclical or otherwise, may materially adversely affect our profitability. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions, as well as other factors beyond our control. In general, we finance the acquisition of our investments through borrowings in the form of repurchase transactions, which exposes us to interest rate risk on the financed assets. The cost of our borrowings is based on prevailing market interest rates. Because the terms of our repurchase transactions typically range from one to six months at inception, the interest rates on our borrowings generally adjust more frequently (as new repurchase transactions are entered into upon the maturity of existing repurchase transactions) than the interest rates on our investments. During a period of rising interest rates, our borrowing costs generally will increase at a faster pace than our interest earnings on the leveraged portion of our investment portfolio, which could result in a decline in our net interest spread and net interest margin. The severity of any such decline would depend on our asset/liability composition, including the impact of hedging transactions, at the time as well as the magnitude and period over which interest rates increase. Further, an increase in short-term interest rates could also have a negative impact on the market value of our residential mortgage investments. If any of these events happen, we could experience a decrease in net income or incur a net loss during these periods, which may negatively impact our distributions to stockholders. The impact of inflation may adversely affect our financial performance. Inflation by some measures is at the highest readings since 1982, and inflationary pressures have broadened from goods earlier in the pandemic to include shelter costs and a number of labor-intensive services. The rapid acceleration of inflation led to an abrupt shift in the Federal Reserve monetary policy stance as they no longer consider these price pressures to be transitory . Coming into 2021, the consensus view, including within the Federal Reserve, was that tapering of its treasuries and agency RMBS bond buying program would not begin until 2022, with rates unlikely to rise until 2024. The Federal Reserve actually began to taper its bond buying program in November and then doubled the pace of cuts in December 2021. In addition, the recent updated set of Federal Reserve dot projections called for three quarter-point rate hikes in 2022, a significant turnaround in officials policy outlook from earlier in the year. As the Federal Reserve lifts its federal funds target rate, the margin between short and long-term rates could further compress. Given our reliance on short-term borrowings to generate interest income, if the curve continues to flatten or even invert, or if Federal Reserve finds itself falling behind on inflation and more aggressively tightens that their current projections, our results of operations, financial condition and business could be materially adversely impacted. The discontinuation of LIBOR may affect our financial results. The interest rates on our repurchase agreements, as well as adjustable-rate mortgage loans in our securitizations, are generally based on LIBOR. On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (or FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that all LIBOR tenors relevant to us will cease to be published or will no longer be representative after June 20 Table of Contents 30, 2023. The FCA's announcement coincides with the March 5, 2021, announcement of LIBOR's administrator, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (or IBA), indicating that, as a result of not having access to input data necessary to calculate LIBOR tenors relevant to us on a representative basis after June 30, 2023, IBA would have to cease publication of such LIBOR tenors immediately after the last publication on June 30, 2023. These announcements mean that any of our LIBOR-based borrowings that extend beyond June 30, 2023 will need to be converted to a replacement rate. Moreover, any adjustable-rate mortgage loans based upon LIBOR will need to convert by that time too. In the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (or ARRC), a committee of private sector entities with ex-officio official sector members convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (or SOFR) plus a recommended spread adjustment as LIBOR replacement. There are significant differences between LIBOR and SOFR, such as LIBOR being an unsecured lending rate while SOFR is a secured lending rate, and SOFR is an overnight rate while LIBOR reflects term rates at different maturities. If our LIBOR-based borrowings are converted to SOFR, the differences between LIBOR and SOFR, plus the recommended spread adjustment, could result in interest costs that are higher than if LIBOR remained available, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. At December 31, 2021, we had Swaps with an aggregate notional balance of approximately $900.0 million whose interest rates were based on SOFR. Although SOFR is the ARRC's recommended replacement rate, it is also possible that lenders may instead choose alternative replacement rates that may differ from LIBOR in ways similar to SOFR or in other ways that would result in higher interest costs for us. Furthermore, lenders may select alternative rates sooner than June 30, 2023, either in amendments to existing facilities or as we decide to enter into new facilities. It is possible that not all of our assets and liabilities will transition away from LIBOR at the same time, and it is possible that not all of our assets and liabilities will transition to the same alternative reference rate, in each case increasing the difficulty of hedging. We and other market participants have less experience understanding and modeling SOFR-based assets and liabilities than LIBOR-based assets and liabilities, increasing the difficulty of investing, hedging, and risk management. The process of transition involves operational risks. It is not yet possible to predict the magnitude of LIBOR's end on our borrowing costs and other operations given the remaining uncertainty about which rates will replace LIBOR and the related timing. Holders of our fixed-to-floating preferred shares should refer to the relevant prospectus to understand the USD-LIBOR cessation provisions applicable to that class. We do not currently intend to amend any of our fixed-to-floating preferred shares to change the existing USD-LIBOR cessation fallbacks. Our fixed-to-floating preferred shares become callable at the same time they begin to pay a USD-LIBOR-based rate. Should we choose to call our fixed-to-floating preferred shares in order to avoid a dispute over the results of the USD-LIBOR fallbacks, we may be forced to raise additional funds at an unfavorable time. Certain of our current lenders require, and future lenders may require, that we enter into restrictive covenants relating to our operations. The various agreements pursuant to which we borrow money to finance our residential mortgage investments generally include customary representations, warranties and covenants, but may also contain more restrictive supplemental terms and conditions. Although specific to each master repurchase or loan agreement, typical supplemental terms include requirements of minimum equity, leverage ratios and performance triggers relating to a decline in equity or net income over a period of time. If we fail to meet or satisfy any covenants, supplemental terms or representations and warranties, we could be in default under the affected agreements and those lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the agreements to be immediately due and payable, enforce their respective interests against collateral pledged under such agreements and restrict our ability to make additional borrowings. Certain of our financing agreements contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, so that if a default or acceleration of indebtedness occurs under any one agreement, the lenders under our other agreements could also declare a default. Further, under our repurchase agreements, we are typically required to pledge additional assets to our lenders in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral, which may take the form of additional securities, loans or cash. Future lenders may impose similar or additional restrictions and other covenants on us. If we fail to meet or satisfy any of these covenants, we could be in default under these agreements, and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable, require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their interests against then-existing collateral. We could also be subject to cross-default and acceleration rights and, with respect to collateralized debt, the posting of additional collateral and foreclosure rights upon default. Further, this could also make it difficult for us to satisfy the qualification requirements necessary to maintain our status as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 21 Table of Contents The use of non-recourse long-term financing structures expose us to risks, which could result in losses to us. We use securitization financing for certain of our residential whole loan investments. In such structures, our financing sources typically have only a claim against the special purpose vehicle which we sponsor rather than a general claim against us. Prior to any such financing, we generally seek to finance our investments with relatively short-term repurchase agreements until a sufficient portfolio of assets is accumulated. As a result, we are subject to the risk that we would not be able to acquire, during the period that any short-term repurchase agreements are available, sufficient eligible assets or securities to maximize the efficiency of a securitization. We also bear the risk that we would not be able to obtain new short-term repurchase agreements or would not be able to renew any short-term repurchase agreements after they expire should we need more time to seek and acquire sufficient eligible assets or securities for a securitization. In addition, conditions in the capital markets may make the issuance of any such securitization less attractive to us even when we do have sufficient eligible assets or securities. While we would generally intend to retain a portion of the interests issued under such securitizations and, therefore, still have exposure to any investments included in such securitizations, our inability to enter into such securitizations may increase our overall exposure to risks associated with direct ownership of such investments, including the risk of default. If we are unable to obtain and renew short-term repurchase agreements or to consummate securitizations to finance the selected investments on a long-term basis, we may be required to seek other forms of potentially less attractive financing or to liquidate assets at an inopportune time or price. These financing arrangements require us to make certain representations and warranties regarding the assets that collateralize the borrowings. Although we perform due diligence on the assets that we acquire, certain representations and warranties that we make in respect of such assets may ultimately be determined to be inaccurate. Such representations and warranties may include, but are not limited to, issues such as the validity of the lien; the absence of delinquent taxes or other liens; the loans compliance with all local, state and federal laws and the delivery of all documents required to perfect title to the lien. In the event of a breach of a representation or warranty, we may be required to repurchase affected loans, make indemnification payments to certain indemnified parties or address any claims associated with such breach. Further, we may have limited or no recourse against the seller from whom we purchased the loans. Such recourse may be limited due to a variety of factors, including the absence of a representation or warranty from the seller corresponding to the representation provided by us or the contractual expiration thereof. A breach of a representation or warranty could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. Certain of our financing arrangements are rated by one or more rating agencies and we may sponsor financing facilities in the future that are rated by credit agencies. The related agency or rating agencies may suspend rating notes at any time. Rating agency delays may result in our inability to obtain timely ratings on new notes, which could adversely impact the availability of borrowings or the interest rates, advance rates or other financing terms and adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. Further, if we are unable to secure ratings from other agencies, limited investor demand for unrated notes could result in further adverse changes to our liquidity and profitability. Risks Associated with Adverse Developments in the Mortgage Finance and Credit Markets and Financial Markets Generally Market conditions for mortgages and mortgage-related assets as well as the broader financial markets may materially adversely affect the value of the assets in which we invest. Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the markets for mortgages and mortgage-related assets, including MBS, as well as the broader financial markets and the economy generally. Significant adverse changes in financial market conditions, such as those experienced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the forced sale of large quantities of mortgage-related and other financial assets would result in significant volatility in the market for mortgages and mortgage-related assets and potentially significant losses for ourselves and certain other market participants. In addition, concerns over actual or anticipated low economic growth rates, higher levels of unemployment or uncertainty regarding future U.S. monetary policy may contribute to increased interest rate volatility. Declines in the value of our investments, or perceived market uncertainty about their value, may make it difficult for us to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all, or maintain our compliance with terms of any financing arrangements already in place. Additionally, increased volatility and/or deterioration in the broader residential mortgage and MBS markets could materially adversely affect the performance and market value of our investments. 22 Table of Contents A lack of liquidity in our investments may materially adversely affect our business. The assets that comprise our investment portfolio and that we acquire are not traded on an exchange. A portion of our investments are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale and are otherwise generally less liquid than exchange-traded securities. Any illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need or desire arises. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, as frequently occurred during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of 2020, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments. Further, we may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a business entity to the extent that we have or could be attributed with material, non-public information regarding such business entity. As a result, our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be relatively limited, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Actions by the U.S. Government designed to stabilize or reform the financial markets may not achieve their intended effect or otherwise benefit our business, and could materially adversely affect our business. Our business is heavily regulated. In July 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act, in part to impose significant investment restrictions and capital requirements on banking entities and other organizations that are significant to U.S. financial markets. For instance, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes significant restrictions on the proprietary trading activities of certain banking entities and subjects other systemically significant entities and activities regulated by the Federal Reserve to increased capital requirements and quantitative limits for engaging in such activities. The Dodd-Frank Act also seeks to reform the asset-backed securitization market (including the MBS market) by requiring the retention of a portion of the credit risk inherent in the pool of securitized assets and by imposing additional registration and disclosure requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act also imposes significant regulatory restrictions on the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans. The Dodd-Frank Act extensive requirements, and implementation by regulatory agencies such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (or CFTC), CFPB, FDIC, Federal Reserve, and the SEC may have a significant effect on the financial markets, and may affect the availability or terms of financing, derivatives or MBS, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Federal consumer protection laws and regulations regulate residential mortgage loan underwriting and originators lending processes, standards, and disclosures to borrowers. These laws and regulations include, among others, the CFPB ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage regulations. In addition, there are various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations that are intended to discourage predatory lending practices by residential mortgage loan originators. For example, the federal Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (or HOEPA), which was expanded under the Dodd Frank Act, prohibits inclusion of certain provisions in residential mortgage loans that have mortgage rates or origination costs in excess of prescribed levels and requires that borrowers be given certain disclosures prior to origination. Business purpose loans secured by 1-4 family residences are also subject to federal and state regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act grants enforcement authority and broad discretionary regulatory authority to the CFPB to prohibit or condition terms, acts or practices relating to mortgage loans that the CFPB finds abusive, unfair, deceptive or predatory, as well as to take other actions that the CFPB finds are necessary or proper to ensure responsible affordable mortgage credit remains available to consumers. The Dodd-Frank Act also affects the securitization of mortgages (and other assets) with requirements for risk retention by securitizers and requirements for regulating rating agencies. Numerous regulations have been issued pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, including regulations regarding mortgage loan servicing, underwriting and loan originator compensation and others could be issued in the future. These requirements can and do change as statutes and regulations are enacted, promulgated, amended, and interpreted, and the recent trends among federal and state lawmakers and regulators have been toward increasing laws, regulations, and investigative procedures concerning the mortgage industry generally. As a result, we are unable to fully predict at this time how the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as other laws or regulations that may be adopted in the future, will affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the environment for repurchase financing and other forms of borrowing, the investing environment for Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS and/or residential mortgage loans, origination of business purpose loans secured by 1-4 family residential property, and the securitization industry. We believe that the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder are likely to continue to increase the economic and compliance costs for participants in the mortgage origination and securitization industries, including us. Some states have enacted, or may enact, similar laws or regulations, which in some cases may impose restrictions and requirements greater than those in place under federal laws and regulations. In addition, under the anti-predatory lending laws of some states, the origination of certain residential mortgage loans, including loans that are classified as high cost loans under applicable law, must satisfy a net tangible benefits test with respect to the borrower. This test, as well as certain standards set forth in the ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage regulations, may be highly subjective and open to interpretation. As a result, a court may determine that a residential mortgage loan did not meet the applicable standard or test even if the originator reasonably believed such standard or test had been satisfied. Failure of residential mortgage loan originators or servicers to 23 Table of Contents comply with federal consumer protection laws and regulations could subject us, or as an assignee or purchaser of these loans (or as an investor in securities backed by these loans), to monetary penalties and defenses to foreclosure, including by recoupment or setoff of damages and costs, which for some violations includes the sum of all finance charges and fees paid by the consumer, and could result in rescission of the affected residential mortgage loans, which could adversely impact our business and financial results. Similarly, with respect to any mortgage loan that we originate, any failure by us or servicers to comply with federal or state laws and regulations could subject us, or an assignee or purchaser of these loans (to the extent that we sell them to an investor in securities backed by these loans), to monetary penalties and defenses to foreclosure, including by recoupment or setoff of damages and costs, which for some violations includes the sum of all finance charges and fees paid by the borrower, and could result in rescission of the affected residential mortgage loans, which could adversely impact our business and financial results. In addition, the U.S. Government, the Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury and other governmental and regulatory bodies have increased focus and scrutiny on our industry. New proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of our industry, impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of compensation, interest rates, financial product offerings and disclosures, and have an effect on bankruptcy proceedings with respect to consumer residential real estate mortgages, among other things. International financial regulators are examining standard setting for systemically significant entities, such as those considered by the Third Basel Accords (Basel III) to be incorporated by domestic entities. We cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur or what effect, if any, such actions could have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Federal Reserve announced in November 2008 a program of large-scale purchases of Agency MBS in an attempt to lower longer-term interest rates and contribute to an overall easing of adverse financial conditions. Subject to specified investment guidelines, the portfolios of Agency MBS purchased through the programs established by the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve may be held to maturity and, based on mortgage market conditions, adjustments may be made to these portfolios. This flexibility may adversely affect the pricing and availability of Agency MBS during the remaining term of these portfolios. Various regulatory measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic affect mortgage servicing and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, on March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. Among the provisions in this wide-ranging law are protections for homeowners experiencing financial difficulties due to COVID-19, including forbearance provisions and procedures. Borrowers with federally backed mortgage loans, regardless of delinquency status, were permitted to request loan forbearance for a six-month period, with the option to extend forbearance for another six-month period if necessary. The CARES Act also modified the manner in which accounts subject to financial accommodation are reported to consumer reporting agencies. Although the initial deadline to request forbearance on federally backed loans was set to expire under the CARES Act on December 31, 2020, FHFA and CFPB announced extensions of several measures to align COVID-19 mortgage relief policies across the federal government, including additional three-month extensions of COVID-19 forbearance or payment deferral options for certain borrowers. Federally backed mortgage loans are loans secured by first- or subordinate-liens on 1-4 family residential real property, including individual units of condominiums and cooperatives, which are insured or guaranteed pursuant to certain government housing programs, such as by the Federal Housing Administration or U.S. Department of Agriculture, or are purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The CARES Act also included a temporary 60-day foreclosure moratorium that applied to federally backed mortgage loans, which lasted until July 24, 2020. However, the foreclosure moratorium was extended several times to July 31, 2021 and the forbearance enrollment window was extended through September 30, 2021 by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Agriculture and FHFA, which includes mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Although the federal foreclosure moratorium expired, various states and local jurisdictions also imposed foreclosure moratoriums, some of which will still be in effect after the federal moratorium expires. On July 30, 2021, FHFA announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were extending the moratorium on single-family real estate owned (REO) evictions until September 30, 2021. The Biden Administration may pass additional stimulus bills, foreclosure relief measures and may reinstate foreclosure and eviction moratoriums that may continue to adversely impact the cash flow on mortgage loans. The CFPB has announced that it is carefully monitoring conditions in the mortgage market and taking steps to minimize avoidable foreclosures and address any compliance failures, including by conducting prioritized assessments, or targeted supervisory reviews, designed to obtain real-time information from mortgage services due to the elevated risk of consumer harm because of the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 28, 2021, the CFPB finalized amendments to the federal mortgage servicing regulations designed support the housing market transition to post-pandemic operation. The rules established temporary special safeguards to help ensure that borrowers have time before foreclosure to explore their options, including loan modifications and selling their homes. The rules cover loans on principal residences, generally exclude small servicers, and took effect on August 31, 2021. On November 10, 2021, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the CFPB, the FDIC, 24 Table of Contents the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the state financial regulators (collectively, agencies) announced that they were discontinuing the more flexible supervisory approach announced in April 2020, concluding that servicers have had sufficient time to adjust their operations by, among other things, taking steps to work with consumers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and developing more robust business continuity and remote work capabilities. CFPB December 2021 Supervisory Highlights show, among other things, that CFPB is prioritizing compliance with Regulation Z and Regulation X, as well as unfair and deceptive acts or practices prohibited by the CFPB. This enhanced scrutiny is likely to continue to increase the economic and compliance costs for participants in the mortgage and securitization industries, including us. Regulatory Risk and Risks Related to the Investment Company Act of 1940 Our business is subject to extensive regulation. Our business is subject to extensive regulation by federal and state governmental authorities, self-regulatory organizations and securities exchanges. We are required to comply with numerous federal and state laws. The laws, rules and regulations comprising this regulatory framework change frequently, as can the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws, rules and regulations. Some of the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject are intended primarily to safeguard and protect consumers, rather than stockholders or creditors. From time to time, we may receive requests from federal and state agencies for records, documents and information regarding our policies, procedures and practices regarding our business activities. We incur significant ongoing costs to comply with these government regulations. Although we do not directly service residential mortgage loans (except for business purpose loans originated and serviced by Lima One), we must comply with various federal and state laws, rules and regulations as a result of owning MBS and residential whole loans. These rules generally focus on consumer protection and include, among others, rules promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (or Gramm-Leach-Bliley). These requirements can and do change as statutes and regulations are enacted, promulgated, amended and interpreted, and the recent trend among federal and state lawmakers and regulators has been toward increasing laws, regulations and investigative proceedings in relation to the mortgage industry generally. For example, on December 10, 2020, the CFPB issued a final rule that adopts a set of bright-line loan pricing thresholds to replace the previous General Qualified Mortgage 43% debt-to-income threshold calculated in accordance with Appendix Q and removes Appendix Q (or General QM Final Rule). The effective date of the General QM Final Rule was March 1, 2021, and the mandatory compliance date was July 1, 2021. On December 10, 2020, the CFPB also issued a final rule that creates a new category of a qualified mortgage, referred to as a Seasoned QM (or Seasoned QM Final Rule). A loan is eligible to become a Seasoned QM if it is a first-lien, fixed rate loans that meets certain performance requirements over a seasoning period of 36 months, is held in portfolio until the end of the seasoning period by the originating creditor or first purchaser, complies with general restrictions on product features and points and fees, and meets certain underwriting requirements. The effective date for the Seasoned QM Final Rule was March 1, 2021. At this time, however, there can be no assurance what impact these final rules will have on the mortgage market and the ability-to-repay rules. Furthermore, the temporary qualified mortgage provision applicable to certain mortgage loans eligible for purchase or guarantee by the GSEs under the ability-to-repay, commonly referred to as the GSE Patch, was scheduled to expire on the earlier of (i) the mandatory compliance date of the final rule amending the general qualified mortgage definition described above (July 1, 2021) or (ii) the date that the GSEs exit conservatorship. On April 27, 2021, the CFPB issued a final rule extending the mandatory compliance date of the General Qualified Mortgage Rule to October 1, 2022. It similarly extends expiration of the GSE patch to October 1, 2022 or the date the applicable GSE exits conservatorship, whichever happens first. We cannot predict the impact of its expiration on the mortgage market. Although we believe that we have structured our operations and investments to comply with existing legal and regulatory requirements and interpretations, changes in regulatory and legal requirements, including changes in their interpretation and enforcement by lawmakers and regulators, could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Maintaining our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act imposes significant limits on our operations. We conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer total assets (exclusive of U.S. 25 Table of Contents Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis (i.e., the 40% Test). Excluded from the term investment securities, among other things, are U.S. Government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company for private funds set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. We are a holding company and conduct our real estate business primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries. We conduct our real estate business so that we do not come within the definition of an investment company because less than 40% of the value of our adjusted total assets on an unconsolidated basis will consist of investment securities. The securities issued by any wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries that we may form in the future that are excepted from the definition of investment company based on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, together with any other investment securities we may own, may not have a value in excess of 40% of the value of our adjusted total assets on an unconsolidated basis. We monitor our holdings to ensure continuing and ongoing compliance with the 40% Test. This requirement limits the types of businesses in which we may engage through our subsidiaries. In addition, the assets we and our subsidiaries may acquire are limited by the provisions of the Investment Company Act, the rules and regulations promulgated under the Investment Company Act and SEC staff interpretative guidance, which may adversely affect our performance. In addition, we believe we will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because we will not engage primarily or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we will be primarily engaged in the non-investment company businesses of these subsidiaries. If the value of securities issued by our subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of investment company by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, together with any other investment securities we own, exceeds 40% of our adjusted total assets on an unconsolidated basis, or if one or more of such subsidiaries fail to maintain an exception or exemption from the Investment Company Act, we could, among other things, be required either (a) to substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company, (b) to effect sales of our assets in a manner that, or at a time when, we would not otherwise choose to do so or (c) to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, any of which could have an adverse effect on us and the market price of our securities. If we were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration, and other matters. We expect that our subsidiaries that invest in residential mortgage loans (whether through a consolidated trust or otherwise) will rely upon the exemption from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, which is available for entities primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate. This exemption generally requires that at least 55% of each of these subsidiaries assets be comprised of qualifying real estate assets and at least 80% of each of their portfolios be comprised of qualifying real estate assets and real estate-related assets under the Investment Company Act. Mortgage loans that were fully and exclusively secured by real property are generally qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the exemption. All or substantially all of our residential mortgage loans are fully and exclusively secured by real property with a loan-to-value ratio of less than 100%. As a result, we believe our residential mortgage loans that are fully and exclusively secured by real property meet the definition of qualifying real estate assets. To the extent we own any residential mortgage loans with a loan-to-value ratio of greater than 100%, we intend to classify, depending on guidance from the SEC staff, only the portion of the value of such loans that does not exceed the value of the real estate collateral as qualifying real estate assets and the excess as real estate-related assets. If the SEC determines that any of a subsidiary securities are not qualifying real estate assets or real estate related assets or otherwise believes such subsidiary does not satisfy the exemption under Section 3(c)(5)(C), we could be required to restructure our activities or sell certain of our assets. In August 2011, the SEC issued a concept release pursuant to which they solicited public comments on a wide range of issues relating to companies engaged in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage-related instruments and that rely on Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. The concept release and the public comments thereto have not yet resulted in SEC rulemaking or interpretative guidance and we cannot predict what form any such rulemaking or interpretive guidance may take. There can be no assurance, however, that the laws and regulations governing the Investment Company Act status of REITs, or guidance from the SEC or its staff regarding the exemption from registration as an investment company on which we rely, will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. We expect each of our subsidiaries relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C) to rely on guidance published by the SEC staff or on our analyses of guidance published with respect to other types of assets, if any, to determine which assets are qualifying real estate assets and real estate-related assets. The potential outcomes of the SEC actions are unclear as is the SEC timetable for its review and actions. To the extent that the SEC staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to adjust our strategy accordingly. In 26 Table of Contents addition, we may be limited in our ability to make certain investments and these limitations could result in us holding assets we might wish to sell or selling assets we might wish to hold. Certain of our subsidiaries that hold residential mortgage loans through majority owned subsidiaries may rely on the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(6), which excludes from the definition of investment company any company primarily engaged, directly or through majority-owned subsidiaries, in a business, among others, described in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act (from which not less than 25% of such company gross income during its last fiscal year was derived) together with an additional business or additional businesses other than investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities. The SEC staff has issued little interpretive guidance with respect to Section 3(c)(6) and any guidance published by the staff could require us to adjust our strategy accordingly. To the extent that the SEC staff provides more specific guidance regarding any of the matters bearing upon the exemptions or exceptions from registration under the Investment Company Act that we and our subsidiaries rely on, we may be required to adjust our strategy accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could further inhibit our ability to pursue the strategies we have chosen. If we fail to qualify for exemption from registration as an investment company, our ability to use leverage would be substantially reduced, and we would not be able to conduct our business as described. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the Investment Company Act status of REITs, including guidance regarding these exemptions from the Division of Investment Management of the SEC, will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. Risks Related to Our Use of Hedging Strategies Our use of hedging strategies to mitigate our interest rate exposure may not be effective. In accordance with our operating policies, we may pursue various types of hedging strategies, including Swaps, to seek to mitigate or reduce our exposure to losses from adverse changes in interest rates. Our hedging activity will vary in scope based on the level and volatility of interest rates, the type of assets held and financing sources used and other changing market conditions. No hedging strategy, however, can completely insulate us from the interest rate risks to which we are exposed and there is no guarantee that the implementation of any hedging strategy would have the desired impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Certain of the U.S. federal income tax requirements that we must satisfy in order to qualify as a REIT may limit our ability to hedge against such risks. We will not enter into derivative transactions if we believe that they will jeopardize our qualification as a REIT. Interest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because, among other things: interest rate hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates; available interest rate hedges may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought; the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related hedged instrument; the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction; and the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay. We primarily use Swaps to hedge against future increases in interest rates on our financing agreements. Should a Swap counterparty be unable to make required payments pursuant to such Swap, the hedged liability would cease to be hedged for the remaining term of the Swap. In addition, we may be at risk for any collateral held by a hedging counterparty to a Swap, should such counterparty become insolvent or file for bankruptcy. Our hedging transactions, which are intended to limit losses, may actually adversely affect our earnings, which could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 27 Table of Contents We may enter into hedging instruments that could expose us to contingent liabilities in the future, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, part of our financing strategy involves entering into hedging instruments that could require us to fund cash payments in certain circumstances (e.g., the early termination of a hedging instrument caused by an event of default or other voluntary or involuntary termination event or the decision by a hedging counterparty to request the posting of collateral that it is contractually owed under the terms of a hedging instrument). With respect to the termination of an existing Swap, the amount due would generally be equal to the unrealized loss of the open Swap position with the hedging counterparty and could also include other fees and charges. These economic losses will be reflected in our financial results of operations and our ability to fund these obligations will depend on the liquidity of our assets and access to capital at the time. Any losses we incur on our hedging instruments could materially adversely affect our earnings and thus our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. The characteristics of hedging instruments present various concerns, including illiquidity, enforceability, and counterparty risks, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. As indicated above, from time to time we enter into Swaps. Entities entering into Swaps are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these transactions. Rules issued by the CFTC that became effective in October 2012 require the clearing of all Swap transactions through registered derivatives clearing organizations, or swap execution facilities, through standardized documents under which each Swap counterparty transfers its position to another entity whereby the centralized clearinghouse effectively becomes the counterparty to each side of the Swap. It is the intent of the Dodd-Frank Act that the clearing of Swaps in this manner is designed to avoid concentration of swap risk in any single entity by spreading and centralizing the risk in the clearinghouse and its members. In addition to greater initial and periodic margin (collateral) requirements and additional transaction fees both by the swap execution facility and the clearinghouse, the Swap transactions are now subjected to greater regulation by both the CFTC and the SEC. These additional fees, costs, margin requirements, documentation requirements, and regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Clearing facilities or exchanges upon which our hedging instruments are traded may increase margin requirements on our hedging instruments in the event of adverse economic developments. In response to events having or expected to have adverse economic consequences or which create market uncertainty, clearing facilities or exchanges upon which some of our hedging instruments (i.e., interest rate swaps) are traded may require us to post additional collateral against our hedging instruments. For example, in response to the U.S. approaching its debt ceiling without resolution and the federal government shutdown, in October 2013, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced that it would increase margin requirements by 12% for all over-the-counter interest rate swap portfolios that its clearinghouse guaranteed. This increase was subsequently rolled back shortly thereafter upon the news that Congress passed legislation to temporarily suspend the national debt ceiling and reopen the federal government, and provide a time period for broader negotiations concerning federal budgetary issues. In the event that future adverse economic developments or market uncertainty (including those due to governmental, regulatory, or legislative action or inaction) result in increased margin requirements for our hedging instruments, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity position, business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Taxation as a REIT and the Taxation of Our Assets If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability, which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders. We have elected to qualify as a REIT and intend to comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or the Code), related to REIT qualification. Accordingly, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent we distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income (which is generally our taxable income, computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction, any net income from prohibited transactions, and any net income from foreclosure property) to stockholders within the timeframe permitted under the Code and provided that we comply with certain income, asset ownership and other tests applicable to REITs. We believe that we currently meet all of the REIT requirements and intend to continue to qualify as a REIT under the provisions of the Code. Many of the REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. The determination of whether we are a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances, some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve interpretation. For example, if we are to qualify as a REIT, annually at least 75% of our gross income must come from, among other sources, interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property or interests in real property, gain from the disposition of real property, including mortgages or interests in real property (other than sales or dispositions of real property, including mortgages on real property, or securities 28 Table of Contents that are treated as mortgages on real property, that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business (i.e., prohibited transactions)), dividends or other distributions on, and gains from the disposition of shares in other REITs, commitment fees received for agreements to make real estate loans and certain temporary investment income. In addition, the composition of our assets must meet certain requirements at the close of each quarter. We are also required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding net capital gain). There can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy these or other requirements or that the Internal Revenue Service (or IRS) or a court would agree with any conclusions or positions we have taken in interpreting the REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT qualification unless we meet certain statutory relief provisions. If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year for any reason, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income. Any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT. Our failure to maintain our qualification as a REIT would cause our stock to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange (or NYSE). The NYSE requires, as a condition to the listing of our shares, that we maintain our REIT status. Consequently, if we fail to maintain our REIT status, our shares would promptly be delisted from the NYSE, which would decrease the trading activity of such shares. This could make it difficult to sell shares and would likely cause the market volume of the shares trading to decline. If we were delisted as a result of losing our REIT status and desired to relist our shares on the NYSE, we would have to reapply to the NYSE to be listed as a domestic corporation. As the NYSE listing standards for REITs are less onerous than its standards for domestic corporations, it would be more difficult for us to become a listed company under these heightened standards. We might not be able to satisfy the NYSE listing standards for a domestic corporation. As a result, if we were delisted from the NYSE, we might not be able to relist as a domestic corporation, in which case our shares could not trade on the NYSE. REIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain) to our stockholders within the timeframe permitted under the Code. We generally must make these distributions in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely (including extensions) file our tax return for the year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates. In addition, if we should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of (a) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for such year, (b) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year, and (c) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we would be subject to a non-deductible 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the sum of (x) the amounts actually distributed, plus (y) the amounts of income we retained and on which we have paid corporate income tax. The dividend distribution requirement limits the amount of cash we have available for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. Additionally, our taxable income may substantially exceed our net income as determined by GAAP. As an example, realized capital losses may be included in our GAAP net income, but may not be deductible in computing our taxable income. In addition, we may invest in assets that generate taxable income in excess of economic income or in advance of the corresponding cash flow from the assets. Also, our ability, or the ability of our subsidiaries, to deduct interest may be limited under Section 163(j) of the Code. To the extent that we generate such non-cash taxable income or have limitations on our deductions in a taxable year, we may have to borrow funds on unfavorable terms, sell investments at disadvantageous prices, distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions or make a taxable distribution of our stock to make distributions sufficient to maintain our qualification as a REIT or avoid corporate income tax in a particular year. These alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our stockholders equity. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. 29 Table of Contents Even if we remain qualified as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. Even if we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be required to pay certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure, excise taxes, state or local income, property and transfer taxes, such as mortgage recording taxes, and other taxes. In addition, in order to meet the REIT qualification requirements, to prevent the recognition of certain types of non-cash income, or to avert the imposition of a 100% tax that applies to certain gains derived by a REIT from dealer property or inventory (i.e., prohibited transactions tax) we may hold some of our assets through TRSs or other subsidiary corporations that will be subject to corporate level income tax at regular rates. In addition, if we lend money to a TRS, the TRS may be unable to deduct all or a portion of the interest paid to us, which could result in an even higher corporate level tax liability. Furthermore, the Code imposes a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and a REIT that are not conducted at an arm s-length basis. We intend to structure any transaction with a TRS on terms that we believe are arm s-length to avoid incurring this 100% excise tax. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to avoid application of the 100% excise tax. Any of these taxes would reduce our operating cash flow and thus our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. If our foreign TRS is subject to U.S. federal income tax at the entity level, it would greatly reduce the amounts those entities would have available to pay its creditors and distribute to us. There is a specific exemption from regular U.S. federal income tax for non-U.S. corporations that restrict their activities in the United States to trading stock and securities (or any activity closely related thereto) for their own account, whether such trading (or such other activity) is conducted by the corporation or its employees through a resident broker, commission agent, custodian or other agent. We intend that our foreign TRS will rely on that exemption or otherwise operate in a manner so that it will not be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax on its net income at the entity level. If the IRS succeeded in challenging that tax treatment, it would greatly reduce the amount that the foreign TRS would have available to pay to its creditors and to distribute to us. In addition, even if our foreign TRS qualifies for that exemption, it may nevertheless be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax on certain types of income. Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities. To remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts that we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. We may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution, and may be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the source-of-income or asset-diversification requirements for qualifying as a REIT. In addition, in certain cases, the modification of a debt instrument could result in the conversion of the instrument from a qualifying real estate asset to a wholly or partially non-qualifying asset that must be contributed to a TRS or disposed of in order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to make and, in certain cases, to maintain ownership of, certain attractive investments. Our use of TRSs may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. The net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed to us, and such undistributed TRS income is generally not subject to our REIT distribution requirements. However, if the accumulation of cash or reinvestment of significant earnings in our TRSs causes the fair market value of our securities in those entities, taken together with other non-qualifying assets, to exceed 25% of the fair market value of our assets, in each case as determined for REIT asset testing purposes, we would, absent timely responsive action, fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Additionally, if the accumulation of cash or reinvestment of significant earnings in our TRSs causes the fair market value of our securities in those entities to exceed 20% of the fair market value of our assets, in each case as determined for REIT asset testing purposes, we would, absent timely responsive action, similarly fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT. We may generate taxable income that differs from our GAAP income on our Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loan investments purchased at a discount to par value, which may result in significant timing variances in the recognition of income and losses. We have acquired and intend to continue to acquire Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loans at prices that reflect significant market discounts on their unpaid principal balances. For financial statement reporting purposes, we generally establish a portion of the purchase discount on Non-Agency MBS as a Credit Reserve. This Credit Reserve is generally not accreted into income for financial statement reporting purposes. For tax purposes, however, we are not permitted to anticipate, 30 Table of Contents or establish a reserve for, credit losses prior to their occurrence. As a result, discount on securities acquired in the primary or secondary market is included in the determination of taxable income and is not impacted by losses until such losses are incurred. Such differences in accounting for tax and GAAP can lead to significant timing variances in the recognition of income and losses. Taxable income on Non-Agency MBS purchased at a discount to their par value may be higher than GAAP earnings in early periods (before losses are actually incurred) and lower than GAAP earnings in periods during and subsequent to when realized credit losses are incurred. Dividends will be declared and paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on REIT taxable earnings, our financial results and overall financial condition, maintenance of our REIT qualification and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time. The tax on prohibited transactions may limit our ability to engage in transactions, including certain methods of securitizing mortgage loans, that would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A REIT net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, but including mortgage loans, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. We might be subject to this tax if we were to dispose of or securitize loans or MBS securities in a manner that was treated as a sale of the loans or MBS for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, to avoid the prohibited transactions tax, we may choose to engage in certain sales of loans through a TRS and not at the REIT level, and we may be limited as to the structures we are able to utilize for our securitization transactions, even though the sales or structures might otherwise be beneficial to us. We do not believe that our securitizations to date have been subject to this tax, but there can be no assurances that the IRS would agree with such treatment. If the IRS successfully challenged such treatment, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The taxable mortgage pool rules may increase the taxes that we or our stockholders may incur and may limit the manner in which we effect future securitizations. Securitizations by us or our subsidiaries could result in the creation of taxable mortgage pools for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The real estate mortgage investment conduit (or REMIC) provisions of the Code generally provide that REMICs are the only form of pass-through entity permitted to issue debt obligations with two or more maturities if the payments on those obligations bear a relationship to the mortgage obligations held by such entity. If we engage in a non-REMIC securitization transaction, directly or indirectly through a QRS, in which the assets held by the securitization vehicle consist largely of mortgage loans or MBS, in which the securitization vehicle issues to investors two or more classes of debt instruments that have different maturities, and in which the timing and amount of payments on the debt instruments is determined in large part by the amounts received on the mortgage loans or MBS held by the securitization vehicle, the securitization vehicle will be a taxable mortgage pool. As long as we or another REIT holds a 100% interest in the equity interests in a taxable mortgage pool, either directly or through a QRS, the taxable mortgage pool will not be subject to tax. A portion of the income that we realize with respect to the equity interest we hold in a taxable mortgage pool will, however, be considered to be excess inclusion income and, as a result, a portion of the dividends that we pay to our stockholders will be considered to consist of excess inclusion income. Such excess inclusion income is treated as unrelated business taxable income (or UBTI) for tax-exempt stockholders, is subject to withholding for foreign stockholders (without the benefit of any treaty reduction), and is not subject to reduction by net operating loss carryovers. In addition to the extent that our stock is owned by tax-exempt disqualified organizations, such as certain government-related entities and charitable remainder trusts that are not subject to tax on unrelated business income, we may incur a corporate level tax on a portion of our income from the taxable mortgage pool. In that case, we may reduce the amount of our distributions to any disqualified organization whose stock ownership gave rise to the tax. Historically, we have not generated excess inclusion income; however, despite our efforts, we may not be able to avoid creating or distributing excess inclusion income to our stockholders in the future. In addition, we could face limitations in selling equity interests to outside investors in securitization transactions that are taxable mortgage pools or selling any debt securities issued in connection with these securitizations that might be considered to be equity interests for tax purposes. These limitations may prevent us from using certain techniques to maximize our returns from securitization transactions. We have not established a minimum dividend payment level, and there is no guarantee that we will maintain current dividend payment levels or pay dividends in the future. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must comply with a number of requirements under U.S. federal tax law, including that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income within the timeframe permitted under the Code, which is calculated generally before the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain. Dividends will be declared and paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our REIT taxable earnings, our financial results and overall condition, maintenance of our REIT qualification and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time. We have not established a minimum dividend payment level for our common stock and our ability to pay dividends may be 31 Table of Contents negatively impacted by adverse changes in our operating results. Therefore, our dividend payment level may fluctuate significantly, and, under some circumstances, we may not pay dividends at all. Our reported GAAP net income may differ from the amount of REIT taxable income and dividend distribution requirements and, therefore, our GAAP results may not be an accurate indicator of future taxable income and dividend distributions. Generally, the cumulative net income we report over the life of an asset will be the same for GAAP and tax purposes, although the timing of this income recognition over the life of the asset could be materially different. Differences exist in the accounting for GAAP net income and REIT taxable income which can lead to significant variances in the amount and timing of when income and losses are recognized under these two measures. Due to these differences, our reported GAAP financial results could materially differ from our determination of REIT taxable income and our dividend distribution requirements, and, therefore, our GAAP results may not be an accurate indicator of future taxable income and dividend distributions. Over time, accounting principles, conventions, rules, and interpretations may change, which could affect our reported GAAP and taxable earnings, and stockholders equity. Accounting rules for the various aspects of our business change from time to time. Changes in GAAP, or the accepted interpretation of these accounting principles, can affect our reported income, earnings, and stockholders equity. In addition, changes in tax accounting rules or the interpretations thereof could affect our REIT taxable income and our dividend distribution requirements. These changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations. The failure of assets subject to repurchase agreements to qualify as real estate assets could adversely affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT. We enter into certain financing arrangements that are structured as sale and repurchase agreements pursuant to which we nominally sell certain of our assets to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase these assets at a later date in exchange for a purchase price. Economically, these agreements are financings that are secured by the assets sold pursuant thereto. We generally believe that we would be treated for REIT asset and income test purposes as the owner of the assets that are the subject of any such sale and repurchase agreement notwithstanding that such agreement may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert that we did not own the assets during the term of the sale and repurchase agreement, in which case we could fail to remain qualified as a REIT. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. The REIT provisions of the Code could substantially limit our ability to hedge our business. Any income from a properly designated hedging transaction we enter into to manage the risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made, or ordinary obligations incurred or to be incurred, to acquire or carry real estate assets, or from certain other limited types of hedging transactions, generally does not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may have to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because a TRS would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in a TRS will generally not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income in the TRS. We may be required to report taxable income for certain investments in excess of the economic income we ultimately realize from them. We may acquire debt instruments in the secondary market for less than their face amount. The discount at which such debt instruments are acquired may reflect doubts about their ultimate collectability rather than current market interest rates. The amount of such discount will nevertheless generally be treated as market discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which we are required to include in our taxable income either over time or as principal payments are received, as applicable. If we collect less on the debt instrument than our purchase price plus the market discount we had previously reported as income, we may not be able to benefit from any offsetting loss deductions. Some of the debt instruments that we acquire may have been issued with original issue discount. We will be required to report such original issue discount based on a constant yield method and will be taxed based on the assumption that all future 32 Table of Contents projected payments due on such debt instruments will be made. If such debt instruments turn out not to be fully collectible, an offsetting loss deduction will become available only in the later year that uncollectability is provable. In addition, we may acquire debt instruments that are subsequently modified by agreement with the borrower. If the amendments to the outstanding instrument are significant modifications under the applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, the modified instrument will be considered to have been reissued to us in a debt-for-debt exchange with the borrower. In that event, we may be required to recognize taxable gain to the extent the principal amount of the modified instrument exceeds our adjusted tax basis in the unmodified instrument, even if the value of the instrument or the payment expectations have not changed. Following such a taxable modification, we would hold the modified loan with a cost basis equal to its principal amount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Finally, in the event that any debt instruments acquired by us are delinquent as to mandatory principal and interest payments, or in the event payments with respect to a particular instrument are not made when due, we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income as it accrues, despite doubt as to its ultimate collectability. Similarly, we may be required to accrue interest income with respect to debt instruments at its stated rate regardless of whether corresponding cash payments are received or are ultimately collectible. In each case, while we would in general ultimately have an offsetting loss deduction available to us when such interest was determined to be uncollectible, the utility of that deduction could depend on our having taxable income in that later year or thereafter. For these and other reasons, we may have difficulty making distributions sufficient to maintain our qualification as a REIT or avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. The interest apportionment rules may affect our ability to comply with the REIT asset and gross income tests. Most of the Purchased Credit Deteriorated and Non-performing loans that we have acquired were acquired by us at a discount from their outstanding principal amount, because our pricing was generally based on the value of the underlying real estate that secures those mortgage loans. Treasury Regulation Section 1.856-5(c) (the interest apportionment regulation ) provides that if a mortgage is secured by both real property and other property, a REIT is required to apportion its annual interest income to the real property security based on a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the real property securing the loan, determined when the REIT commits to acquire the loan, and the denominator of which is the highest principal amount of the loan during the year. If a mortgage is secured by both real property and personal property and the value of the personal property does not exceed 15% of the aggregate value of the property securing the mortgage, the mortgage is treated as secured solely by real property for this purpose. Revenue Procedure 2014-51 interprets the principal amount of the loan to be the face amount of the loan, despite the Code requiring taxpayers to treat any market discount, that is the difference between the purchase price of the loan and its face amount, for all purposes (other than certain withholding and information reporting purposes) as interest rather than principal. The interest apportionment regulation applies only if the debt in question is secured both by real property and personal property. We believe that all of the mortgage loans that we acquire at a discount under the circumstances contemplated by Revenue Procedure 2014-51 are secured only by real property, and no other property value is taken into account in our underwriting and pricing. Accordingly, we believe that the interest apportionment regulation does not apply to our portfolio. Nevertheless, if the IRS were to assert successfully that our mortgage loans were secured by property other than real estate, that the interest apportionment regulation applied for purposes of our REIT testing, and that the position taken in Revenue Procedure 2014-51 should be applied to our portfolio, then depending upon the value of the real property securing our loans and their face amount, and the sources of our gross income generally, we might not be able to meet the REIT 75% gross income test, and possibly the asset tests applicable to REITs. If we did not meet these tests, we could potentially either lose our REIT status or be required to pay a tax penalty to the IRS. With respect to the REIT 75% asset test, Revenue Procedure 2014-51 provides a safe harbor under which the IRS will not challenge a REIT treatment of a loan as being a real estate asset in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the greater of (a) the current value of the real property securing the loan or (b) the fair market value of the real property securing the loan determined as of the date the REIT committed to acquire the loan or (2) the fair market value of the loan on the date of the relevant quarterly REIT asset testing date. This safe harbor, if it applied to us, would help us comply with the REIT asset tests following the acquisition of distressed debt if the value of the real property securing the loan were to subsequently decline. If we did not meet one or more of the REIT asset tests, then we could potentially either lose our REIT status or be required to pay a tax penalty to the IRS. 33 Table of Contents Dividends paid by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for qualified dividend income. Qualified dividend income payable to U.S. investors that are individuals, trusts, and estates is subject to the reduced maximum tax rate applicable to long-term capital gains. Dividends paid by REITs, however, are generally not eligible for the reduced qualified dividend rates. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026, non-corporate taxpayers may deduct up to 20% of certain pass-through business income, including qualified REIT dividends (generally, dividends received by a REIT stockholder that are not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income), subject to certain limitations. Although the reduced U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income does not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends payable by REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends and the reduced corporate tax rate could cause certain non-corporate investors to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including our common stock. We may in the future choose to make distributions in our own stock, in which case you could be required to pay income taxes in excess of any cash distributions you receive. We may in the future make taxable distributions that are payable in cash and shares of our common stock at the election of each stockholder. Taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include the full amount of the distribution as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes. As a result, stockholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such distributions in excess of the cash distributions received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock that it receives as a distribution in order to pay this tax, the sale proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the distribution, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such distributions, including in respect of all or a portion of such distribution that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on distributions, it may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. The IRS has issued guidance authorizing elective cash/stock dividends to be made by public REITs where there is a minimum amount of cash that must be paid as part of the dividend, provided that certain requirements are met. It is unclear whether and to what extent we would be able to or choose to pay taxable distributions in cash and stock. In addition, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not impose additional requirements in the future with respect to taxable cash/stock distributions, including on a retroactive basis, or assert that the requirements for such taxable cash/stock distributions have not been met. New legislation or administrative or judicial action, in each instance potentially with retroactive effect, could make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a REIT. The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of REITs and their shareholders may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, which could affect the U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in us. Revisions in U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof, including those dealing with REITs, are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations. Such changes could affect or cause us to change our investments and commitments and affect the tax considerations of an investment in us. In addition, several proposals have been made that would make substantial changes to the federal income tax laws generally. We cannot predict whether any of these proposed changes will become law. We cannot predict the long-term effect of any future law changes on REITs and their stockholders. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets. Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure Our ownership limitations may restrict business combination opportunities. To qualify as a REIT under the Code, no more than 50% of the value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or under applicable attribution rules, by five or fewer individuals (as defined by the Code to include certain entities) during the last half of each taxable year. To preserve our REIT qualification, among other things, our charter generally prohibits direct or indirect ownership by any person of more than 9.8% of the number or value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock. Generally, shares owned by affiliated owners will be aggregated for purposes of the ownership limit. Any transfer of shares of our capital stock or other event that, if effective, would (a) violate the ownership limit, (b) cause us to become closely held under Section 856(h) of the Code or (c) would cause our equity stock to be owned by fewer than 100 34 Table of Contents persons, will be void as to that number of shares of capital stock in excess of the ownership limit, causing us to be closely held or which would otherwise be owned by the transferee, respectively, and the intended transferee will acquire no rights in such shares. Shares issued or transferred that would cause any stockholder to own more than the ownership limit or cause us to become closely held under Section 856(h) of the Code will automatically be converted into an equal number of shares of excess stock. All excess stock will be automatically transferred, without action by the prohibited owner, to a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more charitable beneficiaries that we select, and the prohibited owner will not acquire any rights in the shares of excess stock. The restrictions on ownership and transfer contained in our charter could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction in which holders of shares of common stock might receive a premium for their shares of common stock over the then current market price or that such holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests. The ownership limit provisions also may make our shares of common stock an unsuitable investment vehicle for any person seeking to obtain, either alone or with others as a group, ownership of more than 9.8% of the number or value of our outstanding shares of capital stock. Provisions of Maryland law and other provisions of our organizational documents may limit the ability of a third-party to acquire us. Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (or MGCL) may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interests, including: business combination provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested stockholder (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of our then outstanding stock) or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter impose two supermajority stockholder voting requirements to approve these combinations (unless our common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares); and control share provisions that provide that holders of control shares of our company (defined as voting shares of stock which, when aggregated with all other shares controlled by the acquiring stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a control share acquisition (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of control shares ) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares. Our bylaws provide that we are not subject to the control share provisions of the MGCL. However, our Board may elect to make the control share statute applicable to us at any time, and may do so without stockholder approval. Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL permits our Board, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to elect on behalf of our company to be subject to statutory provisions that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interest. Our Board may elect to opt in to any or all of the provisions of Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL without stockholder approval at any time. In addition, without our having elected to be subject to Subtitle 8, our charter and bylaws already (1) provide for a classified board, (2) require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors for the removal of any director from our Board, which removal will be allowed only for cause and (3) vest in our Board the exclusive power to fix the number of directorships. These provisions may delay or prevent a change of control of our company. Future offerings of debt securities, which would rank senior to our common stock upon liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities, which would dilute our existing stockholders and may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt or additional offerings of equity securities, including commercial paper, senior or subordinated notes and series or classes of preferred stock or common stock. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock, if any, and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. 35 Table of Contents Preferred stock could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments or both that could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to the holders of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their stock holdings in us. Our Board may approve the issuance of capital stock with terms that may discourage a third-party from acquiring us. Our charter permits our Board to issue shares of preferred stock, issuable in one or more classes or series. We may issue a class of preferred stock to individual investors in order to comply with the various REIT requirements or to finance our operations. Our charter further permits our Board to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of preferred or common stock and establish the preferences and rights (including, among others, voting, dividend and conversion rights) of any such shares of stock, which rights may be superior to those of shares of our common stock. Thus, our Board could authorize the issuance of shares of preferred or common stock with terms and conditions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of the outstanding shares of our common stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price of our common stock. Future issuances or sales of shares could cause our share price to decline. Sales of substantial numbers of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through a sale of additional equity securities. Other issuances of our common stock, such as through equity awards to our employees, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, future issuances of our common stock may be dilutive to existing stockholders. The declaration, amount and payment of future cash dividends on shares of our common stock are subject to uncertainty due to disruption in the mortgage, housing or related sectors, such as market conditions related to COVID-19. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board. From time to time, our Board may adjust our quarterly cash dividend on our shares of our common stock from prior quarters. The payment of dividends may be more uncertain during severe market disruption in the mortgage, housing or related sectors, such as those experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Other Business Risks We are dependent on our executive officers and other key personnel for our success, the loss of any of whom may materially adversely affect our business. Our success is dependent upon the efforts, experience, diligence, skill and network of business contacts of our executive officers and other key personnel. The departure of any of our executive officers and/or key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and performance. We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to acquire desirable investments, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire residential mortgage assets or other investments at favorable prices. In acquiring our investments, we compete with a variety of institutional investors, including other REITs, public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance and insurance companies and other financial institutions. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. Many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT compliance or maintenance of an exemption from the Investment Company Act similar to ours. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, establish business relationships that we would not be willing to enter into, or compete aggressively against us to acquire residential mortgage assets from our existing asset sellers or financing counterparties. Furthermore, government or regulatory action and competition for investment securities of the types and classes which we acquire may lead to the price of such assets increasing, which may further limit our ability to generate desired returns. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial 36 Table of Contents condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, desirable investments may be limited in the future and we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, as we can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objectives. 37 Table of Contents Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. Office Leases Our primary lease commitments relate to our corporate headquarters. In April 2021, we relocated our corporate headquarters, terminating our prior lease on April 30, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded an expense of approximately $4.0 million in connection with these two leases. In addition, we have a lease through February 2025 for our Lima One offices located in Greenville, South Carolina. At December 31, 2021, we expect our future rent expense, exclusive of possible rent escalation charges and normal recurring charges for maintenance, insurance and taxes, to be approximately $5.0 million per year. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. There are no material legal proceedings to which we are a party or to which any of our assets are subject. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. 38 Table of Contents PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Market Information Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol MFA . Our Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock are also listed on the NYSE, under the symbols MFA/PB and MFA/PC , respectively. Holders As of February 18, 2022, we had 495 registered holders of our common stock. Such information was obtained through our registrar and transfer agent, based on the results of a broker search. Dividends No dividends may be paid on our common stock unless full cumulative dividends have been paid on our preferred stock. We have paid full cumulative dividends on our preferred stock on a quarterly basis through December 31, 2021. We have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock on a quarterly basis. During 2021 and 2020, we declared total cash dividends to holders of our common stock of $169.3 million ($0.385 per share) and $56.5 million ($0.125 per share), respectively. In general, our common stock dividends have been characterized as ordinary income to our stockholders for income tax purposes. However, a portion of our common stock dividends may, from time to time, be characterized as capital gains or return of capital. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the portion of our common stock dividends that was deemed to be a return of capital was $0.2628 per share of common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the portion of our common stock dividends that was deemed to be a return of capital was $0.05 per share of common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the portion of our common stock dividends that were deemed to be capital gains were $0.1672 per share of common stock. (For additional dividend information, see Notes 10(a) and 10(b) to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1998 and, as such, anticipate distributing at least 90% of our REIT taxable income within the timeframe permitted by the Code. Although we may borrow funds to make distributions, cash for such distributions has generally been, and is expected to continue to be, largely generated from our results of our operations. The table below provides details of dividends on our common stock declared during the years 2021 and 2020: Year Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date Dividend Per Share 2021 December 14, 2021 December 31, 2021 January 31, 2022 $0.110 (1) September 15, 2021 September 30, 2021 October 29, 2021 0.100 June 15, 2021 June 30, 2021 July 30, 2021 0.100 March 12, 2021 March 31, 2021 April 30, 2021 0.075 2020 December 17, 2020 December 30, 2020 January 29, 2021 $0.075 (2) August 6, 2020 September 30, 2020 October 30, 2020 0.050 (1) At December 31, 2021, we had accrued dividends and dividend equivalents payable of $47.8 million related to the common stock dividend declared on December 14, 2021. This dividend will be considered taxable income to the recipient in 2022. For more information see our 2021 Dividend Tax Information on our website. (2) At December 31, 2020, we had accrued dividends and dividend equivalents payable of $34.0 million related to the common stock dividend declared on December 17, 2020. This dividend was considered taxable income to the recipient in 2021. For more information see our 2020 Dividend Tax Information on our website. We have not established a minimum payout level for our common stock. Dividends are declared and paid at the discretion of our Board and depend on our cash available for distribution, financial condition, ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT, and such other factors that our Board may deem relevant. (See Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors and Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on 39 Table of Contents Form 10-K, for information regarding the sources of funds used for dividends and for a discussion of factors, if any, which may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends.) Purchases of Equity Securities On November 2, 2020, our Board authorized a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $250 million of our common stock through the end of 2022. The Board authorization replaces the authorization under our existing stock repurchase program that was adopted in December 2013, which authorized us to repurchase up to 10 million shares of common stock and under which approximately 6.6 million shares remained available for repurchase. The stock repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares. The timing and extent to which we repurchase our shares will depend upon, among other things, market conditions, share price, liquidity, regulatory requirements and other factors, and repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the stock repurchase program may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means, in accordance with applicable securities laws (including, in our discretion, through the use of one or more plans adopted under Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (or the Exchange Act )). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased 20,101,494 shares of our common stock through the stock repurchase program at an average cost of $4.26 per share and a total cost of approximately $85.6 million, net of fees and commissions paid to the sales agent of approximately $201,000. As of December 31, 2021, we were permitted to purchase an additional $80.3 million of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. In addition, we have repurchased 7,870,658 shares of our common stock through the stock repurchase program in the first quarter of 2022 through February 18, 2022, through the use of a plan adopted under Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The following table presents information with respect to (i) shares of common stock repurchased by us under the stock repurchase program and (ii) restricted shares withheld (under the terms of grants under our Equity Compensation Plan (or Equity Plan)) to offset tax withholding obligations that occur upon the vesting and release of restricted stock awards and/or restricted stock units (or RSUs) and (iii) approximate dollar value for repurchase under the stock repurchase program during the fourth quarter of 2021: Month Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) Weighted Average Price Paid Per Share (2) Total Number of Shares Repurchased as Part of Publicly Announced Repurchase Program or Employee Plan Approximate Dollar Value that May Yet be Purchased Under the Repurchase Program or Employee Plan October 1-31, 2021: Shares Repurchased (3) $ $ 117,696,744 November 1-30, 2021: Shares Repurchased (3) 5,416,070 $ 4.42 5,416,070 $ 93,838,258 December 1-31, 2021: Shares Repurchased (3) 3,079,195 4.42 3,079,195 $ 80,264,989 Total Shares Repurchased (3) 8,495,265 $ 4.42 8,495,265 $ 80,264,989 Employee Transactions (4) $ N/A N/A (1) The Board authorized our stock repurchase program on November 2, 2020, under which we may repurchase up to $250 million of our common stock through the end of 2022.

(4) Our Equity Plan provides that the value of the shares delivered or withheld be based on the price of our common stock on the date the relevant transaction occurs. 40 Table of Contents Discount Waiver, Direct Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan In September 2003, we initiated a Discount Waiver, Direct Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan (or the DRSPP) to provide existing stockholders and new investors with a convenient and economical way to purchase shares of our common stock. Under the DRSPP, existing stockholders may elect to automatically reinvest all or a portion of their cash dividends in additional shares of our common stock and existing stockholders and new investors may make optional cash purchases of shares of our common stock in amounts ranging from $50 (or $1,000 for new investors) to $10,000 on a monthly basis and, with our prior approval, in excess of $10,000. At our discretion, we may issue shares of our common stock under the DRSPP at discounts of up to 5% from the prevailing market price at the time of purchase. Computershare Shareowner Services LLC is the administrator of the DRSPP (or the Plan Agent). Stockholders who own common stock that is registered in their own name and who want to participate in the DRSPP must deliver a completed enrollment form to the Plan Agent. Stockholders who own common stock that is registered in a name other than their own (e.g., broker, bank or other nominee) and who want to participate in the DRSPP must either request such nominee holder to participate on their behalf or request that such nominee holder re-register our common stock in the stockholder name and deliver a completed enrollment form to the Plan Agent. During the years ended 2021 and 2020, we issued 431,699 and 235,635 shares of common stock through the DRSPP generating net proceeds of approximately $1.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively. At-the-Market Offering Program On August 16, 2019, we entered into a three-year distribution agreement under the terms of which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $400.0 million (or the ATM Shares), from time to time, through various sales agents, pursuant to an at-the-market equity offering program (or the ATM Program). Sales of the ATM Shares, if any, may be made in negotiated transactions or by transactions that are deemed to be at-the-market offerings, as defined in Rule 415 under the 1933 Act, including sales made directly on the NYSE or sales made to or through a market maker other than an exchange. The sales agents are entitled to compensation of up to two percent of the gross sales price per share for any shares of common stock sold under the distribution agreement. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not sell any shares of common stock through the ATM Program. At December 31, 2021, approximately $390.0 million remained outstanding for future offerings under this program. Item 6. Reserved. 41 Table of Contents Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. GENERAL We are a specialty finance company that invests in and finances residential mortgage assets. We invest, on a leveraged basis, in residential whole loans, residential mortgage-backed securities, MSR-related assets and other real estate assets. Through certain of our subsidiaries, we also originate and service business purpose loans for real estate investors. Our principal business objective is to deliver shareholder value through the generation of distributable income and through asset performance linked to residential mortgage credit fundamentals. We selectively invest in residential mortgage assets with a focus on credit analysis, projected prepayment rates, interest rate sensitivity and expected return. We are an internally-managed real estate investment trust. At December 31, 2021, we had total assets of approximately $9.1 billion, of which $7.9 billion, or 87%, represented residential whole loans acquired through interests in certain trusts established to acquire the loans or originated by Lima One. Our Purchased Performing Loans, which as of December 31, 2021 comprised approximately 80% of our residential whole loans, include: (i) loans to finance (or refinance) one-to-four family residential properties that are not considered to meet the definition of a Qualified Mortgage in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (or Non-QM loans), (ii) short-term business purpose loans collateralized by residential properties made to non-occupant borrowers who intend to rehabilitate and sell the property for a profit (or Rehabilitation loans or Fix and Flip loans), (iii) loans to finance (or refinance) non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential properties that are rented to one or more tenants (or Single-family rental loans), (iv) loans on investor properties that conform to the standards for purchase by a federally chartered corporation, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) (or Agency eligible investor loans), and (v) previously originated loans secured by residential real estate that is generally owner occupied (or Seasoned performing loans). In addition, at December 31, 2021, we had approximately $256.7 million in investments in Securities, at fair value, which represented approximately 3% of our total assets. At such date, our Securities, at fair value included MSR-related assets and CRT securities. Our MSR-related assets include term notes whose cash flows are considered to be largely dependent on MSR collateral and loan participations to provide financing to mortgage originators that own MSRs. Our remaining investment-related assets, which represent approximately 4% of our total assets at December 31, 2021, were primarily comprised of REO, capital contributions made to loan origination partners, other interest-earning assets, and loan-related receivables. The results of our business operations are affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income and the market value of our assets, which is driven by numerous factors, including the supply and demand for residential mortgage assets in the marketplace, the terms and availability of adequate financing, general economic and real estate conditions (both on a national and local level), the impact of government actions in the real estate and mortgage sector, and the credit performance of our credit sensitive residential mortgage assets. Changes in these factors, or uncertainty in the market regarding the potential for changes in these factors, can result in significant changes in the value and/or performance of our investment portfolio. Further, our GAAP results may be impacted by market volatility, resulting in changes in market values of certain financial instruments for which changes in fair value are recorded in net income each period, such as certain residential whole loans and CRT securities. Our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates, the slope of the yield curve (i.e., the differential between long-term and short-term interest rates), borrowing costs (i.e., our interest expense) and prepayment speeds, the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties. Interest rates and CPRs (which is an annualized measure of the amount of unscheduled principal prepayments on an asset as a percentage of the asset balance), vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our financial results are impacted by estimates of credit losses that are required to be recorded when loans that are not accounted for at fair value through net income are acquired or originated, as well as changes in these credit loss estimates that will be required to be made periodically. With respect to our business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: (i) the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase; (ii) the value of certain of our residential mortgage assets and, correspondingly, our stockholders equity to decline; (iii) coupons on our adjustable-rate assets to reset, on a delayed basis, to higher interest rates; (iv) prepayments on our assets to decline, thereby slowing the amortization of purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts, and slowing our ability to redeploy capital to generally higher yielding investments; and (v) the value of our derivative hedging instruments, if any, and, correspondingly, our stockholders equity to increase. Conversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: (i) the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease; (ii) the value 42 Table of Contents of certain of our residential mortgage assets and, correspondingly, our stockholders equity to increase; (iii) coupons on our adjustable-rate assets, on a delayed basis, to lower interest rates; (iv) prepayments on our assets to increase, thereby accelerating the amortization of purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts, and accelerating the redeployment of our capital to generally lower yielding investments; and (v) the value of our derivative hedging instruments, if any, and, correspondingly, our stockholders equity to decrease. In addition, our borrowing costs and credit lines are further affected by the type of collateral we pledge and general conditions in the credit market. Our investments in residential mortgage assets expose us to credit risk, meaning that we are generally subject to credit losses due to the risk of delinquency, default and foreclosure on the underlying real estate collateral. Our investment process for credit sensitive assets focuses primarily on quantifying and pricing credit risk. With respect to investments in Purchased Performing Loans, we believe that sound underwriting standards, including low LTVs at origination, significantly mitigate our risk of loss. Further, we believe the discounted purchase prices paid on Purchased Non-performing and Purchased Credit Deteriorated Loans mitigate our risk of loss in the event that, as we expect on most such investments, we receive less than 100% of the par value of these investments. Premiums arise when we acquire an MBS at a price in excess of the aggregate principal balance of the mortgages securing the MBS (i.e., par value) or when we acquire residential whole loans at a price in excess of their aggregate principal balance Conversely, discounts arise when we acquire an MBS at a price below the aggregate principal balance of the mortgages securing the MBS or when we acquire residential whole loans at a price below their aggregate principal balance. Accretable purchase discounts on these investments are accreted to interest income. Premiums paid to purchase loans, primarily on certain of our Non-QM loans, business purpose loans and Agency eligible investor loans, are amortized against interest income over the life of the investment using the effective yield method, adjusted for actual prepayment activity. An increase in the prepayment rate, as measured by the CPR, will typically accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums, thereby reducing the interest income earned on these assets. CPR levels are impacted by, among other things, conditions in the housing market, new regulations, government and private sector initiatives, interest rates, availability of credit to home borrowers, underwriting standards and the economy in general. In particular, CPR reflects the conditional prepayment rate, which measures voluntary prepayments of a loan, and the conditional default rate (or CDR) measures involuntary prepayments resulting from defaults. CPRs on our residential mortgage securities and whole loans may differ significantly. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the average CPRs on certain of our loan portfolios were: 35.3% for Non-QM loans, 24.2% for Single-family rental loans, 17.4% for Purchased Credit Deteriorated loans, and 16.3% for Purchased Non-Performing loans. It is generally our business strategy to hold our residential mortgage assets as long-term investments. On at least a quarterly basis, excluding investments for which the fair value option has been elected or for which specialized loan accounting is otherwise applied, we assess our ability and intent to continue to hold each asset and, as part of this process, we monitor our investments in securities that are designated as AFS for impairment. A change in our ability and/or intent to continue to hold any of these securities that are in an unrealized loss position, or a deterioration in the underlying characteristics of these securities, could result in our recognizing future impairment charges or a loss upon the sale of any such security. Our residential mortgage investments have longer-term contractual maturities than our non-securitization related financing liabilities. Even though the majority of our investments have interest rates that adjust over time based on short-term changes in corresponding interest rate indices (typically following an initial fixed-rate period for our Hybrids), the interest rates we pay on our borrowings will typically change at a faster pace than the interest rates we earn on our investments. In order to reduce this interest rate risk exposure, we may enter into derivative instruments, which currently include Swaps and short positions in to be announced (or TBA) securities. 43 Table of Contents Recent Market Conditions and Our Strategy At December 31, 2021, our residential mortgage asset portfolio, which includes residential whole loans and REO, and Securities, at fair value, was approximately $8.3 billion compared to $6.0 billion at December 31, 2020. The following table presents the activity for our residential mortgage asset portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2021: (In Millions) December 31, 2020 Runoff (1) Acquisitions (2) Other (3) December 31, 2021 Change Residential whole loans and REO $ 5,575 $ (2,167) $ 4,593 $ 68 $ 8,069 $ 2,494 Securities, at fair value 400 (157) 14 257 (143) Totals $ 5,975 $ (2,324) $ 4,593 $ 82 $ 8,326 $ 2,351 (1) Primarily includes principal repayments and sales of REO. (2) Includes draws on previously originated Rehabilitation loans. (3) Primarily includes changes in fair value and changes in the allowance for credit losses. At December 31, 2021, our total recorded investment in residential whole loans and REO was $8.1 billion, or 96.9% of our residential mortgage asset portfolio. Of this amount, $6.3 billion are Purchased Performing Loans, $525.0 million are Purchased Credit Deteriorated Loans and $1.1 billion are Purchased Non-performing Loans. Loan acquisition activity of $4.6 billion during 2021 included $2.2 billion of Non-QM loans, $1.3 billion of business purpose loans (including draws on Rehabilitation loans), and $1.1 billion of Agency eligible investor loans. During 2021, we recognized approximately $303.5 million of residential whole loan interest income on our consolidated statements of operations, representing an effective yield of 5.26%, with Purchased Performing Loans generating an effective yield of 4.35%, Purchased Credit Deteriorated Loans generating an effective yield of 6.56% and Purchased Non-performing Loans generating an effective yield of 8.39%. In addition, all of our Purchased Non-performing Loans and certain of our Purchased Performing Loans are measured at fair value as a result of the election of the fair value option at acquisition. Included in earnings in other income, net are net gains on these loans of $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had REO with an aggregate carrying value of $156.2 million and $249.7 million, respectively, which is included in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. In response to the financial impact of COVID-19 on borrowers, and in compliance with various federal and state guidelines, starting in the first quarter of 2020, we offered short-term relief to certain borrowers who were contractually current at the time the pandemic started to impact the economy. Under the terms of such plans, for certain borrowers a deferral plan was entered into where missed payments were deferred to the maturity of the related loan, with a corresponding change to the loan next payment due date. In addition, certain borrowers were granted up to a seven-month zero pay forbearance with payments required to resume at the conclusion of the plan. For these borrowers, delinquent payments were permitted to be placed on specified repayment plans. While the majority of the borrowers granted relief have resumed making payments at the conclusion of such deferral and forbearance periods, certain borrowers, particularly in our Non-QM loan portfolio, continue to be impacted financially by COVID-19 and have not yet resumed payments. When these borrowers became more than 90 days delinquent on payments, any interest income receivable related to the associated loans was reversed in accordance with our non-accrual policies. At December 31, 2021, Non-QM loans with an unpaid principal balance of $94.8 million, or 2.8% of the portfolio, were more than 90 days delinquent. For these and other borrowers that have been impacted by COVID-19, we are continuing to evaluate loss mitigation options with respect to these loans, including forbearance, repayment plans, loan modification and foreclosure. In addition, at December 31, 2021, Rehabilitation Loans with an unpaid principal balance of $103.0 million, or 14.1% of the portfolio, were more than 90 days delinquent. Because rehabilitation loans are shorter term and repayment is usually dependent on completion of the rehabilitation project and sale of the property, the strategy to resolve delinquent rehabilitation loans differs from owner occupied loans. Consequently, forbearance and repayment plans are offered less frequently. However, we seek to work with delinquent rehabilitation loan borrowers whose projects are close to completion or are listed for sale in order to provide the borrower the opportunity to sell the property and repay our loan. In circumstances where the borrower is not able to complete the project or we are not able to work with the borrower to our mutual benefit, we pursue foreclosure or other forms of resolution. At December 31, 2021, our Securities, at fair value totaled $256.7 million and included $153.8 million of MSR-related assets and $102.9 million of CRT securities. The net yield on our Securities, at fair value was 22.95% for 2021, compared to 6.16% for 2020. The increase in the net yield on our Securities, at fair value portfolio primarily reflects accretion income of approximately $20.5 million recognized during 2021 due to the redemption of MSR-related assets that had been held at amortized cost basis below par due to impairment charges recorded in the first quarter of 2020, and $8.1 million of accretion recognized during 2021 on the redemption of a Non-Agency MBS security that had been previously purchased at a discount. 44 Table of Contents We adopted the accounting standard addressing the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments (CECL) on January 1, 2020 for loans on which we do not elect the fair value option at the time of acquisition. CECL requires that reserves for credit losses be estimated at the reporting date based on expected cash flows for the life of the loan or financial asset, including anticipated prepayments and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. For 2021, we recorded a reversal of provision for credit losses on residential whole loans held at carrying value of $44.9 million. The reversal for the period primarily reflects run-off of loans held at carrying value and adjustments to certain macroeconomic and loan prepayment speed assumptions used in our credit loss forecasts. The total allowance for credit losses recorded on residential whole loans held at carrying value at December 31, 2021 was $39.4 million. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, CECL reserves for credit losses totaling approximately $205,000 were recorded related to undrawn commitments on loans held at carrying value. During 2021, we continued to execute on our strategy of entering into more durable forms of financing by completing eight securitizations consisting of $2.6 billion of residential whole loans. Our GAAP book value per common share was $4.78 as of December 31, 2021. Book value per common share increased from $4.54 as of December 31, 2020. Economic book value per common share, a non-GAAP financial measure of our financial position that adjusts GAAP book value by the amount of unrealized mark-to-market gains on our residential whole loans and securitized debt held at carrying value, was $5.15 as of December 31, 2021, an increase from $4.91 as of December 31, 2020. Increases in GAAP and Economic book value during 2021 reflect GAAP earnings in excess of dividends declared and fair value increases for our Residential whole loans at carrying value. For additional information regarding the calculation of Economic book value per share, including a reconciliation to GAAP book value per share, refer to page 58 under the heading Economic Book Value. Completion of Lima One Acquisition: On July 1, 2021, we completed the previously announced acquisition from affiliates of Magnetar Capital of their ownership interests in Lima One. In connection with this transaction, we also acquired from certain members of Lima One management their ownership interests in the company. We now own 100% of Lima One, and the financial results of Lima One are included in our consolidated financial results from the date of the transaction closing.

Tax Considerations Current period estimated taxable income We estimate that for 2021, our REIT taxable income was approximately $72.2 million. We have until the filing of our 2021 tax return (due not later than October 17, 2022) to declare the distribution of any 2021 REIT taxable income not previously distributed. Key differences between GAAP net income and REIT Taxable Income Residential Whole Loans and Securities The determination of taxable income attributable to residential whole loans and securities is dependent on a number of factors, including principal payments, defaults, loss mitigation efforts and loss severities. In estimating taxable income for such investments during the year, management considers estimates of the amount of discount expected to be accreted. Such estimates require significant judgment and actual results may differ from these estimates. Potential timing differences can arise with respect to the accretion of discount and amortization of premium into income as well as the recognition of gain or loss for tax purposes as compared to GAAP. For example: a) while our REIT uses fair value accounting for GAAP in some instances, it generally is not used for purposes of determining taxable income; b) impairments generally are not recognized by us for income tax purposes until the asset is written-off or sold; c) capital losses may only be recognized by us to the extent of its capital gains; capital losses in excess of capital gains generally are carried over 48 Table of Contents by us for potential offset against future capital gains; and d) tax hedge gains and losses resulting from the termination of interest rate swaps by us generally are amortized over the remaining term of the swap. Securitization Generally, securitization transactions for GAAP and tax can be characterized as either sales or financings, depending on transaction type, structure and available elections. For GAAP purposes, our securitizations have been treated as on-balance sheet financing transactions. For tax purposes, they have been characterized as both financing and sale transactions. Where a securitization has been characterized as a sale, gain or loss is recognized for tax purposes. In addition, we own or may in the future acquire interests in securitization and/or re-securitization trusts, in which several of the classes of securities are or will be issued with original issue discount (or OID). As the holder of the retained interests in the trust, for tax purposes we generally will be required to include OID in our current gross interest income over the term of the applicable securities as the OID accrues. The rate at which the OID is recognized into taxable income is calculated using a constant rate of yield to maturity, with realized losses impacting the amount of OID recognized in REIT taxable income once they are actually incurred. REIT taxable income may be recognized in excess of economic income (i.e., OID) or in advance of the corresponding cash flow from these assets, thereby affecting our dividend distribution requirement to stockholders. For securitization and/or re-securitization transactions that were treated as a sale of the underlying collateral for tax purposes, the unwinding of any such transaction will likely result in taxable income or loss. Given that securitization and re-securitization transactions are typically accounted for as financing transactions for GAAP purposes, such income or loss is not likely to be recognized for GAAP. As a result, the income recognized from securitization and re-securitization transactions may differ for tax and GAAP purposes. Whether our investments are held by our REIT or one of its Taxable REIT Subsidiaries (TRS) We estimate that for 2021, our gross TRS taxable income will be $79.8 million and that we will utilize $72.7 million of net operating loss; resulting in net TRS taxable income of $7.1 million Net income generated by our TRS subsidiaries is included in consolidated GAAP net income, but may not be included in REIT taxable income in the same period. REIT taxable income generally does not include taxable income of the TRS unless and until it is distributed to the REIT. For example, because our securitization transactions that are treated as a sale for tax purposes are undertaken by a domestic TRS, any gain or loss recognized on the sale is not included in our REIT taxable income until it is distributed by the TRS. Similarly, the income earned from loans, securities, REO and other investments held by our domestic TRS is excluded from REIT taxable income until it is distributed by the TRS. Net income of our foreign domiciled TRS subsidiaries is included in REIT taxable income as if distributed to the REIT in the taxable year it is earned by the foreign domiciled TRS. Consequently, our REIT taxable income calculated in a given period may differ significantly from our GAAP net income. 49 Table of Contents Results of Operations In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. For a discussion related to our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, please refer to Part II, Item 7., Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Year Ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the SEC on February 23, 2021, and is available on the SEC website at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.mfafinancial.com. Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020 General For 2021, we had a net income available to our common stock and participating securities of $296.0 million, or $0.67 per basic common share and $0.66 diluted common share, compared to a net loss available to common stock and participating securities for 2020 of $709.2 million, or $1.57 per basic and diluted common share. The prior period results were significantly impacted by the unprecedented disruption in residential mortgage markets due to concerns related to COVID-19 that required management to take actions to bolster and stabilize our balance sheet, improve our liquidity position and renegotiate the financing associated with our remaining investments. The actions included disposing our Agency and Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolios, substantially reducing our investments in MSR-related assets and CRT securities, and sales of certain residential whole loans. In addition, as we had entered into forbearance agreements with the majority of our remaining lenders that were in place for most of the second quarter of 2020, our financing costs were dramatically increased during this period. Asset disposals resulted in net realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaling $188.8 million. Further, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded impairment losses on certain residential mortgage securities and other assets of $425.1 million, recorded losses totaling $57.0 million on terminated Swaps that had previously been designated as hedges for accounting purposes, expenses totaling $25.3 million on the early payment of a senior secured credit agreement and $10.5 million of net unrealized losses on residential mortgage securities measured at fair value through earnings. These losses were partially offset by $20.8 million in net gains on residential whole loans measured at fair value through earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we also recorded a provision for credit losses on residential whole loans and other financial assets of $22.4 million and incurred $44.4 million of professional services and other costs in connection with negotiating and exiting forbearance arrangements with our lenders. Accordingly, the increase in net income available to common stock and participating securities in 2021 over 2020 primarily reflects higher Other income, which in 2021 includes $38.9 million of gains recorded in connection with Lima One purchase accounting and a gain of $34.0 million from the reversal of prior period impairments, while the prior period was characterized by the significant losses discussed above. In addition, Net Interest Income was also significantly higher in 2021, as funding costs significantly decreased in the period after we exited forbearance and due to the increased use of securitization funding. Further, the current period results include a net reversal of provision for credit losses on residential whole loans held at carrying value, compared to a net provision in the prior year and lower operating and other expenses as the prior year period included significant professional services costs associated with restructuring and our forbearance agreements. Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends primarily upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the corresponding interest rates earned or paid. Our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates, the slope of the yield curve (i.e., the differential between long-term and short-term interest rates), borrowing costs (i.e., our interest expense) and prepayment speeds on our investments. Interest rates and CPRs (which measure the amount of unscheduled principal prepayment on a bond or loan as a percentage of its unpaid balance) vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. The changes in average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities and their related yields and costs are discussed in greater detail below under Interest Income and Interest Expense. For 2021, our net interest spread and margin were 2.81% and 3.58%, respectively, compared to a net interest spread and margin of 0.87% and 1.94%, respectively, for 2020. Our net interest income increased by $77.8 million, or 47.4%, to $241.9 million from $164.1 million for 2020. For 2021, net interest income includes higher net interest income from our residential whole loan portfolio of approximately $57.2 million compared to 2020, primarily due to lower financing costs and higher yields, partially offset by lower average balances invested in these assets. In addition, interest expense for 2021 included $6.0 million of interest expense related to 8.00% Senior Notes due 2042 (or Senior Notes) that were redeemed in January of 2021 50 Table of Contents but were outstanding during all of 2020. Net interest income for our Securities, at fair value portfolio increased by approximately $1.9 million compared to 2020, primarily due to a higher yield earned on these assets due to the early redemption at par of several securities during the current year period and lower financing costs, offset by lower average amounts invested in these securities due to portfolio sales in the first and second quarters of 2020. Analysis of Net Interest Income The following table sets forth certain information about the average balances of our assets and liabilities and their related yields and costs for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 . Average yields are derived by dividing interest income by the average amortized cost of the related assets, and average costs are derived by dividing interest expense by the daily average balance of the related liabilities, for the periods shown. The yields and costs include premium amortization and purchase discount accretion which are considered adjustments to interest rates.

For GAAP reporting purposes, purchases and sales are reported on the trade date. Average amortized cost data used to determine yields is calculated based on the settlement date of the associated purchase or sale as interest income is not earned on purchased assets and continues to be earned on sold assets until settlement date. (2) The net yield of 22.95% includes $20.5 million of accretion income recognized in 2021, due to the redemption of MSR-related assets that had been held at amortized cost basis below par due to impairment charges recorded in the first quarter of 2020; and $8.1 million of accretion recognized during 2021 on the redemption of a Non-Agency MBS security that was purchased at a discount. Excluding this accretion, the yield reported would have been 11.38%. (3) Includes average interest-earning cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. (4) Collateralized financing agreements include the following: Secured term notes, Non-mark-to-market term-asset based financing, and repurchase agreements. For additional information, see Note 6, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (5) Average cost of repurchase agreements in the prior year period includes the cost of Swaps allocated based on the proportionate share of the overall estimated weighted average portfolio duration. (6) Includes both Securitized debt, at carrying value and Securitized debt, at fair value. 51 Table of Contents (7) Interest expense for 2020 includes a non-cash charge of $3.1 million recorded in the connection with the redemption of these notes that was completed early in 2021. The yield presented for the period excludes the impact of that charge. (8) Net interest rate spread reflects the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and average cost of funds. (9) Net interest margin reflects net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Rate/Volume Analysis The following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates (yield/cost) and changes in the volume (average balance) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: (i) the changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in average balance multiplied by prior rate); (ii) the changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior average balance); and (iii) the net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately, based on absolute values, to the changes due to rate and volume.

The amortization of these losses increased the funding cost by 116 basis points for Purchased Performing Loans, 107 basis points for Purchased Credit Deteriorated Loans, 77 basis points for Purchased Non-performing Loans, and 108 basis points for total Residential whole loans during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. At June 30, 2020, following the closing of certain financing transactions and our exit from forbearance arrangements, and an evaluation of our anticipated future financing transactions, $49.9 million of unamortized losses on Swaps previously designated as hedges for accounting purposes was transferred from OCI to earnings, as it was determined that certain financing transactions that were previously expected to be hedged by these Swaps were no longer probable of occurring. In addition, cost of funding for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 was significantly higher than for prior periods as it reflects default interest and/or higher rates charged by lenders while we were under a forbearance agreement. During the quarter ended September 30, 2020, we transferred from AOCI to earnings approximately $7.2 million of losses on Swaps that had been previously designated as hedges for accounting purposes as we had assessed that the underlying transactions were no longer probable of occurring.

The following table presents the components of the net interest spread earned on our residential mortgage securities and MSR-related assets for the quarterly periods presented: Securities, at fair value Quarter Ended Net Yield (1)(2) Cost of Funding (3) Net Interest Rate Spread (4) December 31, 2021 26.28 % 1.50 % 24.78 % September 30, 2021 18.78 1.61 17.17 June 30, 2021 24.57 1.81 22.76 March 31, 2021 22.25 2.02 20.23 December 31, 2020 10.15 2.69 7.46 September 30, 2020 9.80 3.49 6.31 June 30, 2020 8.20 5.81 2.39 March 31, 2020 5.22 2.53 2.69 (1) Reflects annualized interest income divided by average amortized cost. Impairment charges recorded on MSR-related assets resulted in a lower amortized cost basis which impacted the calculation of net yields in subsequent periods. (2) For the quarter ended December 31, 2021, the net yield of 26.28% includes $8.1 million of accretion income recognized on the redemption at par of an MSR-related asset that had been held at amortized cost basis below par due to an impairment charge during the first quarter of 2020. Excluding this accretion, the yield reported would have been 11.37%. For the quarter ended September 30, 2021, the net yield of 18.78% includes $4.0 million of accretion income recognized on the redemption at par of an MSR-related asset that had been held at amortized cost basis below par due to an impairment charge during the first quarter of 2020. Excluding this accretion, the yield reported would have been 11.63%. For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the net yield of 24.57% includes $8.4 million of accretion income recognized on the redemption at par of an MSR-related asset that had been held at amortized cost basis below par due to an impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2020. Excluding this accretion, the yield reported would have been 11.13%. For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the net yield of 22.25% includes $8.1 million of accretion income recognized on the redemption of an RPL/NPL MBS security that was previously purchased at a discount. Excluding this accretion, the yield reported would have been 11.26%. (3) Reflects annualized interest expense divided by average balance of repurchase agreements. Securities, at fair value cost of funding includes 26 basis points associated with Swaps to hedge interest rate sensitivity on these assets for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. Cost of funding for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 includes the impact of amortization of $1.7 million of losses previously recorded in OCI related to Swaps unwound during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 that had been previously designated as hedges for accounting purposes. The amortization of these losses increased the funding cost by 109 basis points for total Securities, at fair value during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. At June 30, 2020, following the closing of certain financing transactions and our exit from forbearance arrangements, and an evaluation of our anticipated future financing transactions, $49.9 million of unamortized losses on Swaps previously designated as hedges for accounting purposes was transferred from OCI to earnings, as it was determined that certain financing transactions that were previously expected to be hedged by these Swaps were no longer probable of occurring. In addition, during the quarter ended September 30, 2020, we transferred from AOCI to earnings approximately $7.2 million of losses on Swaps that had been previously designated as hedges for accounting purposes as we had assessed that the underlying transactions were no longer probable of occurring. (4) Reflects the difference between the net yield on average Securities, at fair value, and average cost of funds on Securities, at fair value. 54 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income on our residential whole loans decreased by $28.7 million, or 8.7%, for 2021, to $303.5 million compared to $332.2 million for 2020. This decrease primarily reflects a $627.9 million decrease in the average balance of this portfolio to $5.8 billion for 2021 from $6.4 billion for 2020, partially offset by an increase in the yield to 5.26% for 2021 from 5.19% for 2020. Due to the previously discussed asset sales and impairment charges that primarily occurred late in the first quarter of 2020 to early in the second quarter of 2020, as well as further asset disposals and redemptions that have occurred later in 2020 and throughout 2021, the average amortized cost of our Securities, at fair value portfolio decreased $1.2 billion to $247.0 million for 2021 from $1.5 billion for 2020, and interest income on our Securities, at fair value portfolio decreased $33.4 million to $56.7 million for 2021 from $90.1 million for 2020. The net yield on our Securities, at fair value was 22.95% for 2021, compared to 6.16% for 2020. The increase in the net yield on our Securities, at fair value portfolio primarily reflects approximately $20.5 million of accretion income recognized in 2021 due to the redemption of MSR-related assets that had been held at amortized cost basis below par due to impairment charges recorded in the first quarter of 2020; and $8.1 million of accretion recognized in 2021 due to the redemption of a Non-Agency MBS that had been previously purchased at a discount. Interest Expense Our interest expense for 2021 decreased by $148.4 million, or 55.2%, to $120.4 million, from $268.8 million for 2020. This decrease primarily reflects a decrease in our average collateralized financing agreement borrowings to finance our residential mortgage asset portfolio and a decrease in financing rates on our financing agreements. In addition, in the prior year period we incurred interest expense of approximately $16.2 million related to the senior secured credit agreement we entered into during the second quarter of 2020. Further, 2020 included $11.1 million of interest expense related to our Senior Notes, which were redeemed in the first quarter of 2021. The effective interest rate paid on our borrowings decreased to 2.56% for 2021, from 4.24% for 2020. Provision for Credit Losses on Residential Whole Loans Held at Carrying Value For 2021, we recorded a reversal of provision for credit losses on residential whole loans held at carrying value of $44.9 million (which includes a reversal of provision for credit losses on undrawn commitments of $969,000) compared to a provision of $22.4 million for 2020. The reversal for the period primarily reflects run-off of loans held at carrying value and adjustments to certain macroeconomic and loan prepayment speed assumptions used in our credit loss forecasts. With respect to our residential whole loans held at carrying value, CECL requires that reserves for credit losses are estimated at the reporting date based on expected cash flows over the life of the loan or financial instrument, including anticipated prepayments and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. 55 Table of Contents Other Income, net For 2021, Other Income/(Loss), net increased by $844.7 million, to $165.1 million compared to a $679.6 million loss for 2020. The components of Other Income/(Loss), net for 2021 and 2020 are summarized in the table below: For the Year Ended December 31, (In Thousands) 2021 2020 Net gain on residential whole loans measured at fair value through earnings $ 16,736 $ 20,765 Gain on investment in Lima One common equity (Note 15) 38,933 Impairment and other gains and losses on securities available-for-sale and other assets 33,956 (425,082) Lima One - origination, servicing and other fee income 22,600 Net gain on real estate owned 22,838 5,391 Net realized loss on sales of securities and residential whole loans (188,847) Loss on terminated swaps previously designated as hedges for accounting purposes (57,034) Other residential whole loan related income 4,472 4,268 Net unrealized gain/(loss) on securities, at fair value measured at fair value through earnings 1,605 (10,486) Other 23,963 (28,544) Total Other Income/(Loss), net $ 165,103 $ (679,569) Operating and Other Expense During 2021, we had compensation and benefits and other general and administrative expenses of $85.5 million, compared to $56.7 million for 2020. Compensation and benefits expense increased $22.8 million to $53.8 million for 2021, compared to $31.0 million for 2020 primarily reflecting the impact of including Lima One compensation expense in our financial results and an increase in annual bonus compensation for the current year period. The prior year period also included a provision for estimated severance costs in connection with a reduction in workforce that occurred in the third quarter of 2020. Our other general and administrative expenses increased by $6.1 million to $31.7 million for 2021 compared to $25.7 million for 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of including Lima One expenses in our financial results, increased information technology costs and higher costs associated with deferred compensation to Directors in the current year period, which were impacted by changes in our stock price. In addition, during 2020, we also incurred professional service and other costs of $44.4 million related to negotiating and exiting forbearance arrangements with our lenders. Operating and Other Expense during 2021 also includes $30.9 million of loan servicing and other related operating expenses related to our residential whole loan activities. These expenses decreased compared to 2020 by approximately $9.5 million, or 23.5%, primarily due to lower servicing fees and non-recoverable advances on our REO portfolio and lower expenses recognized related to loan securitization activities. In addition, Other expenses for 2021 also includes $6.6 million of amortization related to intangible assets recognized as part of the purchase accounting for the Lima One acquisition. 56 Table of Contents Selected Financial Ratios The following table presents information regarding certain of our financial ratios at or for the dates presented: At or for the Quarter Ended Return on Average Total Assets (1) Return on Average Total Stockholders Equity (2)(3) Total Average Stockholders Equity to Total Average Assets (4) Dividend Payout Ratio (5) Leverage Multiple (6) Book Value per Share of Common Stock (7) Economic Book Value per Share of Common Stock (8) December 31, 2021 1.67 % 6.84 % 30.00 % 1.38 2.5 $ 4.78 $ 5.15 September 30, 2021 6.64 20.48 34.55 0.36 2.2 4.82 5.25 June 30, 2021 3.46 10.57 37.28 0.77 1.8 4.65 5.10 March 31, 2021 4.55 13.54 37.21 0.44 1.6 4.63 5.08 December 31, 2020 2.12 7.24 35.72 0.94 1.7 4.54 4.91 September 30, 2020 4.17 13.85 33.23 0.29 1.9 4.61 4.92 June 30, 2020 4.33 15.70 30.08 2.0 4.51 4.50 March 31, 2020 (26.72) (26.58) 24.90 3.4 4.34 4.20 (1) Reflects annualized net income available to common stock and participating securities divided by average total assets.

(8) Economic book value is a non-GAAP financial measure of our financial position. To calculate our Economic book value, our portfolios of Residential whole loans and securitized debt held at carrying value are adjusted to their fair value, rather than the carrying value that is required to be reported under the GAAP accounting model applied to these loans. For additional information please refer to page 58 under the heading Economic Book Value . 57 Table of Contents Economic Book Value Economic book value is a non-GAAP financial measure of our financial position. To calculate our Economic book value, our portfolios of Residential whole loans and securitized debt held at carrying value are adjusted to their fair value, rather than the carrying value that is required to be reported under the GAAP accounting model applied to these financial instruments. These adjustments are also reflected in the table below in our end of period stockholders equity. Management considers that Economic book value provides investors with a useful supplemental measure to evaluate our financial position as it reflects the impact of fair value changes for all of our residential mortgage investments and certain associated financing arrangements, irrespective of the accounting model applied for GAAP reporting purposes. Economic book value does not represent and should not be considered as a substitute for Stockholders Equity, as determined in accordance with GAAP, and our calculation of this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The following table provides a reconciliation of our GAAP book value per common share to our non-GAAP Economic book value per common share as of the quarterly periods below: Quarter Ended: (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) December 31, 2021 September 30, 2021 June 30, 2021 March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 September 30, 2020 June 30, 2020 March 31, 2020 GAAP Total Stockholders Equity $ 2,542.8 $ 2,601.1 $ 2,526.5 $ 2,542.3 $ 2,524.8 $ 2,565.7 $ 2,521.1 $ 2,440.7 Preferred Stock, liquidation preference (475.0) (475.0) (475.0) (475.0) (475.0) (475.0) (475.0) (475.0) GAAP Stockholders Equity for book value per common share 2,067.8 2,126.1 2,051.5 2,067.3 2,049.8 2,090.7 2,046.1 1,965.7 Adjustments: Fair value adjustment to Residential whole loans, at carrying value 153.5 198.8 206.2 203.0 173.9 141.1 (25.3) (113.5) Fair value adjustment to Securitized debt, at carrying value (1) 4.3 (8.0) (8.9) (3.6) (5.1) (3.5) 18.0 51.9 Stockholders Equity including fair value adjustments to Residential whole loans and Securitized debt held at carrying value (Economic book value ) (1) $ 2,225.6 $ 2,316.9 $ 2,248.8 $ 2,266.7 $ 2,218.6 $ 2,228.3 $ 2,038.8 $ 1,904.1 GAAP book value per common share $ 4.78 $ 4.82 $ 4.65 $ 4.63 $ 4.54 $ 4.61 $ 4.51 $ 4.34 Economic book value per common share (1) $ 5.15 $ 5.25 $ 5.10 $ 5.08 $ 4.91 $ 4.92 $ 4.50 $ 4.20 Number of shares of common stock outstanding 432.6 440.9 440.8 446.1 451.7 453.3 453.2 453.1 (1) Economic book value per common share for periods prior to December 31, 2021 have been restated to include the impact of fair value changes in securitized debt held at carrying value. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all of our subsidiaries. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Our accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the policies which more significantly rely on estimates and judgments to be as follows: 58 Table of Contents Allowance for Credit Losses on Residential Whole Loans An allowance for credit losses is recorded at acquisition, and maintained on an ongoing basis, for all losses expected over the life of the respective loan. Any required credit loss allowance would reduce the net carrying value of the loan with a corresponding charge to earnings, and may increase or decrease over time. Significant judgments are required in determining any allowance for credit loss, including assumptions regarding the loan cash flows expected to be collected, including related economic forecasts, the value of the underlying collateral and our ability to collect on any other forms of security, such as a personal guaranty provided either by the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower. Fair Value Measurements - Residential Whole Loans GAAP requires the categorization of fair value measurements into three broad levels that form a hierarchy. The following describes the valuation methodologies used for our financial instrument investments categorized as level 3 in the valuation hierarchy, which require the most significant estimates and judgments to be made. We determine the fair value of our residential whole loans after considering valuations obtained from a third-party who specializes in providing valuations of residential mortgage loans. The valuation approach applied generally depends on whether the loan is considered performing or non-performing at the date the valuation is performed. For performing loans, estimates of fair value are derived using a discounted cash flow approach, where estimates of cash flows are determined from the scheduled payments, adjusted using forecasted prepayment, default and loss given default rates. For non-performing loans, asset liquidation cash flows are derived based on the estimated time to liquidate the loan, the estimated value of the collateral, expected costs and estimated home price levels. Estimated cash flows for both performing and non-performing loans are discounted at yields considered appropriate to arrive at a reasonable exit price for the asset. Indications of loan value such as actual trades, bids, offers and generic market color may be used in determining the appropriate discount yield. The estimation of cash flows used in pricing models is inherently subjective and imprecise. Changes in market conditions, as well as changes in the assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value, could result in a significant increase or decrease in fair value. Residential whole loans, at fair value are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and changes in their fair value are recorded through earnings. With respect to Residential whole loans, at carrying value, the fair value for these loans is disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements and changes in their fair value do not impact earnings. Recent Accounting Standards to Be Adopted in Future Periods We are not aware of any recent accounting standards to be adopted in future periods that we expect would materially impact us. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of cash generally consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements and other collateralized financings, payments of principal and interest we receive on our investment portfolio, cash generated from our operating results and, to the extent such transactions are entered into, proceeds from capital market and structured financing transactions. Our most significant uses of cash are generally to pay principal and interest on our financing transactions, to purchase and originate residential mortgage assets, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, to fund our operations, to meet margin calls and to make other investments that we consider appropriate. We seek to employ a diverse capital raising strategy under which we may issue capital stock and other types of securities. To the extent we raise additional funds through capital market transactions, we currently anticipate using the net proceeds from such transactions to acquire additional residential mortgage-related assets, consistent with our investment policy, and for working capital, which may include, among other things, the repayment of our financing transactions. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to access the capital markets at any particular time or on any particular terms. We have available for issuance an unlimited amount (subject to the terms and limitations of our charter) of common stock, preferred stock, depository shares representing preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, rights and/or units pursuant to our automatic shelf registration statement and, at December 31, 2021, we had approximately 8.3 million shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to our DRSPP shelf registration statement. During 2021, we issued 431,699 shares of common stock through our DRSPP, raising net proceeds of approximately $1.9 million. During 2021, we did not sell any shares of common stock through our at-the-market equity offering program. 59 Table of Contents During 2021, we repurchased 20,101,494 shares of our common stock through the stock repurchase program at an average cost of $4.26 per share and a total cost of approximately $85.6 million, net of fees and commissions paid to the sales agents of approximately $201,000. At December 31, 2021, approximately $80.3 million remained outstanding for future repurchases under the repurchase program. Financing agreements Our borrowings under financing agreements include a combination of shorter term and longer arrangements. Certain of these arrangements are collateralized directly by our residential mortgage investments or otherwise have recourse to us, while securitized debt financing is non-recourse financing. Further, certain of our financing agreements contain terms that allow the lender to make margin calls on us based on changes in the value of the underlying collateral securing the borrowing. As of December 31, 2021, we had $2.6 billion of total unpaid principal balance related to asset-backed financing agreements with mark-to-market collateral provisions and $3.6 billion of total unpaid principal balance related to asset-backed financing agreements that do not include mark-to-market collateral provisions. Repurchase agreements and other forms of collateralized financing are renewable at the discretion of our lenders and, as such, our lenders could determine to reduce or terminate our access to future borrowings at virtually any time. The terms of the repurchase transaction borrowings under our master repurchase agreements, as such terms relate to repayment, margin requirements and the segregation of all securities that are the subject of repurchase transactions, generally conform to the terms contained in the standard master repurchase agreement published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (or SIFMA) or the global master repurchase agreement published by SIFMA and the International Capital Market Association. In addition, each lender typically requires that we include supplemental terms and conditions to the standard master repurchase agreement. Typical supplemental terms and conditions, which differ by lender, may include changes to the margin maintenance requirements, required haircuts (or the percentage amount by which the collateral value is contractually required to exceed the loan amount), purchase price maintenance requirements, requirements that all controversies related to the repurchase agreement be litigated in a particular jurisdiction and cross default and setoff provisions. Other non-repurchase agreement financing arrangements also contain provisions governing collateral maintenance. With respect to margin maintenance requirements for agreements secured by harder to value assets, such as residential whole loans, Non-Agency MBS and MSR-related assets, margin calls are typically determined by our counterparties based on their assessment of changes in the fair value of the underlying collateral and in accordance with the agreed upon haircuts specified in the transaction confirmation with the counterparty. We address margin call requests in accordance with the required terms specified in the applicable agreement and such requests are typically satisfied by posting additional cash or collateral on the same business day. We review margin calls made by counterparties and assess them for reasonableness by comparing the counterparty valuation against our valuation determination. When we believe that a margin call is unnecessary because our assessment of collateral value differs from the counterparty valuation, we typically hold discussions with the counterparty and are able to resolve the matter. If this is not successful, we will look to resolve the dispute based on the remedies available to us under the terms of the repurchase agreement, which in some instances may include the engagement of a third-party to review collateral valuations. For certain other agreements that do not include such provisions, we could resolve the matter by substituting collateral as permitted in accordance with the agreement or otherwise request the counterparty to return the collateral in exchange for cash to unwind the financing. For additional information regarding our various types of financing arrangements, including those with non-mark-to-market terms and the haircuts for those agreements with mark-to-market collateral provisions, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We expect that we will continue to pledge residential mortgage assets as part of certain of our ongoing financing arrangements. When the value of our residential mortgage assets pledged as collateral experiences rapid decreases, margin calls under our financing arrangements could materially increase, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position. Additionally, if one or more of our financing counterparties choose not to provide ongoing funding, our ability to finance our long-maturity assets would decline or otherwise become available on possibly less advantageous terms. Further, when liquidity tightens, our counterparties to our short term arrangements with mark-to-market collateral provisions may increase their required collateral cushion (or margin) requirements on new financings, including financings that we roll with the same counterparty, thereby reducing our ability to use leverage. Access to financing may also be negatively impacted by ongoing volatility in financial markets, thereby potentially adversely impacting our current or future lenders ability or willingness to provide us with financing. In addition, there is no assurance that favorable market conditions will exist to permit us to consummate additional securitization transactions if we determine to seek that form of financing. 60 Table of Contents Our ability to meet future margin calls will be affected by our ability to use cash or obtain financing from unpledged collateral, the amount of which can vary based on the market value of such collateral, our cash position and margin requirements. Our cash position fluctuates based on the timing of our operating, investing and financing activities and is managed based on our anticipated cash needs. (See Interest Rate Risk included under Item 7A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) At December 31, 2021, we had a total of $4.9 billion of residential whole loans and securities and $10.2 million of restricted cash pledged to our financing counterparties. At December 31, 2021, we had access to various sources of liquidity, including $304.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our sources of liquidity do not include restricted cash. In addition, at December 31, 2021, we had $280.2 million of unencumbered residential whole loans. Further, we believe that we have unused capacity in certain borrowing lines, given that the amount currently borrowed is less than the maximum advance rate permitted by the facility.

In connection with our repurchase agreement financings and Swaps, we routinely receive margin calls/reverse margin calls from our counterparties and make margin calls to our counterparties. Margin calls and reverse margin calls, which requirements vary over time, may occur daily between us and any of our counterparties when the value of collateral pledged changes from the amount contractually required. The value of securities pledged as collateral fluctuates reflecting changes in: (i) the face (or par) value of our assets; (ii) market interest rates and/or other market conditions; and (iii) the market value of our Swaps. Margin calls/reverse margin calls are satisfied when we pledge/receive additional collateral in the form of additional assets and/or cash. The table below summarizes our margin activity with respect to our repurchase agreement financings and derivative hedging instruments for the quarterly periods presented: Collateral Pledged to Meet Margin Calls Cash and Securities Received for Reverse Margin Calls Net Assets Received/(Pledged) for Margin Activity For the Quarter Ended (1) Fair Value of Securities Pledged Cash Pledged Aggregate Assets Pledged For Margin Calls (In Thousands) December 31, 2021 $ $ 14,446 $ 14,446 $ 2,000 $ (12,446) September 30, 2021 2,500 2,500 June 30, 2021 3,433 3,433 (3,433) March 31, 2021 (1) Excludes variation margin payments on our cleared Swaps which are treated as a legal settlement of the exposure under the Swap contract.
