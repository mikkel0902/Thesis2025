Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read together with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The discussion below contains management's comments on our business strategy and outlook, and such discussions contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the expectations, beliefs, plans, and objectives of management about future financial performance and assumptions underlying management's judgment concerning the matters discussed, and accordingly involve estimates, assumptions, judgments, and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements, and the discussion below is not necessarily indicative of future results. Factors that could cause or contribute to any differences include but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors and in "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." A discussion comparing our results of operations, backlog, and liquidity and capital resources between fiscal years 2022 and 2021 can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, which we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 22, 2022. Business Overview For an overview of our business, including our business segments and discussion of the services we provide, see Item 1. Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Financial Overview A number of factors have affected our fiscal year 2023 results, the most significant of which we have listed below. More detail on these changes is presented below within our "Results of Operations" section. Our operations within the United States received the benefit of contract growth, including a return to redetermination activity. As redetermination activity resumed during the year, this provided a benefit to both revenue and profit as volumes increased to match our resources. Our Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") cost base has expanded with the growth of the business, including investments in our workforce and business infrastructure. In addition, we recorded $29.3 million as the estimated costs for the investigation and remediation of a cybersecurity incident, $0.9 million related to the disposal of two businesses in fiscal year 2023, and $2.9 million of charges relating to sales completed in October 2023. The cost of our debt has increased year-over-year as interest rates have risen. The strength of the United States Dollar over the other currencies in which we do business has tempered our results in our Outside the U.S. Segment. 26 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years indicated, information derived from our statements of operations. In preparing our discussion and analysis of these results, we focused on the comparison between fiscal years 2023 and 2022. Table MD&A 1: Consolidated Results of Operations For the Year Ended September 30, 2023 2022 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Revenue $ 4,904,728 $ 4,631,018 Cost of revenue 3,876,120 3,691,208 Gross profit 1,028,608 939,810 Gross profit percentage 21.0 % 20.3 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses 639,223 534,493 Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue 13.0 % 11.5 % Amortization of intangible assets 94,591 90,465 Gain on sale of land and building 11,046 Operating income 294,794 325,898 Operating margin 6.0 % 7.0 % Interest expense 84,138 45,965 Other expense, net 363 2,835 Income before income taxes 210,293 277,098 Provision for income taxes 48,501 73,270 Effective tax rate 23.1 % 26.4 % Net income $ 161,792 $ 203,828 Earnings per share: Basic $ 2.65 $ 3.30 Diluted $ 2.63 $ 3.29 Our business segments have different factors driving revenue fluctuations and profitability. The sections that follow cover these segments in greater detail. Our revenue reflects fees earned for services provided. Cost of revenue consists of direct costs related to labor and related overhead, subcontractor labor, outside vendors, rent, and other direct costs. The largest component of cost of revenue, approximately two-thirds, is labor, including subcontracted labor. Table MD&A 2: Changes in Revenue, Cost of Revenue, and Gross Profit for the Year Ended September 30, 2023 Revenue Cost of Revenue Gross Profit Dollars % Change Dollars % Change Dollars % Change (dollars in thousands) Fiscal year 2022 $ 4,631,018 $ 3,691,208 $ 939,810 Organic effect 326,745 7.1 % 235,859 6.4 % 90,886 9.7 % Disposal of businesses (22,050) (0.5) % (22,799) (0.6) % 749 0.1 % Acquired growth 4,179 0.1 % 2,297 0.1 % 1,882 0.2 % Currency effect compared to the prior period (35,164) (0.8) % (30,445) (0.8) % (4,719) (0.5) % Fiscal year 2023 $ 4,904,728 5.9 % $ 3,876,120 5.0 % $ 1,028,608 9.4 % 27 Table of Contents Selling, general, and administrative expenses Our SG&A expenses consist of indirect costs related to general management, marketing, and administration. It is primarily composed of labor costs. These costs may be incurred at a segment level, for dedicated resources that are not client-facing, or at a corporate level. Corporate costs are allocated to segments on a consistent and rational basis. Fluctuations in our SG&A are primarily driven by changes in our administrative cost base, which is not directly driven by changes in our revenue. As part of our work for the U.S. federal government and many states, we allocate these costs using a methodology driven by the U.S. Federal Cost Accounting Standards. Our SG&A expenses have expanded through our growth, as well as investments made in our workforce and infrastructure. In addition, our SG&A includes charges which are not directly connected to our day-to-day operations. Our costs for the year ended September 30, 2023, include a $29.3 million expense incurred in the second half of the year for our best estimate of the investigation and remediation costs of a previously disclosed cybersecurity incident. As previously disclosed, the Company believes that the personal information of a significant number of individuals was accessed by an unauthorized third party by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in a file transfer application used by the Company for internal and external file sharing purposes. We have provided notices to individuals whose personal information, including social security numbers, protected health information, and/or other personal information, may have been included in the impacted files. We include costs related to our acquisitions within SG&A. For the year ended September 30, 2023, we increased anticipated consideration for our Aidvantage business, which we acquired in fiscal year 2022, for consideration based upon future performance. Our SG&A expense for the year ended September 30, 2023 also includes losses of $0.9 million relating to the sale of two small businesses and $2.9 million related to assets in businesses that were sold subsequent to year end. Interest expense Interest expense for fiscal year 2023 and 2022 increased from $46.0 million to $84.1 million. This increase is principally due to market rate increases. Our effective interest rate was 5.97% at September 30, 2023, compared to 4.69% at September 30, 2022, and 2.05% at September 30, 2021. We have mitigated our risk by fixing interest rates on $650 million of our debt and our near-term capital allocation plan continues to prioritize reducing our debt using our free cash flow. At our current debt balances, a 100 basis point change in SOFR would result in an increased annual interest expense of $6.1 million. Income taxes Our effective income tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, was 23.1% and 26.4 %, respectively. The decrease in tax rate was primarily driven by higher tax credits and stock vesting benefits in the US, as well as a mix of jurisdictions where we recorded profit. For fiscal year 2024, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 24.5% and 25.5%. 28 Table of Contents U.S. Federal Services Segment Our U.S. Federal Services Segment delivers end-to-end solutions that help various U.S. federal government agencies better deliver on their mission, including program operations and management, clinical services, and technology solutions. This segment also includes appeals and assessments services, system and application development, Information Technology ("IT") modernization, and maintenance services. Certain state-based assessments and appeals work that is part of the segment's heritage continues to be managed within this segment. Under Technology Consulting Services ("TCS"), the segment executes on its digital strategy to deliver technology solutions that advance agency missions, including the challenge to modernize, provide better customer experience, and drive process efficiencies. The segment continues to expand its clinical solutions through VES, which manages the clinical evaluation process for U.S. veterans and service members on behalf of the VA. Table MD&A 3: U.S. Federal Services Segment - Financial Results For the Year Ended September 30, 2023 2022 (dollars in thousands) Revenue $ 2,403,606 $ 2,259,744 Cost of revenue 1,845,720 1,740,304 Gross profit 557,886 519,440 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 308,197 284,509 Operating income 249,689 234,931 Gross profit percentage 23.2 % 23.0 % Operating margin percentage 10.4 % 10.4 % Our results for the year ended September 30, 2023, received revenue growth from Aidvantage and the increased volume on the VA medical disability examination ("MDE") contracts. Profitability improvements from the VA MDE contracts were partially offset by our need to ramp up staffing for these contracts during the early part of the year in anticipation of the current higher volumes. We anticipate that the growth in fiscal year 2023 will continue into fiscal year 2024, continuing to receive the benefit of new and expanded work on the VA MDE contracts. Operating margins are expected to range between 11% and 12% as the volume of work in the VA MDE contracts and the Aidvantage student loan business rises to meet our staffing levels. Although a shutdown by the U.S. federal government may create challenges for our business, particularly if payments are delayed, we believe that a significant majority of our work is considered "essential" by the government and would be expected to have minimal disruption. U.S. Services Segment Our U.S. Services Segment provides a variety of BPS, such as program administration, assessments, and related consulting work for U.S. state and local government programs. These services support a variety of programs, including the ACA, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program ("CHIP"), Temporary Assistance to Needy Families ("TANF"), and child support programs. Over the last three years, many programs in this segment have been operating with depressed margins resulting from the pause in Medicaid redeterminations. The depressed margins have resulted from reduced operating leverage in the segment as costs cannot scale down at the same rate to meet lower demand due to requirements to fulfill other obligations on these contracts. With the resumption of redeterminations, we expect a full period of volumes in 2024 coming back into these programs, enabling our operating leverage to recover. 29 Table of Contents Table MD&A 4: U.S. Services Segment - Financial Results For the Year Ended September 30, 2023 2022 (dollars in thousands) Revenue $ 1,812,069 $ 1,607,612 Cost of revenue 1,434,528 1,264,608 Gross profit 377,541 343,004 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 194,991 160,902 Operating income 182,550 182,102 Gross profit percentage 20.8 % 21.3 % Operating margin percentage 10.1 % 11.3 % Our revenue and cost of revenue for the year ended September 30, 2023, increased 12.7% and 13.4%, respectively, compared to fiscal year 2022. All movement was organic. This segment received the benefit of the return of Medicaid eligibility redetermination work towards the latter half of the year; this work had previously been suspended or reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This resumed work, as well as new work and the conversion of short-term arrangements into long-term contracts, boosted profit margins in the latter half of the year. We believe our redetermination work will continue to resume in fiscal year 2024, offsetting losses of the final pieces of COVID-19 pandemic revenue, which we recorded in early fiscal year 2023. We expect our full-year profit margin to be approximately 11% as the level of work performed moves up to match our base staffing levels. Outside the U.S. Segment Our Outside the U.S. Segment provides BPS for international governments, transforming the lives of people around the world. Helping people find employment, access vital support, and remain healthy, these services include health and disability assessments, program administration for employment services, wellbeing solutions, and other job seeker-related services. We support programs and deliver services in the United Kingdom, including the Health Assessment Advisory Service ("HAAS") and the recently awarded replacement contract to start in 2024, Functional Assessment Services ( FAS ), and Restart; Australia, including Workforce Australia and employment support and job seeker services worldwide. Table MD&A 5: Outside the U.S. Segment - Financial Results For the Year Ended September 30, 2023 2022 (dollars in thousands) Revenue $ 689,053 $ 763,662 Cost of revenue 595,872 686,296 Gross profit 93,181 77,366 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 102,311 92,536 Operating loss (9,130) (15,170) Gross profit percentage 13.5 % 10.1 % Operating margin percentage (1.3) % (2.0) % 30 Table of Contents Table MD&A 6: Outside the U.S. Segment - Changes in Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit Revenue Cost of Revenue Gross Profit Amount % Change Amount % Change Amount % Change (dollars in thousands) Balance for fiscal year 2022 $ 763,662 $ 686,296 $ 77,366 Organic effect (21,574) (2.8) % (39,477) (5.8) % 17,903 23.1 % Disposal of businesses (22,050) (2.9) % (22,799) (3.3) % 749 1.0 % Acquired growth 4,179 0.5 % 2,297 0.3 % 1,882 2.4 % Currency effect compared to the prior period (35,164) (4.6) % (30,445) (4.4) % (4,719) (6.1) % Balance for fiscal year 2023 $ 689,053 (9.8) % $ 595,872 (13.2) % $ 93,181 20.4 % Our results for fiscal year 2023 were tempered by challenges within our welfare-to-work services, both at the macroeconomic level, where markets with low unemployment reduce the demand for our services, and at a contract level, where the reduction in scope of our Australian contract has reduced both revenue and profitability. In March 2023, we sold a small commercial practice in the United Kingdom and our employment operations in Sweden. Prospectively, we anticipate this will marginally improve our profit margins. This segment also experienced declines in revenue and cost from currency movements, with the major currencies in which we do business declining year-over-year against the United States Dollar. Much of our revenue growth stems from our employment services contracts, where we are paid based upon our ability to place individuals in long-term sustained employment. We recognize revenue over our period of performance, using estimates of our ability to place people in work and the time that this will take. Our estimates are based upon historical performance, where appropriate and available, and are constantly updated. This may result in volatility within revenue as changes in estimates of future performance impact the revenue recognized in any period. We are continuing our efforts to improve the performance of this segment. Subsequent to September 30, 2023, we sold our businesses in Italy and Singapore, as well as part of our business in Canada. These businesses had provided approximately $28 million of revenue and a gross loss of $3 million in fiscal year 2023. With these disposals, we anticipate that this segment will break even at an operating margin level in fiscal year 2024. As we establish our plans for fiscal year 2024 and beyond, the actions we consider may result in additional charges, including impairment of assets. 31 Table of Contents Backlog Backlog represents estimated future revenue from: existing signed contracts; contracts that have been awarded but not yet signed; and unexercised priced contract options. As of September 30, 2023, we estimate that we had approximately $20.7 billion in backlog. Table MD&A 7: Backlog by Segment As of September 30, 2023 2022 (in millions) U.S. Federal Services $ 13,800 $ 13,168 U.S. Services 4,851 5,205 Outside the U.S. 2,089 1,441 Backlog $ 20,740 $ 19,814 At September 30, 2023, the average weighted remaining life of the contracts in our backlog was approximately 5.92 years, including option periods. Increases in backlog result from the award of new contracts and the extension or renewal of existing contracts. Reductions in backlog come from fulfilling contracts or the early termination of contracts, which our experience shows to be a rare occurrence. See "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Annual Report. The backlog associated with our performance-based contracts is an estimate based upon management's experience of caseloads and similar transaction volume, which is subject to revision based upon the latest information available. Additionally, backlog estimates may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations. We believe that comparisons of backlog period-to-period are difficult. We also believe that it is difficult to predict future revenue solely based on analysis of backlog. The actual timing of revenue from projects included in backlog will vary. We also may experience periods in which there is a greater concentration of rebids, resulting in a comparatively reduced backlog balance until subsequent award or extension on those contracts. The longevity of these contracts assists management in predicting revenue, operating income, and cash flows for the purposes of business planning. We expect approximately 24% of the backlog balance to be realized as revenue in fiscal year 2024. Our standard forecasting process includes analyzing new work pipelines and submitted responses to requests for proposals ("RFPs") when predicting future revenue, operating income, and cash flows. 32 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash from operations, and availability under our revolving credit facilities. As of September 30, 2023, we had $65.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our current cash position, access to our revolvers, and cash flow generated from operations should be not only sufficient for our operating requirements but also to enable us to fund required long-term debt repayments, dividends, and any share purchases we might choose to make. We believe we have access to sufficient funds to manage through a potential shutdown of the U.S. federal government. See "Note 8. Debt and Derivatives" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our debt financing arrangements. During fiscal year 2023, we entered into a number of debt-related transactions. We entered into additional interest rate swaps to bring the total balance of our credit facility subject to fixed rates to $650 million. This allows us greater opportunity to predict and manage our interest payments. We amended both our debt and the corresponding interest rate swaps to use interest rates based upon the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), replacing the previous LIBOR basis. As part of the transition to SOFR, we redeemed some of our Term Loan B debt. We have included the following table showing our debt balances as of September 30, 2023, and their effective interest rates. Table MD&A 8: Debt Balances and Interest Rates as of September 30, 2023 September 30, 2023 Carrying value Effective cash interest rate Interest rate basis (dollars in thousands) Term Loan A - Unhedged $ 259,375 6.92 % Term SOFR reset monthly plus margin. (1) Term Loan A - Hedged through May 2026 500,000 3.81 % Fixed rate of 2.31% plus margin. (1) Term Loan A - Hedged through September 2024 150,000 5.98 % Fixed rate of 4.48% plus margin. (1) Term Loan B 344,934 7.42 % Term SOFR (variable reset) plus 2% margin. Debt held by international subsidiaries 3,220 6.08 % Floating rate, reset quarterly. Debt Principal $ 1,257,529 (1) Applicable margin ranges between 1% and 2%, based on our leverage ratio. Our effective cash interest rate reflects the drivers of our cash interest payments as of September 30, 2023, which can change based upon the reset of the rates. Including the amortization of the upfront payments, our effective interest rate as of September 30, 2023 is 5.97%. The below table summarizes our change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Table MD&A 9: Net Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash For the Year Ended September 30, 2023 2022 (in thousands) Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 314,340 $ 289,839 Net cash used in investing activities (80,963) (54,009) Net cash used in financing activities (250,798) (248,271) Effect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 2,717 (7,334) Net change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (14,704) $ (19,775) 33 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $24.5 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. Although our net income declined year-over-year, our operating cash flows received the benefit from favorable timing of vendor payments. This benefit was partially offset by higher interest payments, with a cash outflow of $81.1 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to $43.1 million in the comparative period. Both years have received the benefit of faster cash collections. Our Days Sales Outstanding ("DSO") improved from September 30, 2021, when it was 68 days, through September 30, 2022 (62 days) and September 30, 2023 (60 days). Net Cash Used In Investing Activities Investing activities in fiscal year 2023 included ongoing capital investment in fixed assets and software. We received payments for the sales of our Swedish business and for our sale of a small commercial practice in the United Kingdom. Net Cash Used In Financing Activities The principal drivers of financing cash flows are the Credit Agreement, our equity transactions, and restricted cash flows where we hold funds on behalf of customers or vendors. During both fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we utilized our operating cash inflows to pay down debt and pay our dividends. In fiscal year 2022, we also used funds to purchase Maximus common stock. In fiscal year 2022, we received the benefit from our Receivables Purchase Agreement ("RPA"), under which we can sell certain US-originated accounts receivable balances. Prior to September 30, 2022, we sold a customer invoice for $60.4 million. Although we sold these receivables, we maintained administrative responsibilities over cash collection. Having sold the invoice, the customer payment was received on September 30, 2022, and was treated as restricted cash before being remitted to Wells Fargo in October 2022. This resulted in a large financing cash inflow in fiscal year 2022, and a corresponding outflow in fiscal year 2023. Cash in Foreign Locations We have no requirement to remit funds from our foreign locations to the United States. We will continue to explore opportunities to remit additional funds, taking into consideration the working capital requirements and relevant tax rules in each jurisdiction. When we are unable to remit funds back without incurring a penalty, we will consider these funds indefinitely reinvested until such time as these restrictions are changed. As a result, we do not record U.S. deferred income taxes on any funds held in foreign jurisdictions. We have not attempted to calculate our potential liability from any transfer of these funds, as any such transaction might include tax planning strategies that we have not fully explored. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate the potential tax obligations if we were to remit all of our funds from foreign locations to the United States. Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) Table MD&A 10: Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) For the Year Ended September 30, 2023 2022 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 314,340 $ 289,839 Purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software (90,695) (56,145) Free cash flow (Non-GAAP) $ 223,645 $ 233,694 Material Cash Requirements from Contractual Obligations Credit Facilities Our principal debt agreement is with JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (the "Credit Agreement"). At September 30, 2023, we owed $1.25 billion under the Credit Agreement, with access to an additional $600.0 million through a revolving credit facility. Mandatory repayments are required under this agreement through May 2028, when the agreement ends, and must be renegotiated or the funds repaid. 34 Table of Contents The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants with which we are expected to comply. Failure to meet these requirements would result in a need to renegotiate the agreement or a requirement to repay our outstanding debt in full. There are two financial covenants, both defined in the Credit Agreement. Our Consolidated Net Total Leverage Ratio means, for any twelve-month period, the ratio of our Funded Debt, offset by up to $75 million of unrestricted cash (Consolidated Total Leverage), against our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined by the Credit Agreement). To comply with our Credit Agreement, this ratio cannot exceed 4.00:1.00 at the end of each quarter, with a step up to 4.50:1.00 under certain circumstances. This ratio also determines both our interest rate and the charge we pay on the unused component of our revolving credit facility, with the charge increasing as the leverage ratio increases. Our Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio means, for any twelve-month period, the ratio of our Consolidated EBITDA against our Consolidated Net Interest Expense as defined by the Credit Agreement. To comply with our Credit Agreement, this ratio cannot be less than 3.00:1.00 at the end of each quarter. Consolidated EBITDA also drives certain permissions within the Credit Agreement, such as the level of investment we are entitled to make without seeking additional approval from our lenders. Our Credit Agreement defines Consolidated EBITDA, as well as other components of the calculations above. The definition of Consolidated EBITDA requires us to include adjustments not typically included within EBITDA, including unusual, non-recurring expenses, certain non-cash adjustments, the pro forma effects of acquisitions and disposals, and estimated synergies from acquisitions. As a result, Consolidated EBITDA as defined by the Credit Agreement may not be comparable to EBITDA or related or similarly-titled measures presented by other companies. We have summarized below the components of our two financial ratio calculations, including the components of Consolidated EBITDA as defined by the Credit Agreement, which are included within our financial statements. At September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants of our Credit Agreement. We do not believe that these covenants represent a significant restriction in our ability to operate our business or to pay our dividends.

These balances represent our contractual obligation to make future payments on our leases, discounted to reflect our cost of borrowing. The majority of these leases are for real estate. In the event that we vacate a location, we may be obligated to continue making lease payments. Where possible, we mitigate this risk by including clauses allowing for the termination of lease agreements if the contract the location covers is terminated by our customer. See "Note 10. Leases" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our leases, including obligations by fiscal year. Deferred compensation plan As of September 30, 2023, we reported liabilities of $46.4 million related to our deferred compensation plan. These balances are due to our employees based upon elections they make at the time of deferring their funds. The timing of these payments may change based upon factors, including termination of our employment arrangement with a participant. We maintain a rabbi trust to fund this liability. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We consider the accounting policies below to be the most important to our financial position and results of operations either because of the significance of the financial statement item or because of the need to use significant judgment in recording the balance. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in "Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies" of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition Although much of our revenue is recognized concurrently with billing or with the passage of time, some of our revenue requires us to make estimates. These estimates are reviewed quarterly, with any changes being recorded as a cumulative catch-up. Some of our performance-based contract revenue is recognized based upon future milestones defined in each contract. This is the case in many of our employment services contracts in the Outside the U.S. Segment, where we are paid as individuals attain employment milestones, which may take many months to achieve. We recognize revenue over the period of performance. Our estimates vary from contract to contract but may include the number of participants within a portfolio reaching employment milestones and the service delivery periods for participants reaching the employment milestone. We estimate the total variable fees we will receive using the expected value method. We recognize the fees over the expected period of performance. At each reporting period, we update our estimates of the variable fees to represent the circumstances present at the end of the reporting period. We are required to constrain our estimates to the extent that it is probable that there will not be a significant reversal of cumulative revenue when the uncertainty is resolved. We do not 36 Table of Contents have a history of significant constraints on these contracts. During the year ended September 30, 2023, we recognized revenue from these performance-based fees of $120.6 million. At September 30, 2023, we recorded $53.9 million of these estimated outcome fees as unbilled receivables, which will be billed and then collected when we reach the targets we anticipate. Business Combinations and Goodwill Our balance sheet as of September 30, 2023, includes $1.78 billion of goodwill and $703.6 million of net intangible assets. These assets are created through business acquisitions, and their creation and maintenance requires certain critical estimates. During an acquisition, we are required to estimate the fair value of all acquired tangible and intangible assets, as well as liabilities assumed, in order to allocate the purchase price. For many assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the calculation of fair value requires little judgment as balances may be readily convertible to cash receipts or cash payments, or there may be an active market against which to measure value. For the valuation of intangible assets, significant judgment is necessary in identifying and valuing such assets. This valuation will also involve identifying the useful economic life of this asset. Our estimates of these fair values and useful economic lives are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable and, where appropriate, include assistance from third-party appraisal firms. The accounting for our acquisitions included determining the fair value of intangible assets representing customer relationships, the VES provider network, and technology. In making our determination of the fair value of these assets, we utilized estimates, the most significant of which were forecasts related to future revenues and profit margins. These assumptions relate to the future performance of the acquired business, are forward-looking, and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. The asset values and asset lives determined at acquisition may change based upon circumstances such as contract terminations or changes in strategy. When this occurs, we may need to accelerate our amortization charges. These assets are also subject to impairment if events indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. For example, our intangible asset balance includes customer relationship assets which, if the customer relationship ends, would require evaluation of the remaining asset life and asset value. The excess purchase price over the identified net assets is considered to be goodwill. Goodwill is recorded at the reporting unit level. The identification of our reporting units requires judgment based upon the manner in which our business is operated and the services performed. Our reporting units are consistent with our segments. Where we have acquisitions that provide services to more than one segment or where the acquisition provides benefits across all of our segments, we use judgment to allocate the goodwill balance based upon the relative value we anticipate that each segment will realize. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level. This process requires judgment in assessing the fair value of these reporting units. We performed the annual impairment test using the qualitative assessment as of July 1, 2023, and concluded that the fair value of each of the reporting units were greater than the carrying amounts. Contingencies From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, including contract and employment claims, in the ordinary course of business. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these contingencies, as well as potential ranges of probable losses, and establish reserves accordingly. The amount of reserves required may change in future periods due to new developments or changes in approach to a matter, such as a change in settlement strategy. We are also subject to audits by our government clients on many of our contracts based upon measures such as costs incurred or transactions processed. These audits may take place several years after a contract has been completed. We maintain reserves where we believe a loss is probable and are able to estimate any potential liability that is updated as audits are completed. 37 Table of Contents Non-GAAP and Other Measures We utilize non-GAAP measures where we believe it will assist users of our financial statements in understanding our business. The presentation of these measures is meant to complement, but not replace, other financial measures in this document. The presentation of non-GAAP numbers is not meant to be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to revenue growth, net cash provided by operating activities, operating income, net income, or earnings per share as measures of performance or liquidity. These non-GAAP measures, as determined and presented by us, may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures presented by other companies. In fiscal year 2023, 14% of our revenue was generated outside the U.S. We believe that users of our financial statements wish to understand the performance of our foreign operations using a methodology that excludes the effect of year-over-year exchange rate fluctuations. To calculate year-over-year currency movement, we determine the current fiscal year's results for all foreign businesses using the exchange rates in the prior fiscal year. In recent years, we have made a number of acquisitions. We believe users of our financial statements wish to evaluate the performance of our operations, excluding changes that have arisen due to businesses acquired or disposed of. We identify acquired revenue and cost of revenue by showing these results for periods for which no comparative results exist within our financial statements. We identify revenue and cost of revenue that has been disposed of in a similar manner. This information is supplemented by our calculations of organic growth. To calculate organic growth, we compare current fiscal year results, excluding transactions from acquisitions or disposals, to our prior fiscal year results. Our recent acquisitions have resulted in significant intangible assets, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We believe users of our financial statements wish to understand the performance of the business by using a methodology that excludes the amortization of our intangible assets. During fiscal year 2023, we have also incurred losses on sales of businesses and taken an impairment charge on a business sold in early fiscal year 2024. We believe that providing supplemental measures that exclude the impact of the items detailed below is useful to investors in evaluating our core operations and results in relation to past periods. Accordingly, we have calculated our operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share, excluding the effect of the amortization of intangible assets and divestiture-related charges. We have included a table showing our reconciliation of these income measures to their corresponding GAAP measures. Table MD&A 14: Non-GAAP Adjusted Results - Operating Income, Net Income, and Diluted Earnings per Share For the Year Ended September 30, 2023 2022 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Operating income $ 294,794 $ 325,898 Add back: Amortization of intangible assets 94,591 90,465 Add back: Divestiture-related charges 3,751 Adjusted operating income excluding amortization of intangible assets and divestiture-related charges (Non-GAAP) $ 393,136 $ 416,363 Adjusted operating income margin excluding amortization of intangible assets and divestiture-related charges (Non-GAAP) 8.0 % 9.0 % Net income $ 161,792 $ 203,828 Add back: Amortization of intangible assets, net of tax 69,714 66,786 Add back: Divestiture-related charges 3,751 Adjusted net income excluding amortization of intangible assets and divestiture-related charges (Non-GAAP) $ 235,257 $ 270,614 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.63 $ 3.29 Add back: Effect of amortization of intangible assets on diluted earnings per share 1.14 1.08 Add back: Effect of divestiture-related charges on diluted earnings per share 0.06 Adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding amortization of intangible assets and divestiture-related charges (Non-GAAP) $ 3.83 $ 4.37 38 Table of Contents In order to sustain our net cash provided by operating activities, we regularly refresh our fixed assets and technology. We believe that users of our financial statements wish to understand the cash flows that directly correspond with our operations and the investments we must make in those operations using a methodology that combines net cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures. We provide free cash flow to complement our consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow shows the effects of our operations and replacement capital expenditures and excludes the cash flow effects of acquisitions, purchases of our common stock, dividend payments, and other financing transactions. We have provided a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow in "Liquidity and Capital Resources." To sustain our operations, our principal source of financing comes from receiving payments from our customers. We believe that users of our financial statements wish to evaluate our efficiency in converting revenue into cash receipts. Accordingly, we provide DSO, which we calculate by dividing billed and unbilled receivable balances at the end of each quarter by revenue per day for the period. Revenue per day for a quarter is determined by dividing total revenue by 91 days. 39 Table of Contents
