ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") includes the following: an overview that provides a summary of our segments and highlights from fiscal 2024; a more detailed analysis of our results of operations; our capital resources and liquidity, which discusses key aspects of our statements of cash flows, changes in our balance sheets and our financial commitments; and a summary of our critical accounting estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto contained herein. Our MD&A focuses on discussion of year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023. Discussion of fiscal 2022 results and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2023. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview We are one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies, helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care. We deliver innovative programs and services designed to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain in both human and animal health. We are organized geographically based upon the products and services we provide to our customers, and we report our results under two reportable segments: U.S. Healthcare Solutions and International Healthcare Solutions. U.S. Healthcare Solutions Segment The U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment distributes a comprehensive offering of brand-name, specialty brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long-term care and alternate site pharmacies, and other customers. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment also provides pharmaceutical distribution (including plasma and other blood products, injectable pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and other specialty pharmaceutical products) and additional services to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology, and to other healthcare providers, including hospitals and dialysis clinics. Additionally, the U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment provides data analytics, outcomes research, and additional services for biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment also provides pharmacy management, staffing and additional consulting services, and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers. It also provides a full suite of integrated manufacturer services that ranges from clinical trial support to product post-approval and commercialization support. Additionally, it delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers. Through its animal health business, the U.S. Healthcare Solutions reportable segment sells pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, micro feed ingredients, and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets. It also offers demand-creating sales force services to manufacturers. International Healthcare Solutions Segment The International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment consists of businesses that focus on international pharmaceutical wholesale and related service operations and global commercialization services. The International Healthcare Solutions reportable segment distributes pharmaceuticals, other healthcare products, and related services to healthcare providers, including pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals primarily in Europe. It is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry. It is also a provider of specialized services, including regulatory affairs, development consulting and scientific affairs, pharmacovigilance, and quality management and compliance, for the life sciences industry. In Canada, the business drives innovative partnerships with manufacturers, providers, and pharmacies to improve product access and efficiency throughout the healthcare supply chain. 30 Table of Contents Recent Development On November 5, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Retina Consultants of America ("RCA"). Under the terms of the agreement, we will acquire RCA for cash based on an enterprise value of approximately $4.6 billion, subject to a customary working capital and net-debt adjustment. RCA affiliated practices, physicians, and management will rollover a portion of their equity in RCA. After giving effect to the rollover, a cash capitalization of RCA that we intend to make, and the payment of transaction fees and expenses, our expected cash outlay at closing would be approximately $4.3 billion. At closing, we expect to hold approximately 85% ownership in RCA. The agreement also provides for the potential payment of up to $500 million in aggregate contingent consideration in fiscal 2027 and fiscal 2028, subject to the successful completion of certain predefined business objectives. We expect to fund the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and new debt financing and have obtained $3.3 billion in bridge financing commitments in connection with the transaction. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. Executive Summary This executive summary provides highlights from the results of operations that follow: Revenue increased by $31.8 billion, or 12.1%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment grew its revenue by $30.6 billion, or 13.0%, from the prior fiscal year due to overall market growth primarily driven by unit volume growth, including increased sales of products labeled for diabetes and/or weight loss in the glucagon-like peptide-1, or "GLP-1," class, increased sales of specialty products to physician practices and health systems, and increased sales of COVID-19 therapies and vaccines. International Healthcare Solutions' revenue increased by $1.2 billion, or 4.4%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased sales at Alliance Healthcare, our European distribution business, and increased sales at our Canadian business. Gross profit increased by $950.5 million, or 10.6%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increases in gross profit in both reportable segments and a last-in, first-out ("LIFO") credit in the current fiscal year in comparison to LIFO expense in the prior fiscal year, offset in part by lower gains from antitrust litigation settlements. U.S. Healthcare Solutions' gross profit increased by $602.0 million, or 10.3%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased sales. Gross profit in International Healthcare Solutions increased $130.1 million, or 4.1%, from the prior fiscal year due to growth at all of its businesses. Total operating expenses increased by $1,116.0 million, or 16.9%, from the prior fiscal year due to a $418.0 million goodwill impairment related to PharmaLex and increases in (i) distribution, selling, and administrative expenses, (ii) litigation and opioid-related expenses, which was a credit in the prior year fiscal year due to the receipt of funds previously held in an opioid indemnity escrow account, and (iii) amortization expense. Total segment operating income increased by $359.1 million, or 10.9%, from the prior fiscal year. U.S. Healthcare Solutions' operating income increased by $338.3 million, or 13.0%, from prior fiscal year, and International Healthcare Solutions' operating income increased by $20.8 million, or 3.0%, from the prior fiscal year. Our effective tax rates were 24.2% and 19.8% in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2024 was higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the PharmaLex goodwill impairment, which is largely not deductible for income tax purposes, and U.S. state income taxes, offset in part by the discrete tax benefits associated with foreign valuation allowance adjustments, the benefit of non-U.S. income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, and tax benefits associated with equity compensation. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2023 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of non-U.S. income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, benefits from tax authority audit resolutions, and tax benefits associated with equity compensation, offset in part by U.S. state income taxes. 31 Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023 Revenue Fiscal Year Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change U.S. Healthcare Solutions Human Health $ 259,973,909 $ 229,716,669 13.2% Animal Health 5,365,518 5,042,549 6.4% Total U.S. Healthcare Solutions 265,339,427 234,759,218 13.0% International Healthcare Solutions Alliance Healthcare 23,061,721 22,349,278 3.2% Other Healthcare Solutions 5,565,821 5,069,401 9.8% Total International Solutions 28,627,542 27,418,679 4.4% Intersegment eliminations (8,370) (4,486) Revenue $ 293,958,599 $ 262,173,411 12.1% Our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors, such as industry growth trends, including drug utilization (e.g., products labeled for diabetes and/or weight loss in the GLP-1 class), the introduction of new, innovative brand therapies and vaccines, the likely increase in the number of generic drugs and biosimilars that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs and biosimilars, price inflation and price deflation, general economic conditions in the United States and Europe, currency exchange rates, competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased downward pressure on government and other third-party reimbursement rates to our customers, and changes in government rules and regulations. Revenue increased by $31.8 billion, or 12.1%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment grew its revenue by $30.6 billion, or 13.0%, from the prior fiscal year due to overall market growth primarily driven by unit volume growth, including increased sales of $8.6 billion, or 43.4%, of products labeled for diabetes and/or weight loss in the GLP-1 class, increased sales of specialty products to physician practices and health systems, and increased sales of COVID-19 therapies and vaccines. Sales, including GLP-1 products and COVID-19 vaccines, to our two largest customers increased by $11.3 billion from the prior fiscal year. International Healthcare Solutions' revenue increased by $1.2 billion, or 4.4%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased sales of $0.7 billion at our European distribution business and increased sales of $0.4 billion at our Canadian business. A number of our contracts with customers, including group purchasing organizations, are typically subject to expiration each year. We may lose a key customer if an existing contract with such customer expires without being extended, renewed, or replaced. During fiscal 2024, no key contracts expired. Additionally, from time to time, key contracts may be terminated in accordance with their terms or extended, renewed, or replaced prior to their expiration dates. If those contracts are extended, renewed, or replaced at less favorable terms, they may also negatively impact our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. We anticipate a potential June 2025 loss of an oncology customer following its recently announced pending acquisition. In September 2024, we extended our pharmaceutical supply agreement with Evernorth Health Services (formerly Express Scripts, Inc.) for an additional three years through September 2029. 32 Table of Contents Gross Profit Fiscal Year Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change U.S. Healthcare Solutions $ 6,423,114 $ 5,821,116 10.3% International Healthcare Solutions 3,320,978 3,190,847 4.1% Intersegment eliminations (3,048) Gains from antitrust litigation settlements 170,904 239,092 LIFO credit (expense) 52,168 (204,595) Turkey highly inflationary impact (54,087) (86,967) Gross profit $ 9,910,029 $ 8,959,493 10.6% Gross profit increased by $950.5 million, or 10.6%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increases in gross profit in both reportable segments and a LIFO credit in the current fiscal year in comparison to LIFO expense in the prior fiscal year, offset in part by lower gains from antitrust litigation settlements. U.S. Healthcare Solutions gross profit increased by $602.0 million, or 10.3%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased sales. As a percentage of revenue, U.S. Healthcare Solutions' gross profit margin of 2.42% in the current fiscal year declined 6 basis points compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher sales of GLP-1 products, which have lower gross profit margins, offset in part by increased sales of COVID-19 vaccines, which have higher gross profit margins. Gross profit in International Healthcare Solutions increased $130.1 million, or 4.1%, from the prior fiscal year due to growth at all of its businesses. We recognized gains from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers of $170.9 million and $239.1 million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The gains were recorded as reductions to Cost of Goods Sold (see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our cost of goods sold includes a LIFO provision that is affected by manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, changes in inventory quantities, and product mix, many of which are difficult to predict. Changes to any of the above factors may have a material impact on our annual LIFO provision. The LIFO credit in fiscal 2024 in comparison to LIFO expense in the fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by lower brand pharmaceutical inflation largely due to manufacturer price decreases of wholesale acquisition costs of certain products. We recognized expenses in Cost of Goods Sold of $54.1 million and $87.0 million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the impact of Turkey highly inflationary accounting driven by the continued weakening of the Turkish Lira. Operating Expenses Fiscal Year Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Distribution, selling, and administrative $ 5,661,106 $ 5,309,984 6.6% Depreciation and amortization 1,091,974 963,904 13.3% Litigation and opioid-related expenses (credit), net 227,070 (24,693) Acquisition-related deal and integration expenses 103,001 139,683 Restructuring and other expenses 233,629 229,884 Goodwill impairment 418,000 Total operating expenses $ 7,734,780 $ 6,618,762 16.9% Distribution, selling, and administrative expenses increased by $351.1 million, or 6.6%, from the prior fiscal year. The increase from the prior fiscal year was primarily to support revenue growth. As a percentage of revenue, distribution, selling, and administrative expenses were 1.93% in the current fiscal year, which represented a decline of 10 basis points compared to the prior fiscal year as initiatives taken in fiscal 2023 improved operating efficiency across many of our businesses and administrative functions and the 12.1% revenue growth in the current fiscal year improved our operating leverage. Depreciation expense increased 4.4% from the prior fiscal year. Amortization expense increased 19.9% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to accelerated amortization expense, which we began recording in February 2023, in connection with 33 Table of Contents the shortened useful lives of certain trade names resulting from our company name change and gradual transition away from other tradenames used, which were acquired through prior acquisitions. Litigation and opioid-related expenses, net in fiscal 2024 included a $214.0 million litigation expense accrual for ongoing litigation related to the distribution of prescription opioid medications, a $49.1 million litigation expense accrual related to our animal health business (see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and $56.1 million of legal fees in connection with opioid lawsuits and investigations, offset in part by a net $92.2 million opioid litigation settlement accrual reduction primarily as a result of our prepayment of the net present value of a future obligation as permitted under our opioid settlement agreements. Litigation and opioid-related credit, net in fiscal 2023 included the receipt of $83.4 million from the H.D. Smith opioid litigation indemnity escrow and was offset in part by $58.7 million of legal fees in connection with opioid lawsuits and investigations. Acquisition-related deal and integration expenses in fiscal 2024 and 2023 primarily related to the continued integration of Alliance Healthcare and PharmaLex. Restructuring and other expenses are comprised of the following: Fiscal Year Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Restructuring and employee severance costs $ 69,968 $ 105,220 Business transformation efforts 130,069 82,117 Other, net 33,592 42,547 Total restructuring and other expenses $ 233,629 $ 229,884 Restructuring and employee severance costs in fiscal 2024 primarily included expenses incurred related to facility closures in connection with our office optimization plan and workforce reductions in both of our reportable segments. Restructuring and employee severance costs in fiscal 2023 primarily included expenses incurred in connection with workforce reductions in both of our reportable segments. Business transformation efforts in fiscal 2024 and 2023 included rebranding costs associated with our name change to Cencora and non-recurring expenses related to significant strategic initiatives to improve operational efficiency, including certain technology initiatives. The majority of these costs related to services provided by third-party consultants. In March 2024, we experienced a cybersecurity event where data from our information systems was exfiltrated. In connection with this event, we incurred costs that were recorded in Other, net in the above table. The majority of the costs included in Other, net in fiscal 2024 related to this cybersecurity event. In fiscal 2023, one of our foreign business units experienced a cybersecurity event that impacted a standalone legacy information technology platform in one country and the foreign business unit's ability to operate in that country for approximately two weeks. In connection with this event, we incurred costs to restore the foreign business unit's operations in that country, which were recorded in Other, net in the above table. The majority of the costs included in Other, net in fiscal 2023 related to this cybersecurity event. We recorded a $418.0 million goodwill impairment related to PharmaLex in fiscal 2024 (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). 34 Table of Contents Operating Income Fiscal Year Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change U.S. Healthcare Solutions $ 2,934,877 $ 2,596,559 13.0% International Healthcare Solutions 713,379 692,562 3.0% Total segment operating income 3,648,256 3,289,121 10.9% Gains from antitrust litigation settlements 170,904 239,092 LIFO credit (expense) 52,168 (204,595) Turkey highly inflationary impact (54,087) (86,967) Acquisition-related intangibles amortization (660,292) (551,046) Litigation and opioid-related (expenses) credit, net (227,070) 24,693 Acquisition-related deal and integration expenses (103,001) (139,683) Restructuring and other expenses (233,629) (229,884) Goodwill impairment (418,000) Operating income $ 2,175,249 $ 2,340,731 (7.1)% U.S. Healthcare Solutions operating income increased $338.3 million, or 13.0%, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in gross profit, as noted above, and was offset in part by the increase in operating expenses. As a percentage of revenue, U.S. Healthcare Solutions operating income margin was 1.11% and was flat compared to the prior fiscal year as the decline in gross profit margin, as described above in the Gross Profit section, was offset by the decline in operating expense margin, as described above in the Operating Expense section. International Healthcare Solutions' operating income increased by $20.8 million, or 3.0%, from the prior fiscal year. The increase in the current fiscal year was primarily due to our Canadian business, our global specialty logistics business, our less-than-wholly-owned Brazil full-line distribution business, and the January 2023 acquisition of PharmaLex, offset in part by foreign currency pressure and higher information technology operating expenses in our European distribution business. Other Loss (Income), Net We recognized gains of $40.7 million from the divestiture of non-core businesses in fiscal 2023. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net and the respective weighted average interest rates are as follows: Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (dollars in thousands) Amount Weighted Average Interest Rate Amount Weighted Average Interest Rate Interest expense $ 248,682 3.91% $ 275,650 3.59% Interest income (91,691) 5.41% (46,719) 4.60% Interest expense, net $ 156,991 $ 228,931 Interest expense, net decreased $71.9 million, or 31.4%, from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in interest income and the decrease in interest expense. The increase in interest income was driven by higher investment interest rates and higher average investment cash balances in the current fiscal year in comparison to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by a decrease in interest expense at our European distribution business primarily due to the September 2023 divestiture of our less-than-wholly-owned subsidiary in Egypt and decreased borrowings in Turkey. 35 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense Our effective tax rates were 24.2% and 19.8% in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2024 was higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to PharmaLex goodwill impairment, which is largely not deductible for income tax purposes, and U.S. state income taxes, offset in part by the discrete tax benefits associated with foreign valuation allowance adjustments, the benefit of non-U.S. income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, and tax benefits associated with equity compensation. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2023 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of non-U.S. income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, benefits from tax authority audit resolutions, and tax benefits associated with equity compensation, offset in part by U.S. state income taxes. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those policies that involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management's judgment. Actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent upon the application of estimates and assumptions. For a complete list of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowances for Returns and Credit Losses Trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for customer sales returns and an allowance for credit losses. Our customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit. We record an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer based upon historical customer return trends. The allowance for returns as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $1,175.9 million and $1,314.9 million, respectively. We evaluate our receivables for risk of loss by grouping our receivables with similar risk characteristics. Expected losses are determined based on a combination of historical loss trends, current economic conditions, and forward-looking risk factors. Changes in these factors, among others, may lead to adjustments in our allowance for credit losses. The calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by management as to the impact of those and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and maintain reserves for expected credit losses and specific credit problems when they arise. We write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote. We perform formal, documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and perform monthly credit loss reviews in connection with our largest businesses and our higher risk customer accounts. There were no significant changes to this process during fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods. The bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for credit losses, net of write-offs, recoveries, and other adjustments. Bad debt expense for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $40.8 million, $54.4 million, and $26.1 million respectively. An increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2024 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately $24.0 million. The allowance for credit losses was $132.1 million and $118.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Schedule II of this Form 10-K sets forth a rollforward of allowances for returns and credit losses. Business Combinations The assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the acquisition or consolidation of a business are recorded at estimated fair value, with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to (i) discount rates and expected future cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships, (ii) trade names, (iii) existing technology, and (iv) other intangible assets. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates. 36 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill arises from acquisitions or consolidations of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. We identify our reporting units based upon our management reporting structure, beginning with our operating segments. We aggregate two or more components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. We evaluate whether the components within our operating segments have similar economic characteristics, which include the similarity of long-term gross margins, the nature of the components' products, services, and production processes, the types of customers and the methods by which products or services are delivered to customers, and the components' regulatory environment. As of September 30, 2024, our reporting units include U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, U.S. Consulting Services, MWI Animal Health, Alliance Healthcare, Innomar, World Courier, PharmaLex, and Profarma. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as certain trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of these impairment tests, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. Such qualitative factors can include, among others, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, and relevant entity-specific events. If we conclude based on our qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative analysis. We elected to perform quantitative impairment assessments of goodwill for all our reporting units in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 with the exception of our PharmaLex reporting unit in fiscal 2023 since it was acquired in fiscal 2023. We elected to perform qualitative impairment assessments of indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 and a quantitative impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2022. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required, and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the difference between the carrying value and the fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, the amount of which may not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. When performing a quantitative impairment assessment, we utilize an income approach or a weighted average of an income and market approach to value our reporting units. The income approach relies on a discounted cash flow analysis, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate, to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. We generally believe that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of our reporting units in a sale transaction. The annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements, which are based upon our long-range plan. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both debt and equity, including a risk premium. While we use the best available information to prepare our forecasted cash flows and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows and/or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. While there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, our overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged. The quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (certain trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. We estimate the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method, which is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such indefinite-lived trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use. We completed our required annual impairment assessments relating to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 and recorded a $418.0 million goodwill impairment in our PharmaLex reporting unit in connection with our 2024 impairment assessment (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and a $75.9 million goodwill impairment in our Profarma reporting unit in connection with our fiscal 2022 impairment assessment. No goodwill impairments were recorded in fiscal 2023 and no indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments were recorded in fiscal 2024, 2023, or 2022. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We perform a recoverability assessment of our long-lived assets when impairment indicators are present. We performed a recoverability assessment of PharmaLex long-lived asset group as of July 1, 2024, and it was determined to be recoverable. 37 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect management's assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually. After application of the valuation allowances described above, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above. We prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based upon these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions' tax court systems. Significant judgment is exercised in applying complex tax laws and regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based upon the technical merits of the position. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances. However, others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued. The significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year. If any of our assumptions or estimates were to change, an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by $20.0 million in fiscal 2024. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for approximately 65% and 66% of our inventories as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 has been determined using the LIFO method. If we had used the first-in, first-out method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been approximately $1,535.8 million and $1,588.0 million higher than the amounts reported as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recorded a LIFO credit of $52.2 million in fiscal 2024 and LIFO expense of $204.6 million and $67.2 million in fiscal and 2023 and 2022, respectively. The annual LIFO provision is affected by manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, changes in inventory quantities, and product mix, many of which are difficult to predict. Changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to our annual LIFO provision. Cost for our inventory that is not determined using the LIFO method is stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method or moving average price method. Loss Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we become involved in lawsuits, administrative proceedings, government subpoenas, government investigations, stockholder demands, and other disputes, including antitrust, commercial, product liability, intellectual property, regulatory, employment discrimination, and other matters. Significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters, and some matters may require years to resolve. We record a liability when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency and whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can made in the notes to our financial statements. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. Among the loss contingencies we considered in accordance with the foregoing in connection with the preparation of the accompanying financial statements were the opioid matters described in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 38 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our operating results have generated cash flows, which, together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, have provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt, dividends, and purchases of shares of our common stock. Our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the repayment of debt, fund the payment of interest on debt, fund the payment of dividends, fund purchases of our common stock, finance acquisitions, and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including the opioid litigation payments that will be made over the next 14 years (see below). Cash Flows As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $851.3 million and $640.5 million, respectively. We have the ability to repatriate the majority of our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without incurring significant additional taxes upon repatriation. We have increased seasonal needs related to our inventory build during the December and March quarters that, depending on our cash balance, may require the use of our credit facilities to fund short-term capital needs. Our cash balances in fiscal 2024 and 2023 were supplemented by intra-period credit facility borrowings to cover short-term working capital needs. The largest amount of intra-period borrowings under our revolving and securitization credit facilities that was outstanding at any one time during fiscal 2024 and 2023 was $3.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. We had $69.7 billion, $77.9 billion, and $4.4 billion of cumulative intra-period borrowings that were repaid under our credit facilities during fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Our net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $426.6 million in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 largely due to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to our working capital accounts. More specifically, in fiscal 2024, the growth of our accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable balances provided $704.2 million of cash from operations compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2023. During fiscal 2024, our operating activities provided cash of $3.5 billion and was principally the result of the following: An increase in accounts payable of $5.0 billion primarily due to the increase in our inventory balances and the timing of scheduled payments to our suppliers; Positive non-cash items of $1.7 billion, which is primarily comprised of amortization expense of $670.6 million, depreciation expense of $448.2 million, and a $418.0 million goodwill impairment; Net income of $1.5 billion, offset in part by: An increase in accounts receivable of $2.8 billion primarily due to an increase in sales and the timing of scheduled payments from our customers; An increase in inventories of $1.5 billion to support the increase in business volume; and A decrease in long-term accrued litigation liability of $506.2 million due to opioid litigation settlement payments. During fiscal 2023, our operating activities provided cash of $3.9 billion and was principally the result of the following: An increase in accounts payable of $6.1 billion primarily due to the increase in our inventory balances and the timing of scheduled payments to our suppliers; Net income of $1.7 billion; Positive non-cash items of $1.3 billion, which is primarily comprised of amortization expense of $562.0 million, depreciation expense of $418.8 million, and LIFO expense of $204.6 million, offset in part by: An increase in accounts receivable of $2.7 billion primarily due to an increase in sales and the timing of scheduled payments from our customers; An increase in inventories of $2.2 billion to support the increase in business volume; and A decrease in long-term accrued litigation liability of $400.0 million due to opioid litigation settlement payments. 39 Table of Contents We use days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand, and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance. The below financial metrics are calculated based upon a quarterly average and can be impacted by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements, which can vary significantly depending upon the day of the week in which the month ends. Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2022 Days sales outstanding 28.7 27.7 27.7 Days inventory on hand 26.4 27.7 28.3 Days payable outstanding 60.3 60.0 60.0 Our cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based upon fluctuations in our period-end working capital account balances. Any changes to payment terms with a key customer or manufacturer supplier could have a material impact on our cash flows from operations. The addition of any new key customer or the loss of any existing key customer could have a material impact on our cash flows from operations. Operating cash flows during fiscal 2024 included $250.1 million of interest payments and $603.9 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. Operating cash flows during fiscal 2023 included $271.3 million of interest payments and $463.1 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. Operating cash flows during fiscal 2022 included $219.8 million of interest payments and $244.4 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $487.2 million, $458.4 million, and $496.3 million, respectively. Significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 included investments in various technology initiatives, including technology initiatives at Alliance Healthcare. We expect to spend approximately $600 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2025. Larger 2025 capital expenditures will include investments relating to the expansion and enhancement of our distribution network and various technology initiatives. In addition to capital expenditures, net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2023 included $1.4 billion for the acquisition of PharmaLex and $718.4 million for our investment in OneOncology (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition to capital expenditures, net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2022 included $133.8 million of cash to acquire companies, including $60.0 million that was paid to settle accrued consideration related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition, and was offset in part by $272.6 million in proceeds from the divestiture of non-core businesses. Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2024 included $1.5 billion in purchases of our common stock, the repayment of our $500 million of 3.400% senior notes that matured in May 2024, $416.2 million in cash dividends paid on our common stock, and a $350.0 million repayment on our Receivables Securitization Facility (as defined below), offset in part by the issuance of our $500 million of 5.125% senior notes in February 2024. Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2023 included $1.2 billion in purchases of our common stock, a $675 million repayment of our 0.737% senior notes that matured in March 2023, and $398.8 million in cash dividends paid on our common stock. Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 included an $850 million repayment of our 0.737% senior notes, $483.7 million in purchases of our common stock, $391.7 million in cash dividends paid on our common stock, and the repayment of our $250 million term loan. 40 Table of Contents Debt and Credit Facility Availability The following illustrates our debt structure as of September 30, 2024, including availability under the multi-currency revolving credit facility, the receivables securitization facility, the money market facility, and the Alliance Healthcare debt: (in thousands) Outstanding Balance Additional Availability Fixed-Rate Debt: $500,000, 3.250% senior notes due 2025 $ 499,738 $ $750,000, 3.450% senior notes due 2027 747,308 $500,000, 2.800% senior notes due 2030 496,564 $1,000,000, 2.700% senior notes due 2031 992,718 $500,000, 5.125% senior notes due 2034 494,514 $500,000, 4.250% senior notes due 2045 495,574 $500,000, 4.300% senior notes due 2047 493,821 Nonrecourse debt 70,191 Total fixed-rate debt 4,290,428 Variable-Rate Debt: Multi-currency revolving credit facility due 2029 2,400,000 Receivables securitization facility due 2027 1,450,000 Money market facility 100,000 Alliance Healthcare debt 286 477,910 Nonrecourse debt 97,362 Total variable-rate debt 97,648 4,427,910 Total debt $ 4,388,076 $ 4,427,910 In February 2024, we issued $500 million of 5.125% senior notes due in February 2034 (the "2034 Notes"). The 2034 Notes were sold at 99.867% of the principal amount with an effective yield of 5.132%. Interest on the 2034 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 beginning on August 15, 2024. We used the proceeds from the 2034 Notes to repay the $500 million of 3.400% senior notes that matured in May 2024. We have a $2.4 billion multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility ("Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility") with a syndicate of lenders, which was scheduled to expire in October 2028. In October 2024, we amended and restated the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility to extend the expiration to October 2029. Interest on borrowings under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility accrues at specified rates based upon our debt rating. We pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specified rates based upon our debt rating. We may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of subsidiaries and asset sales, with which we were compliant as of September 30, 2024. We have a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $2.4 billion at any one time. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time. The maturities on the notes will vary but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. The notes will bear interest, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. The commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. We have a $1,450 million receivables securitization facility ("Receivables Securitization Facility"), which was scheduled to expire in October 2026. In October 2024, we amended the Receivables Securitization Facility to extend the expiration to October 2027. We have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the Receivables Securitization Facility may be increased by up to $250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the December and March quarters. Interest rates are based upon prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper or 30-day Term SOFR plus a program fee. We pay a customary unused fee at prevailing market rates, monthly, to maintain the availability under the Receivables Securitization Facility. In connection with the Receivables Securitization Facility, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation and a specialty distribution subsidiary sell on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to Amerisource Receivables Financial Corporation, a wholly-owned special purpose entity, which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to financial 41 Table of Contents institutions and commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the Receivables Securitization Facility. As sold receivables are collected, additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility. We use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources. We securitize our trade accounts, which are generally non-interest bearing, in transactions that are accounted for as borrowings. The Receivables Securitization Facility contains similar covenants to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, with which we were compliant as of September 30, 2024. We had an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a revolving credit note that was terminated in April 2024. We also had a 10 million uncommitted U.K. overdraft facility, which expired in February 2024, to fund short-term normal trading cycle fluctuations related to our MWI animal health business. We have an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a money market credit agreement ("Money Market Facility"). The Money Market Facility provides us with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $100 million. The Money Market Facility may be decreased or terminated by the bank or us at any time without prior notice. Alliance Healthcare debt is comprised of uncommitted revolving credit facilities in various currencies with various rates. These facilities are used to fund its working capital needs. Nonrecourse debt is comprised of short-term and long-term debt belonging to the Brazil subsidiary and is repaid solely from the Brazil subsidiary' cash flows and such debt agreements provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts, and cash flows of the Brazil subsidiary. Share Purchase Programs and Dividends In May 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During fiscal 2022, we purchased $473.4 million of our common stock to complete our authorization under this program. In May 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During fiscal 2022, we purchased $38.7 million of common stock, which included $28.4 million of September 2022 purchases that cash settled in October 2022. During fiscal 2023, we purchased $961.3 million of our common stock, including $882.5 million from WBA, to complete our authorization under this program. In March 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During fiscal 2023, we purchased $191.0 million of our common stock, including $167.5 million from WBA. During fiscal 2024, we purchased $809.0 million of our common stock, including $522.6 million from WBA, to complete our authorization under this program. In March 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock, subject to market conditions. During fiscal 2024, we purchased $682.3 million of our common stock, including $427.4 million from WBA. As of September 30, 2024, we had $1,317.7 million of availability under this program. From October 1, 2024 through November 22, 2024, we purchased $385.4 million of our common stock. Our Board of Directors approved the following quarterly dividend increases: Dividend Increases Per Share Date New Rate Old Rate % Increase November 2021 $0.460 $0.440 5% November 2022 $0.485 $0.460 5% November 2023 $0.510 $0.485 5% November 2024 $0.550 $0.510 8% We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors. 42 Table of Contents Commitments and Obligations As discussed and defined in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on July 21, 2021, it was announced that we and the two other national pharmaceutical distributors had negotiated a Distributor Settlement Agreement. The Distributor Settlement Agreement became effective on April 2, 2022, and as of September 30, 2024, it included 48 of 49 eligible states (the "Settling States") as well as 99% by population of the eligible political subdivisions in the Settling States. Our accrued litigation liability related to the Distributor Settlement Agreement, including the State of Alabama and an estimate for non-participating government subsidiaries (with whom we have not reached a settlement agreement), as well as other opioid-related litigation for which we have reached settlement agreements on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024 is $4.9 billion and is expected to be paid over the next 14 years. We currently estimate that $630.2 million will be paid prior to September 30, 2025. The payment of the aforementioned litigation liability has not and is not expected to have an impact on our ability to pay dividends. The following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt, minimum rental payments on our noncancellable operating leases, and minimum payments on our other commitments as of September 30, 2024: Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Debt, Including Interest Payments Operating Leases Other Commitments Total Within 1 year $ 726,675 $ 248,556 $ 116,250 $ 1,091,481 1-3 years 344,184 437,502 166,544 948,230 4-5 years 1,009,527 333,414 48,550 1,391,491 After 5 years 3,905,571 460,097 1,069 4,366,737 Total $ 5,985,957 $ 1,479,569 $ 332,413 $ 7,797,939 The 2017 Tax Act requires a one-time transition tax to be recognized on historical foreign earnings and profits. As of September 30, 2024, we expect to pay a remaining $104.2 million, net of overpayments and tax credits, related to this transition tax over the next two years. The transition tax commitment is included in "Other Commitments" in the above table. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $545.0 million (including interest and penalties) as of September 30, 2024. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table. Our liability for uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024 primarily includes an uncertain tax benefit related to the legal accrual for litigation related to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications, as disclosed in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Market Risk We have exposure to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non-U.S. operations. Our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the U.K. Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Turkish Lira, the Brazilian Real, and the Canadian Dollar. We use forward contracts to hedge against the foreign currency exchange rate impact on certain intercompany receivable and payable balances. We may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure, but not for speculative or trading purposes. Revenue from our foreign operations during fiscal 2024 was approximately 10% of our consolidated revenue. We have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt. We manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. The amount of variable-rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements. We had $97.6 million of variable-rate debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024. We periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and/or on terms acceptable to us. There were no such financial instruments in effect as of September 30, 2024. We also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents. We had $3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024. The unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable-rate debt. For every $100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variable-rate debt, a 10-basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by $0.1 million. Deterioration of general economic conditions, among other factors, could adversely affect the number of prescriptions that are filled and the number of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, could reduce purchases by 43 Table of Contents our customers. In addition, volatility in financial markets and higher borrowing costs may also negatively impact our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms. Reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth, our profitability, and our cash flows from operations. Elevated levels of inflation in the global and U.S. economies have impacted certain operating expenses. If elevated levels of inflation persist or increase, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected, particularly in certain global markets. We have risks from other geopolitical trends and events, such as the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas. Although the long-term implications of these conflicts are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of these conflicts has not been material.
