BUSINESS OVERVIEW Our Business We are a financial holding company headquartered in Tallahassee, Florida, and we are the parent of our wholly owned subsidiary, Capital City Bank (the Bank or CCB ). We offer a broad array of products and services, including commercial and retail banking services, trust and asset management, and retail securities brokerage through a total of 57 banking offices located in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. Please see the section captioned About Us beginning on page 4 for more detailed information about our business. Our profitability, like most financial institutions, is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income, which is the difference between the interest and fees received on interest earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses, operating expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and other operating expenses including income taxes, and noninterest income such as deposit fees, wealth management fees, mortgage banking fees, and bank card fees. Strategic Review Our philosophy is to build long-term client relationships based on quality service, high ethical standards, and safe and sound banking practices. We maintain a locally oriented, community-based focus, which is augmented by experienced, centralized support in select specialized areas. Our local market orientation is reflected in our network of banking office locations, experienced community executives with a dedicated President for each market, and community boards which support our focus on responding to local banking needs. We strive to offer a broad array of sophisticated products and to provide quality service by empowering associates to make decisions in their local markets. 35 We have sought to build our franchise in small-to medium-sized, less competitive markets, located on the outskirts of the larger metropolitan markets where we are positioned as a market leader. Many of our markets are on the outskirts of these larger markets in close proximity to major interstate thoroughfares such as Interstates I-10 and I-75. Our three largest markets are Tallahassee (Leon County, Florida), Gainesville (Alachua County, Florida), and Macon (Bibb County, Georgia). In 12 of 18 markets in Florida and two of four markets in Georgia, we frequently rank within the top four banks in terms of deposit market share. Furthermore, in the counties in which we operate, we maintain an 8.26% deposit market share in the Florida counties and 5.09% in the Georgia counties, suggesting that there is significant opportunity to grow market share within these geographic areas. The larger employers in many of our markets are state and local governments, healthcare providers, educational institutions, and small businesses. While we realize that the markets in our footprint do not provide for potential growth that the larger metropolitan markets may offer, we believe our markets do provide good growth dynamics and have historically grown in excess of the national average. The value of these markets stems from the fact they are generally stable and less competitive, secondary markets. We strive to provide value added services to our clients by being not just their bank, but their banker. We believe this element of our strategy distinguishes Capital City Bank from our competitors. Our long-term vision remains to profitably expand our franchise through a combination of organic growth in existing markets and acquisitions. We have long understood that our core deposit funding base is a predominant driver of our profitability and overall franchise value, and have focused extensively on this component of our organic growth efforts in recent years. As the community banking sector continues to transform, we are focused on retaining strategies that operate effectively and are profitable while evaluating and executing strategies necessary to adapt to a changing operating environment, technology, and client behavior. While we have not been an active acquirer of banks since 2005, this component of our strategy is still in place. When evaluating potential acquisition opportunities, we will continue to weigh the value of organic growth initiatives versus potential acquisition returns and pursue the strategies that we believe provide the best overall return to our shareowners. The focus of potential acquisition opportunities will be in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama with a particular focus on financial institutions located on the outskirts of larger, metropolitan areas, including Alachua, Marion, Hernando/Pasco counties in Florida, the western panhandle of Florida, and Bibb and surrounding counties in central Georgia. Our focus on some of these markets may change as we continue to evaluate our strategy and the economic conditions and demographics of any individual market. We will also continue to evaluate de novo expansion opportunities in attractive new markets where acquisition opportunities are not feasible. We may also evaluate expansion opportunities including asset management, mortgage banking, and other financial businesses that are closely aligned with the business of banking. Embedded in our acquisition strategy is our desire to partner with institutions that are culturally similar, have experienced management and possess either established market presence or have potential for improved profitability through growth, economies of scale, or expanded services. Generally, these potential target institutions will range in asset size from $100 million to $500 million. On March 1, 2020, we acquired a 51 % equity interest in Brand Mortgage, LLC, headquartered in Lawrenceville, Georgia. The company is an innovative provider of mortgage banking services doing business in 10 states around the Southeast. We expect that this strategic alliance will offer the advantage of expanded service areas, a wider array of products and options to meet the needs of homebuyers in all stages of life, and increased lending capacity through additional processing hubs and investors. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW For 2019, net income totaled $30.8 million, or $1.83 per diluted share, compared to net income of $26.2 million, or $1.54 per diluted share for 2018. Net income for 2018 included tax benefits totaling $3.3 million, or $0.19 per diluted share related to 2017 plan year pension contributions made in 2018. The increase in net income of $4.6 million for 2019 versus 2018 was attributable to higher net interest income of $10.8 million, higher noninterest income of $1.5 million, and a $0.9 million decrease in the loan loss provision, partially offset by higher income taxes of $6.5 million and noninterest expense of $2.1 million. Below are summary highlights that impacted our performance for the year: Strong revenue growth - Net interest income increased 12% - Noninterest income increased 3% Net interest margin of 3.85%, increased 21 basis points Average loans increased $104 million, or 6% Average deposit balances increased $115 million, or 5% Continued strong credit quality - Loan loss provision decreased $0.9 million, or 31% - Nonperforming assets decreased $3.7 million, or 40% Tangible common equity ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased 48 basis points to 8.06% 36 Tangible book value per share, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased 10.9% to $14.37 In 2019, despite pressure from the three Federal Open Market Committee rate reductions in the second half of the year, our net interest income and net interest margin grew $10.8 million and 21 basis points, respectively, as the impact of higher rates prior to 2019 continued to migrate through the earning asset portfolios. Further, loan growth and higher overnight funds income driven by strong deposit growth contributed to the improvement. Average loans grew 6% and we realized growth in all categories except home equity and consumer loans. Economic and business conditions in our markets remained stable and drove loan demand in 2019 despite some slowing in the second half of the year. 2019 continued our sixth consecutive year of deposit growth which has averaged 3.5% per year. Noninterest income had a break-out year driven by wealth management and mortgage banking. Additionally, initiatives aimed at growing our deposit and bank card fees contributed in 2019. These improvements reflected the ongoing commitment we have made to growing and diversifying our fee based revenues. While our noninterest expenses grew in 2019, a majority of the increase was related to revenue generating activities (commissions for mortgage originations and retail brokerage fees) and annual merit raises. Other operating expenses were well controlled in 2019 and reflected our ongoing commitment to expense management as a component of improving our efficiency ratio. Asset quality continued to improve and our loan losses remained low in 2019 allowing for a lower loan loss provision. We continue to operate within our historical risk profile and will not unnecessarily compromise on rate, structure, or quality. Key components of our 2019 financial performance are summarized below: Results of Operations For 2019, tax-equivalent net interest income totaled $103.9 million, a $10.7 million, or 11.5%, increase over 2018 driven by deposit growth (predominately noninterest bearing), which funded growth in overnight funds and loans. Average yields/rates were generally favorable as higher rates prior to 2019 continued to migrate through the earning asset portfolios. For 2019, our loan loss provision was $2.0 million for 2019 compared to $2.9 million for 2018 with the decrease attributable to further improvement in overall credit quality. For 2019, noninterest income totaled $53.1 million, a $1.5 million, or 2.9%, increase over 2018, which reflected higher wealth management fees of $1.8 million, mortgage banking fees of $0.6 million, and bank card fees of $0.6 million, partially offset by lower deposit fees of $0.6 million and other income of $0.9 million. For 2019, noninterest expense totaled $113.6 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 1.9%, over 2018 attributable to higher compensation expense of $2.4 million that was partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in other expense. Financial Condition Average assets totaled approximately $2.987 billion for 2019, an increase of $129.9 million, or 4.6%, over 2018. Average earning assets were approximately $2.697 billion for 2019, an increase of $135.2 million, or 5.3% over 2018. Year-over-year, average overnight funds increased $102.6 million, while investment securities decreased $71.1 million and average loans were higher by $103.7 million. Average loans totaled $1.822 billion in 2019, an increase of $103.7 million, or 6.0%, over 2018. Loans as a percentage of average earning assets increased to 67.6% in 2019 compared to 67.1% in 2018. We realized growth in all loan categories except home equity loans and consumer loans. A portion of the increase in 2019 was due to the purchase of adjustable rate residential loans ($14.9 million at time of purchase) and fixed rate commercial loans ($10.3 million at time of purchase). Average total deposits for 2019 were $2.537 billion, an increase of $114.5 million, or 4.7%, over 2018. Most of the increase occurred in noninterest bearing deposit balances which increased $105 million, or 11.6%. At December 31, 2019, nonperforming assets (nonaccrual loans and OREO) totaled $5.4 million. a $3.7 million, or 40.4%, decrease from December 31, 2018. Nonaccrual loans totaled $4.5 million at December 31, 2019, a $2.4 million decrease from December 31, 2018. The balance of OREO totaled $1.0 million at December 31, 2019, a $1.3 million decrease from December 31, 2018. Nonperforming assets represented 0.18% of total assets at December 31, 2019 compared to 0.31% at December 31, 2018. 37 At December 31, 2019, our allowance for loan losses of $13.9 million represented 0.75% of outstanding loans (net of overdrafts) and provided coverage of 311% of nonperforming loans compared to 0.80% and 207%, respectively, at December 31, 2018. For 2019, our net loan charge-offs totaled $2.3 million, or 0.13%, of average loans, compared to $2.0 million, or 0.12%, for 2018. Shareowners equity increased by $24.1 million to $327.0 million at December 31, 2019. We continue to maintain a strong capital base as evidenced by a risk-based capital ratio of 17.90% and tangible common equity ratio of 8.06% at December 31, 2019 compared to 17.13% and 7.58%, respectively, at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, all of our regulatory capital ratios significantly exceeded the threshold to be well-capitalized. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For 2019, we realized net income of $30.8 million, or $1.83 per diluted share, compared to $26.2 million, or $1.54 per diluted share for 2018 and $10.9 million, or $0.64 per diluted share for 2017. The increase in net income for 2019 was attributable to higher net interest income of $10.8 million, higher noninterest income of $1.5 million, and a $0.9 million decrease in the loan loss provision, partially offset by higher income taxes of $6.5 million and noninterest expense of $2.1 million. The increase in net income for 2018 was attributable to a $9.5 million increase in net interest income and an $8.8 million reduction in income tax expense, partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in noninterest expense, a $0.7 million increase in the loan loss provision, and lower noninterest income of $0.2 million. Income tax expense for 2018 reflected the favorable impact of the Tax Act, including a lower federal corporate tax rate and one-time discrete tax benefits totaling $3.3 million, or $0.19 per diluted share related to 2017 plan year pension contributions made during 2018. A condensed earnings summary for the last three years is presented in Table 1 below: Table 1 CONDENSED SUMMARY OF EARNINGS (Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Data) 2019 2018 2017 Interest Income $ 112,836 $ 99,395 $ 86,930 Taxable Equivalent Adjustments 526 654 1,226 Total Interest Income (FTE) 113,362 100,049 88,156 Interest Expense 9,493 6,891 3,948 Net Interest Income (FTE) 103,869 93,158 84,208 Provision for Loan Losses 2,027 2,921 2,215 Taxable Equivalent Adjustments 526 654 1,226 Net Interest Income After Provision for Loan Losses 101,316 89,583 80,767 Noninterest Income 53,053 51,565 51,746 Noninterest Expense 113,609 111,503 109,447 Income Before Income Taxes 40,760 29,645 23,066 Income Tax Expense 9,953 3,421 12,203 Net Income $ 30,807 $ 26,224 $ 10,863 Basic Net Income Per Share $ 1.84 $ 1.54 $ 0.64 Diluted Net Income Per Share $ 1.83 $ 1.54 $ 0.64 Net Interest Income Net interest income represents our single largest source of earnings and is equal to interest income and fees generated by earning assets, less interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities. We provide an analysis of our net interest income, including average yields and rates in Tables 2 and 3 below. We provide this information on a "taxable equivalent" basis to reflect the tax-exempt status of income earned on certain loans and investments. 38 In 2019, our taxable equivalent net interest income increased $10.7 million, or 11.5%. This follows increases of $9.0 million, or 10.6%, and $5.2 million, or 6.6%, in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in 2019 was driven by deposit growth (predominately noninterest bearing), which funded growth in overnight funds and loans. Additionally, average yields/rates were generally favorable as higher rates prior to 2019 continued to migrate through the earning asset portfolios. The increase in 2018 was attributable to growth in our loan and investment portfolios, and favorable repricing of our adjustable and variable rate earning assets, partially offset by an increase in our negotiated rate products. For 2019, taxable equivalent interest income increased $13.3 million, or 13.3%, over 2018. For 2018, taxable equivalent interest income increased $11.9 million, or 13.5%, over 2017. The increase for both years was primarily due to higher loan balances coupled with higher interest rates. For 2019, interest expense increased $2.6 million, or 37.8%, over 2018. For 2018, interest expense increased $2.9 million, or 74.5%, over 2017. The increase for both years primarily reflected increases to our negotiated rate deposits which are tied to an adjustable rate index. Our cost of funds increased eight basis points to 35 basis points in 2019 and increased 11 basis points to 27 basis points in 2018. The increase for both years was primarily due to higher interest rates paid on our negotiated rate products due to the average increase in interest rates over the three year period. Our interest rate spread (defined as the taxable-equivalent yield on average earning assets less the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities) increased 15 basis points in 2019 and increased 19 basis points in 2018. Our net interest margin (defined as taxable-equivalent interest income less interest expense divided by average earning assets) of 3.85% in 2019 was a 21 basis point increase over 2018. The net interest margin of 3.64% in 2018 was a 27 basis point increase over 2017. The increase in the interest rate spread and net interest margin for both years was attributable to rising rates and an improving mix of earning assets driven by loan growth. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decreased the federal funds target rate three times in 2019 to end the year with a target rate in the range of 1.50%-1.75%, which followed four rate increases in 2018. These rate increases positively affected our net interest income in 2018 and the first half of 2019 due to favorable repricing of our variable and adjustable rate earning assets. As the overnight funds rate fell in the second half of 2019, these variable and adjustable rate earning assets have begun to price lower. As we continue to closely monitor and manage our overall cost of funds, we review and implement various loan strategies that align with our overall risk appetite to enhance our performance on an ongoing basis. We continue to maintain short duration portfolios on both sides of the balance sheet and believe we are well positioned to respond to changing market conditions. 39 Table 2 AVERAGE BALANCES AND INTEREST RATES 2019 2018 2017 (Taxable Equivalent Basis - Dollars in Thousands) Average Balance Interest Average Rate Average Balance Interest Average Rate Average Balance Interest Average Rate ASSETS Loans, Net of Unearned Income (1)(2) $ 1,822,087 $ 94,662 5.20 % $ 1,718,348 $ 84,550 4.92 % $ 1,618,583 $ 76,385 4.72 % Taxable Investment Securities 612,541 13,123 2.14 641,120 12,083 1.88 595,790 8,095 1.36 Tax-Exempt Investment Securities (2) 24,471 390 1.60 67,037 1,006 1.50 97,867 1,610 1.65 Funds Sold 237,999 5,187 2.18 135,379 2,410 1.78 189,991 2,066 1.09 Total Earning Assets 2,697,098 113,362 4.20 % 2,561,884 100,049 3.91 % 2,502,231 88,156 3.52 % Cash & Due From Banks 52,453 51,222 51,091 Allowance for Loan Losses (14,622) (13,993) (13,541) Other Assets 252,127 258,035 276,315 TOTAL ASSETS $ 2,987,056 $ 2,857,148 $ 2,816,096 LIABILITIES NOW Accounts $ 805,134 $ 5,502 0.68 % $ 781,026 $ 3,152 0.40 % $ 805,861 $ 1,094 0.14 % Money Market Accounts 235,845 946 0.40 251,175 675 0.27 258,304 252 0.10 Savings Accounts 370,430 182 0.05 351,341 172 0.05 323,928 159 0.05 Time Deposits 113,499 210 0.19 131,860 244 0.18 151,301 284 0.19 Total Interest Bearing Deposits 1,524,908 6,840 0.45 % 1,515,402 4,243 0.29 % 1,539,394 1,789 0.12 % Short-Term Borrowings 9,275 109 1.19 10,992 110 0.99 9,927 82 0.82 Subordinated Notes Payable 52,887 2,287 4.26 52,887 2,167 4.04 52,887 1,634 3.05 Other Long-Term Borrowings 7,393 257 3.48 12,387 371 3.00 15,174 443 2.92 Total Interest Bearing Liabilities 1,594,463 9,493 0.60 % 1,591,668 6,891 0.45 % 1,617,382 3,948 0.25 % Noninterest Bearing Deposits 1,012,581 907,571 832,477 Other Liabilities 62,940 63,045 82,833 TOTAL LIABILITIES 2,669,984 2,562,284 2,532,692 SHAREOWNERS EQUITY TOTAL SHAREOWNERS EQUITY 317,072 294,864 283,404 TOTAL LIABILITIES & EQUITY $ 2,987,056 $ 2,857,148 $ 2,816,096 Interest Rate Spread 3.61 % 3.46 % 3.27 % Net Interest Income $ 103,869 $ 93,158 $ 84,208 Net Interest Margin (3) 3.85 % 3.64 % 3.37 % (1) Average balances include nonaccrual loans.

Changes which are not solely due to volume changes or solely due to rate changes have been attributed to rate changes. (2) Interest income includes the effects of taxable equivalent adjustments using a 21% tax rate to adjust interest for 2019 and 2018 and a 35% tax rate for 2017 to adjust interest on tax-exempt loans and securities to a taxable equivalent basis. Provision for Loan Losses Our provision for loan loss was $2.0 million for 2019 compared to $2.9 million for 2018 and $2.2 million in 2017. The decrease in 2019 was primarily due to improvement in overall credit quality. The increase in 2018 was driven by growth of our loan portfolio. We discuss these trends in further detail below under Risk Element Assets and Allowance for Loan Losses. Noninterest Income For 2019, noninterest income totaled $53.1 million, a $1.5 million, or 2.9%, increase over 2018, which reflected higher wealth management fees of $1.8 million, mortgage banking fees of $0.6 million, and bank card fees of $0.6 million, partially offset by lower deposit fees of $0.6 million and other income of $0.9 million. The improvement in wealth management fees was driven by higher trading activity by our retail brokerage clients and to a lesser extent growth in assets under management. A lower rate environment drove higher residential loan production and the increase in mortgage banking fees. Higher debit card utilization by our clients and credit card promotions throughout the year drove the improvement in bank card fees. The decline in deposit fees reflected lower overdraft fees and the reduction in other income was primarily attributable to a miscellaneous recovery in 2018 and lower miscellaneous loan fees. For 2018, noninterest income totaled $51.6 million, a $0.2 million, or 0.3%, decrease from 2017, and reflected lower mortgage banking fees of $1.0 million, partially offset by higher other income of $0.4 million and wealth management fees of $0.4 million. The lower level of mortgage banking fees was due to a reduction in the volume of loans sold in secondary market as adjustable rate loan production picked up momentum and is being retained in our loan portfolio instead of sold on the secondary market. Total residential loan production (secondary market sales and portfolio) during 2018 was comparable to 2017. The increase in other income reflected higher signing bonus income from processing contracts and miscellaneous income. The increase in wealth management fees was attributable to higher trust fees and reflected growth in assets under management. 41 Noninterest income as a percent of total operating revenues (net interest income plus noninterest income) was 33.92% in 2019, 35.79% in 2018, and 38.41% in 2017. The decline in this metric over the last three years was attributable to growth in net interest income as a component of operating revenues.

For 2019, deposit fees (service charge fees, insufficient fund/overdraft fees ( NSF/OD ), and business account analysis fees) totaled $19.5 million compared to $20.1 million in 2018 and $20.3 million in 2017. The $0.6 million, or 3.1%, decrease in 2019 reflected lower NSF/OD fees and higher overdraft losses that were partially offset by higher service charge fees. The $0.2 million, or 1.2%, decrease in 2018 reflected lower NSF/OD fees that were significantly offset by higher service charge fees. In mid-2018, we introduced a new fee-based checking account line-up which has enhanced our service charge fees and helped to buffer the overall decline in our total deposit fee revenues. Bank Card Fees . Bank card fees totaled $12.0 million in 2019 compared to $11.4 million in 2018 and $11.2 million in 2017. We continue to focus on initiatives aimed at growing our bank card fee revenues, including the aforementioned new checking account line-up, an account acquisition initiative that began in early 2019, and periodic debit and credit card promotions. Wealth Management Fees . Wealth management fees including both trust fees (i.e., managed accounts and trusts/estates) and retail brokerage fees (i.e., investment, insurance products, and retirement accounts) totaled $10.5 million in 2019 compared to $8.7 million in 2018 and $8.3 million in 2017. The growth in fees for 2019 reflected a $1.3 million increase in retail brokerage fees and $0.5 million increase in trust fees. Higher transactions volumes and new investment advisors hired in late 2018 and in 2019 drove the increase in retail brokerage fees in 2019. Growth in assets under management contributed to the growth in fees for all periods. At December 31, 2019, total assets under management were approximately $1.774 billion compared to $1.500 billion at December 31, 2018 and $1.418 billion at December 31, 2017. Mortgage Banking Fees . Mortgage banking fees totaled $5.3 million in 2019 compared to $4.7 million in 2018 and $5.8 million in 2017. The increase in 2019 was attributable to higher production sold into the secondary market driven by the lower interest rate environment. The decrease in 2018 was attributable to a reduction in the volume of loans sold in secondary market as adjustable rate loan production picked up momentum and was retained in our loan portfolio. Refinancing activity represented 14% of our loan production in 2019 and 11% in 2018 and 2017. Market conditions, housing activity, the level of interest rates and the mix of our fixed-rate and adjustable rate production have significant impacts on our mortgage banking fees. Other . Other noninterest income totaled $5.8 million in 2019 compared to $6.6 million in 2018 and $6.2 million in 2017. The $0.9 million, or 13.0%, decrease in 2019 was primarily due to a miscellaneous recovery in 2018 and lower miscellaneous loan fees. The $0.4 million, or 7.5%, increase in 2018 reflected higher signing bonus income from renegotiated processing contracts and miscellaneous income. Noninterest Expense For 2019, noninterest expense totaled $113.6 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 1.9%, over 2018 attributable to higher compensation expense of $2.4 million that was partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in other expense. The increase in compensation expense was attributable to salary expense (primarily merit raises) and commission expense (related to residential mortgage originations and retail brokerage transactions). The decrease in other expense was primarily due to lower professional fees and insurance-other expense (primarily FDIC premiums) that was partially offset by higher expense for other real estate ( OREO ) properties. The increase in OREO was due to lower net gains from property sales in 2019. 42 For 2018, noninterest expense totaled $111.5 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 1.9%, over 2017 attributable to higher compensation expense of $1.6 million and occupancy expense of $0.7 million, partially offset by lower other expense of $0.2 million. Higher salary expense, primarily cash incentives, drove the increase in compensation expense. Occupancy expense increased due to higher equipment/software maintenance agreement expense and to a lesser extent an increase in building maintenance costs (partly related to Hurricane Michael). The decrease in other expense was primarily attributable to lower OREO expense of $1.6 million, partially offset by higher professional fees of $1.3 million. Higher net gains from property sales drove the improvement in OREO expense. The increase in professional fees reflected costs associated with several consulting projects, including both profit enhancements projects and the upgrading of ancillary systems, all of which were complete at the end of the third quarter of 2018. Our operating efficiency ratio (expressed as noninterest expense as a percent of taxable equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income) was 72.40%, 77.05% and 80.50% in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Improved operating leverage primarily attributable to growth in net interest income is the primary driver of improvement for all respective years. Higher noninterest income also contributed to the improvement in 2019. Expense management is an important part of our culture and strategic focus. We will continue to review and evaluate opportunities to optimize our operations, reduce operating costs and manage our discretionary expenses. The table below reflects the major components of noninterest expense. (Dollars in Thousands) 2019 2018 2017 Salaries $ 50,688 $ 48,087 $ 46,421 Associate Benefits 15,664 15,834 15,892 Total Compensation 66,352 63,921 62,313 Premises 8,734 8,913 8,790 Equipment 9,702 9,590 9,047 Total Occupancy 18,436 18,503 17,837 Legal Fees 1,722 2,055 1,933 Professional Fees 4,345 5,003 3,689 Processing Services 5,779 5,978 6,253 Advertising 2,056 1,611 1,731 Travel and Entertainment 1,045 974 868 Telephone 2,645 2,224 2,405 Insurance Other 1,007 1,625 1,626 Other Real Estate, Net 546 (442) 1,135 Miscellaneous 9,676 10,051 9,657 Total Other Expense 28,821 29,079 29,297 Total Noninterest Expense $ 113,609 $ 111,503 $ 109,447 Various significant components of noninterest expense are discussed in more detail below. Compensation . Compensation expense totaled $66.4 million in 2019, $63.9 million in 2018, and $62.3 million in 2017. For 2019, the $2.4 million, or 3.8%, increase over 2018 was attributable to higher salary expense of $2.6 million, partially offset by lower associate benefit expense of $0.2 million. Higher base salary expense and commission expense drove the increase. The increase in base salaries primarily reflected merit raises and the increase in commissions was related to the residential mortgage and retail securities brokerage businesses. For 2018, the $1.6 million, or 2.6%, increase over 2017 reflected higher salary expense of $1.7 million, partially offset by lower associate benefit expense of $0.1 million. A higher level of cash incentives which reflected improved financial performance drove a significant portion of the increase in salary expense. Slightly higher base salaries and contractual employment also contributed to the increase, but to a lesser extent. 43 Occupancy . Occupancy expense (including premises and equipment) totaled $18.4 million for 2019, $18.5 million for 2018, and $17.8 million for 2017. For 2019, the $0.1 million, or 0.4%, decrease from 2018 generally reflected the closing of two offices in 2019. For 2018, the $0.7 million, or 3.7%, increase over 2017 was attributable to higher equipment/software maintenance agreement expense and to a lesser extent an increase in building maintenance costs (partly related to Hurricane Michael). Other . Other noninterest expense totaled $28.8 million in 2019, $29.1 million in 2018, and $29.3 million in 2017. For 2019, the $0.3 million, or 0.9%, decrease was primarily attributable to lower professional fees of $0.7 million and insurance-other expense of $0.6 million, partially offset by higher OREO expense of $1.0 million. The reduction in professional fees reflected the completion of several consulting projects in the second half of 2018. Lower FDIC insurance premiums drove the reduction in insurance-other expense as we used a bulk of our premium credits in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. The increase in OREO expense was due to a lower level of net gains from the sale of properties in 2019. For 2018, the $0.2 million, or 0.7%, decrease was primarily attributable to lower OREO expense of $1.6 million, partially offset by higher professional fees of $1.3 million. A higher level of net gains (higher gains of $1.2 million and lower losses of $0.2 million) from the sale of properties drove the reduction in OREO expense. During 2018, we sold a banking office in our Tallahassee market which resulted in a $2.0 million gain. The increase in professional fees reflected costs associated with several consulting projects, including both profit enhancements projects and the upgrading of ancillary systems, all of which were essentially complete at the end of the third quarter of 2018. Income Taxes For 2019, we realized income tax expense of $9.9 million (effective rate of 24%) compared to $3.4 million (effective rate of 12%) for 2018 and $12.2 million (effective rate of 53%) for 2017. In September 2019, Florida enacted a corporate tax rate reduction from 5.5% to 4.5% retroactive to January 1, 2019. As a result, our deferred tax accounts were re-measured resulting in a discrete tax expense of $0.4 million. Further, our 2019 state tax rate was adjusted to reflect the one percentage point reduction which will be in effect through the end of 2021 at which time it will revert back to 5.5%. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. Among other things, the Tax Act reduced our corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result, we were required to re-measure, through income tax expense, our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted rate at which we expect them to be recovered or settled. We recorded an adjustment in the amount of $4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the re-measurement of our deferred tax inventory. Income tax expense for 2017 also included a $0.3 million write-off of a deferred tax asset related to a cancelled stock award as well as income tax benefits of $0.2 million related to stock-based compensation awards. During 2018, income tax expense included four discrete tax benefit items totaling $3.6 million resulting from the effect of the Tax Act. Three discrete items totaling $3.3 million related to pension plan contributions made in 2018 for the plan year 2017. In addition, we realized a discrete tax item for $0.3 million related to a tax accounting method change for a cost segregation and depreciation analysis for various properties we own which was filed with the extended 2017 tax return. Excluding discrete items, our effective tax rate was 23% for 2019, 24% for 2018 and 36% for 2017. FINANCIAL CONDITION Average assets totaled approximately $2.987 billion for 2019, an increase of $129.9 million, or 4.6%, over 2018. Average earning assets were approximately $2.697 billion for 2019, an increase of $135.2 million, or 5.3% over 2018. Compared to 2018, average overnight funds increased $102.6 million, while investment securities decreased $71.1 million and average loans were higher by $103.7 million. We discuss these variances in more detail below. Table 2 provides information on average balances and rates, Table 3 provides an analysis of rate and volume variances and Table 4 highlights the changing mix of our interest earning assets over the last three years. Loans In 2019, average loans increased $103.7 million, or 6.0%, compared to an increase of $99.8 million, or 6.2%, in 2018. Loans as a percentage of average earning assets increased to 67.6% in 2019 compared to 67.1% in 2018 and 64.7% in 2017. Compared to 2018, we realized average growth in all loan categories except home equity loans and consumer loans. Over the course of 2019, we purchased both adjustable rate residential loans and fixed rate commercial loans totaling $25.2 million based on principal balances at the time of purchase. We continue to make minor modifications on some of our lending programs to try and mitigate the impact that consumer and business deleveraging has had on our portfolio. These programs, coupled with economic improvements in our anchor markets and loan purchases, have helped to increase overall loan growth. 44 We originate mortgage loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties through our Residential Real Estate line of business, a majority of which are fixed-rate loans that are sold into the secondary market to third party purchasers on a best efforts delivery basis with servicing released. A majority of our adjustable rate loans are retained in our loan portfolio.

The higher loan-to-deposit ratio reflected stronger growth in our average loan balances relative to the growth in average deposit balances. The composition of our loan portfolio at December 31 st for each of the past five years is shown in Table 5. Table 6 arrays our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019, by maturity period. As a percentage of the total portfolio, loans with fixed interest rates represented 38.2% at December 31, 2019 compared to 38.6% at December 31, 2018. Although balances in our fixed rate products increased $16.9 million, stronger growth was experienced in our floating or adjustable rate products relative to the percent of the overall loan portfolio, reducing this ratio.

Risk Element Assets Risk element assets consist of nonaccrual loans, OREO, troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ), past due loans, potential problem loans, and loan concentrations. Table 7 depicts certain categories of our risk element assets as of December 31 st for each of the last five years. Activity within our nonperforming asset portfolio is provided below in Table 8. Nonperforming assets (nonaccrual loans and OREO) totaled $5.4 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $9.1 million at December 31, 2018. Nonaccrual loans totaled $4.5 million at December 31, 2019, a $2.4 million decrease from December 31, 2018. Nonaccrual loan additions totaled $9.2 million for 2019 compared to $12.2 million for 2018. The balance of OREO totaled $1.0 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1.3 million from December 31, 2018. For 2019, we disposed of properties totaling $2.3 million compared to $2.8 million in 2018. Nonperforming assets represented 0.18% of total assets at December 31, 2019 compared to 0.31% at December 31, 2018. 46 Table 7 RISK ELEMENT ASSETS (Dollars in Thousands) 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 Nonaccruing Loans: Commercial, Financial and Agricultural $ 446 $ 267 $ 629 $ 468 $ 96 Real Estate Construction - 722 298 311 97 Real Estate Commercial Mortgage 1,434 2,860 2,370 3,410 4,191 Real Estate Residential 1,392 2,119 1,938 2,330 4,739 Real Estate Home Equity 797 584 1,748 1,774 1,017 Consumer 403 320 176 240 165 Total Nonaccruing Loans ( NALs ) (1) $ 4,472 $ 6,872 $ 7,159 $ 8,533 $ 10,305 Other Real Estate Owned 953 2,229 3,941 10,638 19,290 Total Nonperforming Assets ( NPAs ) $ 5,425 $ 9,101 $ 11,100 $ 19,171 $ 29,595 Past Due Loans 30 89 Days $ 4,871 $ 4,757 $ 4,543 $ 6,438 $ 5,775 Past Due Loans 90 Days or More (accruing) - - 36 - - Performing Troubled Debt Restructurings $ 16,888 $ 22,084 $ 32,164 $ 38,233 $ 35,634 Nonaccruing Loans/Loans 0.24 % 0.39 % 0.43 % 0.54 % 0.69 % Nonperforming Assets/Total Assets 0.18 0.31 0.38 0.67 1.06 Nonperforming Assets/Loans Plus OREO 0.29 0.51 0.67 1.21 1.94 Allowance/Nonaccruing Loans 310.99 % 206.79 % 185.87 % 157.40 % 135.40 % (1) Nonaccruing TDRs totaling $0.7 million, $2.6 million, and $2.3 million are included in NALs at December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

Nonaccrual loans totaled $4.5 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $2.4 million from December 31, 2018. Gross additions to nonaccrual status during 2019 totaled $9.2 million compared to $12.2 million in 2018. Generally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due or management deems the collectability of the principal and interest to be doubtful. Once a loan is placed in nonaccrual status, all previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized when the ultimate collectability is no longer considered doubtful. Loans are returned to accrual status when the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current or when future payments are reasonably assured. If interest on our loans classified as nonaccrual during 2019 had been recognized on a fully accruing basis, we would have recorded an additional $0.4 million of interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other Real Estate Owned . OREO represents property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans or by receiving a deed in lieu of foreclosure. OREO is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure. Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses. On an ongoing basis, properties are either revalued internally or by a third party appraiser as required by applicable regulations. Subsequent declines in value are reflected as other noninterest expense. Carrying costs related to maintaining the OREO properties are expensed as incurred and are also reflected as other noninterest expense. OREO totaled $1.0 million at December 31, 2019 versus $2.2 million at December 31, 2018. During 2019, we added properties totaling $1.3 million, sold properties totaling $2.3 million, and recorded valuation adjustments totaling $0.3 million. For 2018, we added properties totaling $2.1 million, sold properties totaling $2.8 million, and recorded valuation adjustments totaling $0.1 million. The composition of our OREO portfolio as of December 31 is provided in the table below. (Dollars in Thousands) 2019 2018 Lots/Land $ 87 $ 1,030 Residential 1-4 383 655 Commercial Building 123 64 Other 360 480 Total OREO $ 953 $ 2,229 Troubled Debt Restructurings. TDRs are loans on which, due to the deterioration in the borrower financial condition, the original terms have been modified and deemed a concession to the borrower. From time to time we will modify a loan as a workout alternative. Most of these instances involve an extension of the loan term, an interest rate reduction, or a principal moratorium. A TDR classification can be removed if the borrower financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, and the loan is subsequently refinanced or restructured at market terms and qualifies as a new loan in calendar years after the year in which the restructuring took place. Loans classified as TDRs at December 31, 2019 totaled $17.6 million compared to $24.7 million at December 31, 2018. Accruing TDRs made up approximately $16.9 million, or 95%, of our TDR portfolio at December 31, 2019 of which $0.5 million was over 30 days past due. The weighted average rate for the loans within the accruing TDR portfolio was 5.4%. During 2019, we modified seven loan contracts totaling approximately $0.5 million. Our TDR default rate (default balance as a percentage of average TDRs) in 2019 and 2018 was 3% and 4%, respectively. 48 The composition of our TDR portfolio as of December 31 is provided in the table below. 2019 2018 (Dollars in Thousands) Accruing Nonaccruing (1) Accruing Nonaccruing (1) Commercial, Financial and Agricultural $ 495 $ 55 $ 873 $ - Real Estate Construction - - 59 - Real Estate Commercial Mortgage 7,787 176 9,910 1,239 Real Estate Residential 7,083 379 9,234 1,222 Real Estate Home Equity 1,452 105 1,920 179 Consumer 71 - 88 - Total TDRs $ 16,888 $ 715 $ 22,084 $ 2,640 (1) Nonaccruing TDRs are included in NAL totals and NAL/NPA ratio calculations.

A loan is defined as a past due loan when one full payment is past due or a contractual maturity is over 30 days past due. Past due loans at December 31, 2019 totaled $4.9 million compared to $4.8 million at December 31, 2018. Potential Problem Loans . Potential problem loans are defined as those loans which are now current but where management has doubt as to the borrower ability to comply with present loan repayment terms. At December 31, 2019, we had $2.5 million in loans of this type which were not included in either of the nonaccrual, TDR or 90 day past due loan categories compared to $4.0 million at December 31, 2018. Management monitors these loans closely and reviews their performance on a regular basis. Loan Concentrations . Loan concentrations exist when there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities which cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions and such amount exceeds 10% of total loans. Due to the lack of diversified industry within our markets and the relatively close proximity of the markets, we have both geographic concentrations as well as concentrations in the types of loans funded. Specifically, due to the nature of our markets, a significant portion of our loan portfolio has historically been secured with real estate, approximately 71% at December 31, 2019 and 70% at December 31, 2018. The primary types of real estate collateral are commercial properties and 1-4 family residential properties. At December 31, 2019, commercial real estate and residential real estate mortgage loans (including home equity loans) accounted for 37% and 34%, respectively, of the total loan portfolio. The following table summarizes our real estate loan portfolio as segregated by the type of property. Property type concentrations are stated as a percentage of December 31 st total real estate loans. 2019 2018 Investor Real Estate Owner Occupied Real Estate Investor Real Estate Owner Occupied Real Estate Vacant Land, Construction, and Land Development 13.1 % - 11.0 % - Improved Property 25.8 61.1 % 26.0 63.0 % Total Real Estate Loans 38.9 % 61.1 % 37.0 % 63.0 % A major portion of our real estate loan portfolio is centered in the owner occupied category which carries a lower risk of non-collection than certain segments of the investor category. Approximately 36% of the investor real estate category was secured by residential real estate at December 31, 2019. 49 Allowance for Loan Losses We believe that we maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to provide for probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Credit losses arise from the borrowers inability or unwillingness to repay, and from other risks inherent in the lending process including collateral risk, operations risk, concentration risk, and economic risk. We consider all of these risks of lending when assessing the adequacy of our allowance. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision charged to expense. Loans are charged-off against the allowance when losses are probable and reasonably quantifiable. Our allowance for loan losses is based on management's judgment of overall credit quality, which is a significant estimate based on a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio. Our allowance can and will change based on revisions to our assessment of our loan portfolio's overall credit quality and other risk factors both internal and external to us. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis. The allowance consists of two components. The first component consists of amounts reserved for impaired loans. A loan is deemed impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the bank will not be able to collect all amounts due (principal and interest payments), according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans are monitored for potential impairment through our ongoing loan review procedures and portfolio analysis. Classified loans and past due loans over a specific dollar amount, and all troubled debt restructurings are individually evaluated for impairment. The approach for assigning reserves for the impaired loans is determined by the dollar amount of the loan and loan type. Impairment measurement for loans over a specific dollar are assigned on an individual loan basis with the amount reserved dependent on whether repayment of the loan is dependent on the liquidation of collateral or from some other source of repayment. If repayment is dependent on the sale of collateral, the reserve is equivalent to the recorded investment in the loan less the fair value of the collateral after estimated sales expenses. If repayment is not dependent on the sale of collateral, the reserve is equivalent to the recorded investment in the loan less the estimated cash flows discounted using the loan effective interest rate. The discounted value of the cash flows is based on the anticipated timing of the receipt of cash payments from the borrower. The reserve allocations for individually measured impaired loans are sensitive to the extent market conditions or the actual timing of cash receipts change. Impairment reserves for smaller-balance loans under a specific dollar amount are assigned on a pooled basis utilizing loss factors for impaired loans of a similar nature. The second component is a general reserve on all loans other than those identified as impaired. General reserves are assigned to various homogenous loan pools, including commercial, commercial real estate, construction, residential 1-4 family, home equity, and consumer. General reserves are assigned based on historical loan loss ratios determined by loan pool and internal risk ratings that are adjusted for various internal and external risk factors unique to each loan pool. On January 1, 2020, we will adopt a new accounting standard which replaces the incurred loss model for measuring credit losses discussed above with a new expected loss model. We discuss this accounting standard and its potential impact on the allowance for loan losses in the Recently Issued Accounting Standards section on page 62. Table 9 analyzes the activity in the allowance over the past five years. For 2019, our net loan charge-offs totaled $2.3 million, or 0.13%, of average loans, compared to $2.0 million, or 0.12%, for 2018, and $2.3 million, or 0.14%, for 2017. At December 31, 2019, the allowance for loan losses was 0.75% of outstanding loans (net of overdrafts) and provided coverage of 311% of nonperforming loans compared to 0.80% and 207%, respectively, at December 31, 2018, and 0.80% and 186%, respectively, at December 31, 2017. Table 10 provides an allocation of the allowance for loan losses to specific loan types for each of the past five years. The allowance for loan losses totaled $13.9 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $14.2 million at December 31, 2018 and $13.3 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in 2019 reflected a $0.7 million decrease in impaired loan reserves partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in general reserves. For 2018 and 2019, lower impaired loan balances drove the reduction in impaired loan reserves and growth in our loan portfolio drove the increase in general reserves. We believe our allowance at December 31, 2019 was adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. 50 Table 9 ANALYSIS OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES (Dollars in Thousands) 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 Balance at Beginning of Year $ 14,210 $ 13,307 $ 13,431 $ 13,953 $ 17,539 Charge-Offs: Commercial, Financial and Agricultural 768 644 1,357 861 1,029 Real Estate Construction 281 7 - - - Real Estate Commercial 214 315 685 349 1,250 Real Estate Residential 400 780 411 899 1,852 Real Estate Home Equity 430 533 190 450 1,403 Consumer 2,878 2,395 2,193 2,127 1,901 Total Charge-Offs 4,971 4,674 4,836 4,686 7,435 Recoveries: Commercial, Financial and Agricultural 345 459 313 337 239 Real Estate Construction - 26 50 - - Real Estate Commercial 578 373 174 408 183 Real Estate Residential 429 643 616 1,231 705 Real Estate Home Equity 175 191 219 409 136 Consumer 1,112 964 1,125 960 992 Total Recoveries 2,639 2,656 2,497 3,345 2,255 Net Charge-Offs 2,332 2,018 2,339 1,341 5,180 Provision for Loan Losses 2,027 2,921 2,215 819 1,594 Balance at End of Year $ 13,905 $ 14,210 $ 13,307 $ 13,431 $ 13,953 Ratio of Net Charge-Offs to Average Loans Outstanding 0.13 % 0.12 % 0.14 % 0.09 % 0.35 % Allowance for Loan Losses as a Percent of Loans at End of Year 0.75 % 0.80 % 0.80 % 0.86 % 0.93 % Allowance for Loan Losses as a Multiple of Net Charge-Offs 5.96 x 7.04 x 5.69 x 10.02 x 2.69 x 51 Table 10 ALLOCATION OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 (Dollars in Thousands) Allow-ance Amount Percent of Loans in Each Category To Total Loans Allow-ance Amount Percent of Loans in Each Category To Total Loans Allow-ance Amount Percent of Loans in Each Category To Total Loans Allow-ance Amount Percent of Loans in Each Category To Total Loans Allow-ance Amount Percent of Loans in Each Category To Total Loans Commercial, Financial and Agricultural $ 1,675 13.9 % $ 1,434 13.1 % $ 1,191 13.2 % $ 1,198 13.8 % $ 905 12.0 % Real Estate: Construction 370 6.2 280 5.0 122 4.7 168 3.7 101 3.1 Commercial 3,416 33.9 4,181 33.8 4,346 32.3 4,315 32.1 4,498 33.2 Residential 3,128 20.1 3,400 19.6 3,206 19.1 3,445 18.6 4,409 20.0 Home Equity 2,224 10.7 2,301 11.8 2,506 13.8 2,297 15.0 2,473 15.6 Consumer 3,092 15.2 2,614 16.7 1,936 16.9 2,008 16.8 1,567 16.1 Total $ 13,905 100.0 % $ 14,210 100.0 % $ 13,307 100.0 % $ 13,431 100.0 % $ 13,953 100.0 % Investment Securities Our average investment portfolio balance decreased $71.1 million, or 10.1%, in 2018 and increased $14.5 million, or 2.1%, in 2018. As a percentage of average earning assets, our investment portfolio represented 23.6% in 2019, compared to 27.6% in 2018. In 2019, we strategically did not reinvest all cash flows from the investment portfolio to account for loan growth, and to provide liquidity for potential deposit runoff. We currently believe a relatively short duration investment portfolio offers the flexibility to provide additional liquidity from maturing bonds, if necessary. In 2019, average taxable investments decreased $28.6 million, or 4.5%, while tax-exempt investments decreased $42.6 million, or 63.5%. Taxable bonds declined as part of our overall investment strategy, and non-taxable investments decreased as the tax-equivalent yield was generally unattractive throughout 2019 given the changes from the Tax Act in late 2017. At December 31, 2019, municipal securities (taxable and non-taxable) comprised 1.2% of the portfolio. We may consider the purchase of municipal issues if the yields are attractive given the lower federal tax rate related to the recent changes under the Tax Act. We may also consider municipal issues that are CRA-eligible investments. Our investment portfolio is a significant component of our operations and, as such, it functions as a key element of liquidity and asset/liability management. Two types of classifications are approved for investment securities which are Available-for-Sale ( AFS ) and Held-for-Maturity ( HTM ). In 2018 and 2019, we purchased securities under both the AFS and HTM designations. At December 31, 2019, $403.6 million, or 62.8% of our investment portfolio was classified as AFS, with the remaining $239.5 million, or 37.2%, classified as HTM. At December 31, 2018, the AFS and HTM portfolio comprised 67.2% and 32.8%, respectively.

Classification determinations will also factor in regulatory capital requirements, volatility in earnings or other comprehensive income, and liquidity needs. Securities in the AFS portfolio are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses associated with these securities recorded net of tax, in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of shareowners equity. Securities designated as HTM are those acquired or owned with the intent of holding them to maturity (final payment date). HTM investments are measured at amortized cost. It is neither management current intent nor practice to participate in the trading of investment securities for the purpose of recognizing gains and therefore we do not maintain a trading portfolio. At December 31, 2019, there were 189 positions (combined AFS and HTM) with unrealized losses totaling $0.6 million. GNMA mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasuries, and SBA securities carry the full faith and credit guarantee of the U.S. Government, and are 0% risk-weighted assets. SBA securities float monthly or quarterly with the prime rate and are uncapped. None of these positions with unrealized losses are considered impaired, and all are expected to mature at par. The table below provides a break-down of our unrealized losses by security type.

Balances of U.S. Treasuries and municipal bonds declined compared to the prior year, and were partially offset by increases in SBA and GNMA securities. The average life of our investment portfolio was unchanged as slightly longer maturities (out to five years) were purchased which offset the existing portfolio rolling down the curve. See Table 12 for a break-down of maturities by investment type. The weighted average taxable equivalent yield of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 was 2.23% versus 2.20% in 2018. This increase in yield reflected the reinvestment of proceeds from lower yielding securities into higher yielding securities during 2019. Our bond portfolio contained no investments in obligations, other than U.S. Governments, of any state, municipality, political subdivision or any other issuer that exceeded 10% of our shareowners equity at December 31, 2019. 53 Table 12 and Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements present a detailed analysis of our investment securities as to type, maturity and yield at December 31.

(3) Weighted average yield calculated based on current amortized cost balances not presented on a tax equivalent basis. Deposits and Funds Purchased Average total deposits for 2019 were $2.537 billion, an increase of $114.5 million, or 4.7%, over 2018. Average deposits increased $51.1 million, or 2.2%, from 2017 to 2018. The year-over-year increase compared to 2018 occurred in noninterest bearing deposits, negotiated NOW accounts, and savings accounts, partially offset by decreases in the money market accounts and certificates of deposit. Increases in 2018 compared to 2017 were experienced in noninterest bearing deposits and savings accounts, partially offset by declines in the remaining deposit types. The seasonal inflow of public funds started in the fourth quarter of 2019 and is expected to continue into the first quarter of 2020. Deposit levels remain strong as we continue to see growth in our non-maturity deposits. Our mix of deposits continues to improve as certificates of deposit are replaced with noninterest bearing demand accounts. We continue to closely monitor several metrics such as the sensitivity of our deposit rates, our overall liquidity position, and competitor rates when pricing deposits. This strategy is consistent with previous rate cycles, and allows us to manage the mix of our deposits rather than compete on rate. We believe this enabled us to maintain a low cost of funds of 35 basis points for 2019 and 27 basis points for 2018. Table 2 provides an analysis of our average deposits, by category, and average rates paid thereon for each of the last three years. Table 13 reflects the shift in our deposit mix over the last year and Table 14 provides a maturity distribution of time deposits in denominations of $100,000 and over at December 31, 2019. 54 Average short-term borrowings, which include federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances (maturing in less than one year), and other borrowings, decreased $1.7 million, or 15.6% in 2019. The lower balance was primarily attributable to decreases in repurchase agreements. See Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on short-term borrowings. We continue to focus on the value of our deposit franchise, which produces a strong base of core deposits with minimal reliance on wholesale funding.

Market risk arises from changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices. We have risk management policies designed to monitor and limit exposure to market risk and we do not participate in activities that give rise to significant market risk involving exchange rates, commodity prices, or equity prices. In asset and liability management activities, our policies are designed to minimize structural interest rate risk. Interest Rate Risk Management. Our net income is largely dependent on net interest income. Net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the degree that interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than interest-earning assets. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets in a given period, a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling market interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income. Net interest income is also affected by changes in the portion of interest-earning assets that are funded by interest-bearing liabilities rather than by other sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and shareowners equity. 55 We have established what we believe to be a comprehensive interest rate risk management policy, which is administered by management Asset Liability Management Committee ( ALCO ). The policy establishes limits of risk, which are quantitative measures of the percentage change in net interest income (a measure of net interest income at risk) and the fair value of equity capital (a measure of economic value of equity ( EVE ) at risk) resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for maturities from one day to 30 years. We measure the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on our short-term earnings, long-term value, and liquidity by employing simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling. The simulation model captures optionality factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors imbedded in investment and loan portfolio contracts. As with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology used by us. When interest rates change, actual movements in different categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, loan prepayments, and withdrawals of time and other deposits, may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the model. Finally, the methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable-rate loan clients ability to service their debts, or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan and deposit products. The balance sheet is subject to testing for interest rate shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk. We prepare a current base case and several alternative interest rate simulations (-100,+100, +200, +300, and +400 basis points (bp)), at least once per quarter, and report the analysis to ALCO, our Market Risk Oversight Committee ( MROC ), our Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee ( EROC ) and the Board of Directors. (The -200bp rate scenario was not modeled starting in the second half of 2019 due to the low interest rate environment below 2.00%). We augment our interest rate shock analysis with alternative interest rate scenarios on a quarterly basis that may include ramps, parallel shifts, and a flattening or steepening of the yield curve (non-parallel shift). In addition, more frequent forecasts may be produced when interest rates are particularly uncertain or when other business conditions so dictate. Our goal is to structure the balance sheet so that net interest earnings at risk over 12-month and 24-month periods and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels. We attempt to achieve this goal by balancing, within policy limits, the volume of floating-rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating-rate assets, by keeping the average maturity of fixed-rate asset and liability contracts reasonably matched, by managing the mix of our core deposits, and by adjusting our rates to market conditions on a continuing basis. During the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019, instantaneous rate shocks of down 100 bp over 24-months were outside of desired parameters due to limited repricing of deposits relative to the decline in rates. Analysis. Measures of net interest income at risk produced by simulation analysis are indicators of an institution short-term performance in alternative rate environments. These measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period, and do not necessarily indicate the long-term prospects or economic value of the institution. ESTIMATED CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME (1) Percentage Change (12-month shock) +400 bp +300 bp +200 bp +100 bp -100 bp -200 bp Policy Limit -15.0 % -12.5 % -10.0 % -7.5 % -7.5 % -10.0 % December 31, 2019 13.8 % 10.3 % 6.8 % 3.4 % -6.2 % n/a December 31, 2018 8.9 % 6.6 % 4.3 % 2.3 % -5.0 % -12.4 % Percentage Change (24-month shock) +400 bp +300 bp +200 bp +100 bp -100 bp -200 bp Policy Limit -17.5 % -15.0 % -12.5 % -10.0 % -10.0 % -12.5 % December 31, 2019 35.5 % 26.4 % 17.2 % 8.2 % -13.4 % n/a December 31, 2018 37.2 % 29.1 % 21.0 % 13.4 % -6.4 % -20.0 % The Net Interest Income ( NII ) at Risk position was more favorable at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 for the 12-month shock for all rate scenarios except the down 100 bp scenario, where it became less favorable. The year-over-year favorable changes were primarily driven by growth in our noninterest bearing deposits, which have a positive impact on our NII. The model indicates that in the short-term, all rising rate environments will positively impact the net interest margin of the Company, while a declining rate environment of 100 bp will have a negative impact on the net interest margin. All measures of Net Interest Income at Risk are within our prescribed policy limits over both the 12-month and 24-month periods, with the exception of rates down 100 bp over 24-months. We are out of compliance in the rates down 100 bp scenarios as we have a limited ability to lower our deposit rates the full 100 bp relative to the decline in market rate. In addition, this analysis incorporates an instantaneous, parallel shock and assumes we move with market rates and do not lag our deposit rates. 56 The measures of equity value at risk indicate our ongoing economic value by considering the effects of changes in interest rates on all of our cash flows by discounting the cash flows to estimate the present value of assets and liabilities. The difference between these discounted values of the assets and liabilities is the economic value of equity, which in theory approximates the fair value of our net assets. ESTIMATED CHANGES IN ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY (1) Changes in Interest Rates +400 bp +300 bp +200 bp +100 bp -100 bp -200 bp Policy Limit -30.0 % -25.0 % -20.0 % -15.0 % -15.0 % -20.0 % December 31, 2019 37.5 % 30.2 % 21.7 % 12.2 % -22.0 % n./a December 31, 2018 24.6 % 19.7 % 13.9 % 8.0 % -13.8 % -36.8 % At December 31, 2019, the economic value of equity was more favorable in all rate scenarios except the down 100 bp scenario when compared to December 31, 2018. The year-over-year favorable changes were primarily driven by growth in our noninterest bearing deposits compared to the prior year. EVE became less favorable in rates down 100bp compared to the prior year as we have limited ability to lower our deposit rates relative to the decline in market rates. Note that a recent update to the ALM policy defines an out-of-compliance position for EVE only if both of the following occur: EVE metrics are outside of guidelines and the EVE ratio (economic value of equity/economic value of assets) is below 5.0%. Since the EVE ratio was 6.8% at December 31, 2019, EVE was within compliance. As the interest rate environment and the dynamics of the economy continue to change, additional simulations will be analyzed to address not only the changing rate environment, but also the changing balance sheet mix, measured over multiple years, to help assess the risk to the Company. (1) Down 300 and 400 bp rate scenarios have been excluded due to the current interest rate environment. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity In general terms, liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet our cash needs. Our objective in managing our liquidity is to maintain our ability to fund loan commitments, purchase securities, accommodate deposit withdrawals or repay other liabilities in accordance with their terms, without an adverse impact on our current or future earnings. Our liquidity strategy is guided by policies that are formulated and monitored by our ALCO and senior management, and which take into account the marketability of assets, the sources and stability of funding and the level of unfunded commitments. We regularly evaluate all of our various funding sources with an emphasis on accessibility, stability, reliability and cost-effectiveness. For 2019 and 2018, our principal source of funding was client deposits, supplemented by our short-term and long-term borrowings, primarily from our trust-preferred securities, securities sold under repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased and FHLB borrowings. We believe that the cash generated from operations, our borrowing capacity and our access to capital resources are sufficient to meet our future operating capital and funding requirements. At December 31, 2019, we had the ability to generate approximately $1.282 billion in additional liquidity through all of our available resources beyond our overnight funds sold position. In addition to the primary borrowing outlets mentioned above, we also have the ability to generate liquidity by borrowing from the Federal Reserve Discount Window and through brokered deposits. We recognize the importance of maintaining liquidity and have developed a Contingent Liquidity Plan, which addresses various liquidity stress levels and our response and action based on the level of severity. We periodically test our credit facilities for access to the funds, but also understand that as the severity of the liquidity level increases certain credit facilities may no longer be available. We conduct quarterly liquidity stress tests and the results are reported to ALCO, MROC, EROC and the Board of Directors. We believe the liquidity available to us is sufficient to meet our ongoing needs. We also view our investment portfolio as a liquidity source and have the option to pledge securities in our portfolio as collateral for borrowings or deposits, and/or sell selected securities. Our portfolio consists of debt issued by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. governmental agencies, and municipal governments. The weighted-average maturity of our portfolio was 2.11 years at December 31, 2019 and had a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $1.2 million in the AFS portfolio. Our average net overnight funds sold position (defined as funds sold plus interest-bearing deposits with other banks less funds purchased) was $238.0 million in 2019 compared to an average net overnight funds sold position of $135.4 million in 2018. The increase in this position in 2019 reflected strong deposit growth (primarily driven by noninterest bearing deposits) and runoff from the investment portfolio, partially offset by higher growth in the loan portfolio. 57 We expect capital expenditures over the next 12 months to be approximately $7.0 million, which will consist primarily of technology purchases for banking offices, business applications, and information technology security needs as well as furniture and fixtures and banking office remodels. We expect that these capital expenditures will be funded with existing resources without impairing our ability to meet our ongoing obligations. Borrowings At December 31, 2019, total advances from the FHLB consisted of $5.4 million in outstanding debt comprised of nine notes. In 2019, the Bank made FHLB advance payments totaling $4.6 million. One advance matured, and one was paid off, with no new fixed rate advances obtained in 2019. The FHLB notes are collateralized by a blanket floating lien on all of our 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans, and home equity mortgage loans. We have issued two junior subordinated deferrable interest notes to wholly owned Delaware statutory trusts. The first note for $30.9 million was issued to CCBG Capital Trust I in November 2004. The second note for $32.0 million was issued to CCBG Capital Trust II in May 2005. See Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these borrowings. Table 15 CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS Table 15 sets forth certain information about contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2019. Payments Due By Period (Dollars in Thousands) < 1 Yr > 1 3 Yrs > 3 5 Yrs > 5 Yrs Total Federal Home Loan Bank Advances $ 1,282 $ 3,500 $ 456 $ 115 $ 5,353 Note Payable 296 592 592 20 1,500 Subordinated Notes Payable - - - 52,887 52,887 Operating Lease Obligations 515 842 779 702 2,838 Time Deposit Maturities 87,805 14,836 3,380 - 106,021 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 89,898 $ 19,770 $ 5,207 $ 53,724 $ 168,599 Capital Shareowners equity was $327.0 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $302.6 million at December 31, 2018. During 2019, shareowners equity was positively impacted by net income of $30.8 million, stock compensation accretion of $1.5 million, net adjustments totaling $1.3 million related to transactions under our stock compensation plans, and $2.8 million increase in the unrealized gain on investment securities. Shareowners equity was reduced by common stock dividends of $8.0 million ($0.48 per share), a $2.2 million increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss for our pension plan, and share repurchases (77,000 shares) of $1.8 million. S hareowners' equity as of December 31, for each of the last three years is presented below: (Dollars in Thousands) 2019 2018 2017 Common Stock $ 168 $ 167 $ 170 Additional Paid-in Capital 32,092 31,058 36,674 Retained Earnings 322,937 300,177 279,410 Subtotal 355,197 331,402 316,254 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, Net of Tax (28,181) (28,815) (32,044) Total Shareowners Equity $ 327,016 $ 302,587 $ 284,210 We continue to maintain a strong capital position. The ratio of shareowners' equity to total assets at year-end was 10.59%, 10.23%, and 9.80%, in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We believe our strong capital base offers protection during an economic downturn and provides sufficient capacity to meet our current strategic objectives. 58 We are subject to risk-based capital guidelines that measure capital relative to risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. At December 31, 2019, we had a total risk-based capital ratio of 17.90% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 17.16%, compared to 17.13% and 16.36%, respectively, at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.47%, compared to 13.58% at December 31, 2018. Our leverage ratio at December 31, 2019, was 11.25% compared to 10.89% at December 31, 2018. For a detailed discussion of our regulatory capital requirements, refer to the Regulatory Considerations Capital Regulations section on page 16. See Note 15 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information as to our capital adequacy. At December 31, 2019, our common stock had a book value of $19.40 per diluted share compared to $18.00 at December 31, 2018. Book value is impacted by the net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities. At December 31, 2019, the net unrealized gain was $0.9 million compared to a $2.0 million net unrealized loss at December 31, 2018. Book value is also impacted by the recording of our unfunded pension liability through other comprehensive income in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 715. At December 31, 2019, the net pension liability reflected in other comprehensive loss was $29.0 million compared to $26.8 million at December 31, 2018. In February 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1,500,000 shares of our outstanding common stock over a five-year period. Repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions; however, we are not obligated to repurchase any specified number of shares. In January, 2019, the 2014 plan was terminated and our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan that authorizes the repurchase of up to 750,000 shares of our outstanding common stock over a five-year period. Terms of this plan are substantially similar to the 2014 plan. 77,000 shares were repurchased in 2019 at an average price of $23.40 and 324,441 shares were repurchased during 2018 at an average price of $24.75. No shares were repurchased in 2017. Since 2014, a total of 1,261,730 shares of our outstanding common stock have been repurchased at an average price of $17.74 under our stock repurchase plans. Dividends Adequate capital and financial strength is paramount to our stability and the stability of our subsidiary bank. Cash dividends declared and paid should not place unnecessary strain on our capital levels. When determining the level of dividends the following factors are considered: Compliance with state and federal laws and regulations; Our capital position and our ability to meet our financial obligations; Projected earnings and asset levels; and The ability of the Bank and us to fund dividends. Inflation The impact of inflation on the banking industry differs significantly from that of other industries in which a large portion of total resources are invested in fixed assets such as property, plant and equipment. Assets and liabilities of financial institutions are virtually all monetary in nature, and therefore are primarily impacted by interest rates rather than changing prices. While the general level of inflation underlies most interest rates, interest rates react more to changes in the expected rate of inflation and to changes in monetary and fiscal policy. Net interest income and the interest rate spread are good measures of our ability to react to changing interest rates and are discussed in further detail in the section entitled Results of Operations. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not currently engage in the use of derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks. However, we are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our clients. See Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2019, we had $519.2 million in commitments to extend credit and $5.8 million in standby letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a client so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. We use the same credit policies in establishing commitments and issuing letters of credit as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. 59 If commitments arising from these financial instruments continue to require funding at historical levels, management does not anticipate that such funding will adversely impact our ability to meet on-going obligations. In the event these commitments require funding in excess of historical levels, management believes current liquidity, investment security maturities, available advances from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank provide a sufficient source of funds to meet these commitments. FOURTH QUARTER, 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS Results of Operations We realized net income of $8.6 million, or $0.51 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to net income of $8.5 million, or $0.50 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2019. The increase in earnings reflected a $1.0 million decrease in the loan loss provision, lower income taxes of $0.4 million, and a $0.1 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense of $1.3 million and lower noninterest income of $0.1 million. Tax-equivalent net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $26.4 million compared to $26.3 million for the third quarter of 2019. The increase reflected growth in our overnight funds and loans which offset the unfavorable rate variance due to the lower overnight funds rate. Our net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3.89% (annualized), a decrease of three basis points from the third quarter of 2019, primarily attributable to the growth and composition of our earning assets. Our provision for loan losses for the fourth quarter of 2019 was negative $0.2 million compared to a provision expense of $0.8 million for the third quarter of 2019. The decrease in the provision was primarily attributable to a lower level of net loan losses. N et loan charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled $0.3 million compared to net loan charge-offs of $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2019. Noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled $13.8 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 0.5%, from the third quarter of 2019 and reflected a $0.2 million reduction in wealth management fees partially offset by a $0.1 million increase in bank card fees. Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled $29.1 million, an increase of $1.3 million, or 4.6%, over the third quarter of 2019. The increase was attributable to higher compensation expense (primarily incentives) of $1.2 million and legal/professional fees of $0.5 million (related to the Brand Mortgage, LLC transaction), partially offset by lower processing fees of $0.3 million and advertising costs of $0.1 million. We realized income tax expense of $2.5 million (effective rate of 22.9%) for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to $3.0 million (effective rate of 25.9%) for the third quarter of 2019. Income tax expense for the third quarter of 2019 was unfavorably impacted by net discrete items totaling $0.3 million. Discussion of Financial Condition Average earning assets were $2.695 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $24.6 million, or 0.9%, over the third quarter of 2019 attributable to a higher level of deposits, primarily noninterest bearing accounts. Average loans increased $8.6 million, or 0.5% compared to the third quarter of 2019 and reflected growth in all our loan types except institutional loans, consumer loans, and home equity loans. Nonperforming assets (nonaccrual loans and OREO) totaled $5.4 million at December 31, 2019, comparable to September 30, 2019. Nonaccrual loans totaled $4.5 million at December 31, 2019, a $0.5 million decrease from September 30, 2019 and OREO totaled $1.0 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $0.4 million over September 30, 2019. Average total deposits were $2.525 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $29.2 million, or 1.2%, over the third quarter of 2019 and primarily reflected an increase in noninterest bearing deposits, partially offset by declines in money market accounts and certificates of deposit. ACCOUNTING POLICIES Critical Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make various estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We believe that, of our significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. 60 Allowance for Loan Losses . The allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which represents management best estimate of probable losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance is the amount considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on management evaluation of credit risk as of the balance sheet date. Our allowance for loan losses includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The level of the allowance reflects management continuing evaluation of specific credit risks, loss experience, loan portfolio quality, economic conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio, as well as trends in the foregoing. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as information becomes available. Our allowance for loan losses consists of two components: (i) specific reserves established for probable losses on impaired loans; and (ii) general reserves for non-homogenous loans not deemed impaired and homogenous loan pools based on, but not limited to, historical loan loss experience, current economic and market conditions, levels of past due loans, and levels of problem loans. Our financial results are affected by the changes in and the absolute level of the allowance for loan losses. This estimation process is judgmental and requires an estimate of the loss severity rates that we apply to our unimpaired loan portfolio. Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets. We perform an impairment review on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Adverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations, or other factors could result in a decline in the estimated implied fair value of goodwill. If the estimated implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, a loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to the estimated implied fair value. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and in 2017 adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying Accounting for Goodwill Impairment which allows for a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment indicators. If the assessment indicates that impairment has more than likely occurred, the Company must compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the excess. During the fourth quarter, we performed our annual impairment testing. We proceeded with qualitative assessment by evaluating impairment indicators and concluded there were none that indicated that goodwill impairment had occurred. Pension Assumptions . We have a defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of substantially all of our associates. Our funding policy with respect to the pension plan is to contribute, at a minimum, amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements as set by law. Pension expense is determined by an external actuarial valuation based on assumptions that are evaluated annually as of December 31, the measurement date for the pension obligation. The service cost component of pension expense is reflected as Compensation Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. All other components of pension expense are reflected as Other Expense . The Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition reflect an accrued pension benefit cost due to funding levels and unrecognized actuarial amounts. The most significant assumptions used in calculating the pension obligation are the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligation, the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and the assumed rate of annual compensation increases. These assumptions are re-evaluated annually with the external actuaries, taking into consideration both current market conditions and anticipated long-term market conditions. The discount rate is determined by matching the anticipated defined pension plan cash flows to the spot rates of a corporate Aa-rated bond index/yield curve and solving for the single equivalent discount rate which would produce the same present value. This methodology is applied consistently from year-to-year. The discount rate utilized in 2019 was 4.43%. The estimated impact to 2019 pension expense of a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have been a decrease and increase of approximately $844,000 and $801,000, respectively. We anticipate using a 3.53% discount rate in 2020. Based on the balances at the December 31, 2019 measurement date, the estimated after tax impact in accumulated other comprehensive income of a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate is a decrease or increase of approximately $5.8 million. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the current and anticipated future mix of assets in the plan. The assets currently consist of equity securities, U.S. Government and Government agency debt securities, and other securities (typically temporary liquid funds awaiting investment). The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilized for 2019 was 7.25%. The estimated impact to 2019 pension expense of a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the rate of return would have been an approximate $329,000 increase or decrease, respectively. We anticipate using a rate of return on plan assets for 2020 in the range of 7.0% to 7.25%. 61 The assumed rate of annual compensation increases of 3.25% in 2019 reflected expected trends in salaries and the employee base. We anticipate using a compensation increase of 4.00% for 2020 reflecting current market trends. Detailed information on the pension plan, the actuarially determined disclosures, and the assumptions used are provided in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes . Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. We recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in other expenses. Recently Issued Accounting Standards The Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and other regulatory bodies have enacted new accounting pronouncements and standards that either have impacted our results in prior years presented, or will likely impact our results in 2020. Please refer to Note 1 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 1, 2020, we will adopt a new accounting standard ( ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Statements ) which will replace the incurred loss model for measuring credit losses discussed above with a new expected loss model. ASU 2016-13 along with several other subsequent codification updates related to accounting for credit losses, requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts and requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization portfolio. In addition, ASU 2016-13 amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. While the implementation of the standard changes the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, it does not change the credit risk of our lending portfolios or the losses of these portfolios. We are currently finalizing the execution of our implementation controls and processes; therefore, the ultimate impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 as of January 1, 2020 could differ from our current expectation. We currently expect the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will result in a combined 20% to 30% increase in our allowance for loan losses and reserves for unfunded commitments. Furthermore, ASU 2016-13 will necessitate that we establish an allowance for expected credit losses for certain debt securities and other financial assets; however, a majority of our investment securities are government guaranteed treasuries or government agency-backed securities for which the risk of loss is minimal. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a significant impact on our regulatory capital ratios. Future estimates of the allowance for credit losses will depend on the characteristics of our portfolios, as well as macroeconomic conditions and forecasts, changes and enhancements to models and methodologies, and other management judgments.
