Consolidated results of operations and financial condition are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes included elsewhere herein. Results of operations include the accounts of The Hanover Insurance Company ( Hanover Insurance ) and Citizens Insurance Company of America ( Citizens ), our principal U.S. domiciled property and casualty companies; Chaucer Holdings plc ( Chaucer ), and certain other insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries. Effective July 1, 2011, we acquired Chaucer, a specialist insurance underwriting group which operates through the Society and Corporation of Lloyd ( Lloyds ) and is domiciled in the United Kingdom ( U.K. ). Results of operations include Chaucer results in periods subsequent to July 1, 2011. Accordingly, our results for the year ended December 31, 2010 do not include any results from Chaucer and our results for the year ended December 31, 2011 include Chaucer results for only the period from July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 include results from all of our business segments. Additionally, results of operations include our discontinued operations, consisting primarily of our former life insurance businesses, accident and health business and third party administration business. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Business operations consist of four operating segments: Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, Chaucer and Other Property and Casualty. Segment income excluding income taxes and interest was $75.1 million in 2012 compared to $71.8 million in 2011. The increase in our pre-tax segment income in 2012 was primarily due to a $103.9 million increase in Chaucer segment income, reflecting a full year of results from operations for Chaucer compared to only six months of results in 2011, and to lower loss activity in most Chaucer product classes. The increase from our Chaucer segment was partially offset by a $96.6 million decrease in Commercial Lines segment income, which was primarily due to unfavorable development on prior years loss and loss adjustment expense ( LAE ) reserves and from increased catastrophe losses in 2012, primarily as a result of Superstorm Sandy. For all segments combined, pre-tax catastrophe losses, although relatively flat year over year, were at elevated levels, with catastrophe losses of $369.9 million during 2012, compared to $361.6 million for 2011. Catastrophe losses in 2012 were primarily the result of $198.1 million of pre-tax losses related to Superstorm Sandy during the fourth quarter, and from several tornadoes during the first six months of the year. Our 2011 catastrophe losses resulted principally from winter storms, tornado, hail and windstorm activity in the first half of the year, and from Hurricane Irene and floods in Thailand and Denmark during the second half of the year. During 2012, $72.6 million of favorable development related to our Chaucer segment was partially offset by $56.8 million of unfavorable development related to our domestic operations. During 2011, $67.8 million of favorable development was related to our domestic operations and $35.5 million related to our Chaucer segment. In several recent years, weather-related catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses have been in excess of longer term averages. Pricing in our Commercial and Personal Lines continues to improve as the industry responds to these increased weather-related losses, as well as to the earnings impact of reduced investment income as a result of low interest rates, and other factors. We are continuing efforts to improve our underwriting results in both our Commercial and Personal Lines, including through rate increases and improvements to our mix of business. Commercial Lines We believe our unique approach to the small commercial market, distinctiveness in the middle market, and continued development of specialty lines provides us with a diversified portfolio of products and delivers significant value to agents and policyholders. The small commercial and middle market businesses are expected to contribute to premium growth in Commercial Lines over the next several years as we continue to pursue our core strategy of developing strong partnerships with agents, distinctive products, franchise value through limited distribution, and industry segmentation. Growth in our specialty lines continues to be an important part of our strategy, with the expansion of our product offerings in these lines supported by several acquisitions of specialized business. We believe these efforts have driven, and will continue to drive, improvement in our overall mix of business and ultimately our underwriting profitability. Commercial Lines net written premium grew by 11.7% in 2012, driven by both our core commercial businesses and specialty businesses. This growth is primarily due to rate increases, strong retention and targeted new business expansion. Losses and LAE expenses were higher in 2012 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to unfavorable development on prior 41 Table of Contents years loss reserves and increased catastrophe losses related to Superstorm Sandy. Unfavorable development of prior years loss reserves during 2012 was $29.0 million compared to favorable development of $34.7 million during 2011. Notwithstanding the increase in losses and LAE, there was a modest increase in current accident year underwriting profit primarily due to the growth in earned premium and changes to our mix of business. The competitive nature of the Commercial Lines market requires us to be highly disciplined in our underwriting process to ensure that we write business at acceptable margins. Also, we continue to seek rate increases across our lines of business. Rate actions in our commercial automobile and workers compensation lines, and our property coverages in our commercial multiple peril line have been supported by industry wide loss trends and severity. In our surety business, we continue to shift the business mix toward commercial surety from contract surety, and to enhance the underwriting tools and standards that we employ. Personal Lines In our Personal Lines business, we focus on partnering with high quality, value-added agencies that deliver consultative selling and stress the importance of account rounding (the conversion of single policy customers to accounts with multiple policies and additional coverages). Approximately 70% of our policies in force are account business. We are focused on making investments that help maintain profitability, build a distinctive position in the market, help diversify us geographically from our historical core states of Michigan, Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey, and provide us with profitable growth opportunities. Written premium in Personal Lines increased slightly during 2012. Underwriting results improved modestly in 2012, as compared to 2011, primarily due to decreased catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses, partially offset by unfavorable development on prior years loss reserves. Unfavorable development on prior years loss reserves during 2012 was $26.5 million, compared to favorable development of $33.0 million during 2011. Similar to our strategy in Commercial Lines, we continue to seek additional rate increases, subject to regulatory considerations, in our personal automobile line, particularly as a result of recent trends of higher loss severity in bodily injury and personal injury protection claims and homeowners lines as a result of the catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses that the industry experienced in recent years. Chaucer In our Chaucer business, we deploy specialist underwriters in over 30 major insurance and reinsurance classes, including energy, marine and aviation, U.K. motor, property, and casualty and other coverages. We obtain business through Lloyd s, the leading international insurance and reinsurance market, which provides us with access to specialist business in over 200 countries and territories worldwide through its international licenses, brand reputation and strong security rating. Together, our underwriting strength, diverse portfolio and Lloyd membership underpin our ability to actively manage the scale, composition and profitable development of this business. In 2012, our Chaucer segment net written premiums were $990.5 million and net earned premiums were $966.8 million. We benefited from rate increases for several lines, particularly property, energy and marine, following recent high levels of insured market losses. Overall, 2012 underwriting results were favorable, generating $20.9 million of underwriting income, excluding prior years favorable loss reserve development, benefitting from lower loss activity in most lines and a relatively low level of man-made and natural catastrophe losses. After an encouraging year in our international insurance business, we expect moderating rate increases in 2013, with emerging underwriting opportunities limited to those marine and property markets most affected by Superstorm Sandy. U.K. motor rates decreased in 2012 and we expect this trend to continue in 2013 following significant increases in 2010 and 2011. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or increase our rates in light of economic and regulatory conditions in our markets. The focus of our capital and underwriting capabilities remains in those areas where we expect rates to be more favorable, in particular, for catastrophe-exposed marine and energy risks, with emphasis away from business where rates are currently under pressure, notably casualty and aviation. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATING SEGMENTS Primary business operations include insurance products and services currently provided through four operating segments. These operating segments are Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, Chaucer and Other Property and Casualty. Commercial Lines includes commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, workers compensation and other commercial coverages, such as specialty program business, inland marine, management and professional liability and surety. Personal Lines includes personal automobile, homeowners and other personal coverages. Chaucer includes marine and aviation, energy, property, U.K. motor, and casualty and other coverages (which includes interna- 42 Table of Contents tional liability, specialist coverages, and syndicate participations). The Other Property and Casualty segment consists of Opus Investment Management, Inc., which markets investment management services to institutions, pension funds and other organizations; earnings on holding company assets; and, a voluntary pools business which is in run-off. We present the separate financial information of each segment consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates results in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. We report interest expense related to our debt separately from the earnings of our operating segments. This consists of interest on our senior debentures, junior debentures, subordinated notes, collateralized borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston ( FHLBB ), and letter of credit facility. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NET INCOME Consolidated net income includes the results of our four operating segments (segment income), which we evaluate on a pre-tax basis and we exclude interest expense on debt. Segment income excludes certain other items which we believe are not indicative of our core operations, such as income taxes and net realized investment gains and losses, including net gains and losses on certain derivative instruments. Such gains and losses are excluded since they are determined by interest rates, financial markets and the timing of sales. Also, segment income excludes net gains and losses on disposals of businesses, discontinued operations, costs to acquire businesses, restructuring costs, extraordinary items, the cumulative effect of accounting changes and certain other items. Although the items excluded from segment income may be significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance, we believe a discussion of segment income enhances an investor understanding of our results of operations by segregating income attributable to the core operations of the business. However, segment income should not be construed as a substitute for net income. Catastrophe losses and prior years reserve development are significant components in understanding and assessing the financial performance of our business. Management reviews and evaluates catastrophes and prior years reserve development separately from the other components of earnings. Catastrophes and prior years reserve development are not predictable as to timing or the amount that will affect the results of our operations and have affected our results in the past few years. Management believes that providing certain financial metrics and trends excluding the effects of catastrophes and prior years reserve development helps investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings and to evaluate the underlying performance of our operations. 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 Consolidated net income was $55.9 million in 2012, compared to $36.7 million in 2011. The $19.2 million increase is primarily due to income from our Chaucer segment and lower costs in 2012 related to the Chaucer acquisition. Additionally, we recognized a $10.8 million gain from the sale of our third party administrator, Citizens Management, Inc. ( CMI ), which was completed on April 30, 2012 (see also Discontinued Operations ). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in segment results in our domestic operations. 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 Consolidated net income was $36.7 million in 2011, compared to $151.2 million in 2010. The $114.5 million decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in segment results in our domestic operations, partially offset by income from our Chaucer segment. Additionally, in the year ended December 31, 2011, advisory, legal, and accounting costs associated with the acquisition of Chaucer and other acquisition expenses totaled $16.4 million. We also recorded an $11.3 million loss in connection with a foreign exchange contract entered into in connection with the acquisition of Chaucer, which was partially offset by net foreign exchange gains of $6.7 million. The following table reflects segment income and a reconciliation of total segment income to consolidated net income.

The segment results are presented before interest expense, taxes and other items which management believes are not indicative of our core operations, including realized gains and losses. The following table summarizes the results of operations for the periods indicated: FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31 2012 2011 2010 (in millions) Segment revenues Net premiums written $ 4,368.4 $ 3,593.4 $ 3,048.0 Net premiums earned 4,239.1 3,598.6 2,841.0 Net investment income 276.3 258.2 247.2 Other income 58.2 51.9 38.9 Total segment revenues 4,573.6 3,908.7 3,127.1 Losses and operating expenses Losses and LAE 2,974.4 2,550.8 1,856.3 Policy acquisition expenses 938.1 778.9 600.8 Other operating expenses 586.0 507.2 447.8 Total losses and operating expenses 4,498.5 3,836.9 2,904.9 Segment income before interest expense and income taxes $ 75.1 $ 71.8 $ 222.2 2012 Compared to 2011 Segment income was $75.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $71.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase in earnings of $3.3 million. This increase is primarily due to a $103.9 million increase in Chaucer segment income, reflecting a full year of earnings for Chaucer compared to only six months in 2011 and lower loss activity in most Chaucer product classes, partially offset by a $96.6 million decrease in Commercial Lines earnings. The Commercial Lines earnings decrease was primarily due to unfavorable development on prior years loss and loss adjustment expense ( LAE ) reserves ( prior years loss reserves ) and increased catastrophe losses. Our consolidated catastrophe related activity for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $369.9 million, compared to $361.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $8.3 million. Both our 2012 and 2011 results reflected significantly elevated levels of catastrophe losses compared to our historical averages. Catastrophe losses in 2012 were primarily the result of $198.1 million of pre-tax losses related to Superstorm Sandy during the fourth quarter, and from several tornadoes during the first six months of the year. Our 2011 catastrophe losses resulted principally from winter storms, tornado, hail and windstorm activity in the first half of the year, and from Hurricane Irene and floods in Thailand and Denmark during the second half of the year. Favorable development on prior years loss reserves was $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $103.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $87.5 million. For 2012, $72.6 million of favorable development related to our Chaucer segment was partially offset by $56.8 million of unfavorable development related to our domestic operations. For the year ended December 31, 2011, $67.8 million of favorable development was related to our domestic operations and $35.5 million was related to our Chaucer segment. Net premiums written grew by $775.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, and net premiums earned grew by $640.5 million, in each case primarily as a result of including a full year of Chaucer net premiums in 2012 compared to only six months in 2011. Chaucer accounted for $561.7 million of the net premiums written increase and $460.5 million of the net premiums earned increase. The balance of the growth is primarily attributable to Commercial Lines, resulting from rate increases, strong retention and targeted new business expansion. 2011 Compared to 2010 Segment income was $71.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $222.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $150.4 million. Chaucer results in the second half of 2011 following its acquisition accounted for $32.9 million of segment income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Catastrophe related losses for our Commercial and Personal Lines businesses were $312.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $160.3 million for the same period in 2010, an increase of $151.8 million. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, earnings for our Commercial and Personal Lines businesses would have decreased by $31.5 million. This decrease was primarily due to higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses and LAE and lower favorable development on prior years loss and LAE reserves, partially offset by growth in earned premium and the resulting positive effect on our expense ratio and what we believe is an underlying improvement in our mix of business. Favorable development on prior years loss and LAE reserves for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $67.8 million compared to $111.1 million in the prior year, a decrease of $43.3 million. Net premiums written grew by $545.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, and net premiums earned grew 44 Table of Contents by $757.6 million. Chaucer accounted for $428.8 million of net premiums written and $506.3 million of net premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2011. The balance of the growth in net premiums written is attributable to Commercial Lines. A significant portion of the increase in net premiums earned in Commercial Lines is a result of the growth in net premiums written in 2010 following the OneBeacon renewal rights transaction, as well as growth in our AIX program business and in various niche and segmented businesses. PRODUCTION AND UNDERWRITING RESULTS The following table summarizes net premiums written and loss, LAE, expense and combined ratios for the Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Chaucer segments. Results for Chaucer Holdings plc include activity since the July 1, 2011 acquisition date. Loss and LAE, catastrophe loss and combined ratios include prior year reserve development. These items are not meaningful for our Other Property and Casualty segment.

This $198.9 million increase was primarily driven by rate increases, strong retention, and targeted new business expansion, including growth in the AIX program business, which grew by approximately $69 million. These factors were partially offset by the effects of exposure management actions and business mix improvement initiatives. Commercial Lines underwriting loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $224.2 million, compared to $123.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, or $101.2 million of increased losses. This was primarily due to unfavorable development on prior years loss reserves and increased catastrophe related activity. Unfavorable development on prior years loss reserves for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $29.0 million, compared to favorable development of $34.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a change of $63.7 million. Included in these amounts are $26.5 million and $9.2 million, respectively, of unfavorable development in our surety line in 2012 and 2011. Catastrophe related activity for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $193.4 million, compared to $148.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $45.0 million. The impact of Superstorm Sandy was $124.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Commercial Lines current accident year underwriting loss, excluding catastrophes, was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This $7.5 million improvement was primarily due to growth in earned premium and the resulting positive effect on our expense ratio, partially offset by higher current accident year losses. There were higher non-catastrophe losses in our commercial automobile lines, including automobile coverages in our AIX program business, partially offset by lower non-catastrophe losses in our commercial multiple peril and inland marine lines. Pricing in Commercial Lines continues to improve. We believe that industry pricing is increasing due to recent weather-related losses, as well as to reduced investment income as a result of low interest rates, and other factors. We are continuing efforts to improve our underwriting results, including through increased rates; however, our ability to increase Commercial Lines net premiums written while maintaining or improving underwriting results may be affected by price competition and the current challenging economic environment. We also expect to continue our efforts to reduce our property exposures in certain geographic areas and classes of business, with a goal of improving our longer-term profitability and reducing earnings volatility. Also, in recent years, weather-related catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses have been in excess of longer term averages. We monitor these trends and consider them in our rate actions. Personal Lines Personal Lines net premiums written was $1,475.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $1,461.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $14.4 million. The factors contributing to this modest increase were higher rates in both our homeowners and personal automobile lines. These increases were partially offset by our continued property-focused exposure management actions. Our actions to reduce homeowners policy exposures, including increases in rate, have resulted in an increase in policy attrition. Net premiums written in the personal automobile line of business for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $922.7 million comparable to $910.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Growth in premiums resulting primarily from rate increases were partially offset by a decline in policies in force of 2.2%, primarily as a result of fewer policies in force in Michigan, Florida, New York, Connecticut and Oklahoma. Net premiums written in the homeowners line of business increased 0.6%, resulting primarily from rate increases, partially offset by a 3.7% decline in policies in force primarily attributable to fewer policies in force in Michigan, New York and New Jersey. These declines in both our personal automobile and homeowners lines are attributed to more selective portfolio management, including attrition resulting from rate increases we have implemented despite the competitive pricing environment. Personal Lines underwriting loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $67.3 million, compared to $72.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an improvement of $5.3 million. This was primarily due to decreased catastrophe related activity and non-catastrophe weather-related losses, partially offset by unfavorable development on prior years loss reserves. Catastrophe related activity for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $134.8 million, including Superstorm Sandy of $45.2 million, compared to $163.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $28.9 million. Unfavorable development on prior years loss reserves for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $26.5 million, compared to favorable development of $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a change of $59.5 million. The unfavorable development was primarily in the personal automobile bodily injury and personal injury protection coverages as we and the industry have experienced higher loss severity. 48 Table of Contents Personal Lines current accident year underwriting profit, excluding catastrophes, was $94.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $58.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This $35.9 million increase was primarily due to lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses in our homeowners line, partially offset by the aforementioned increase in liability and personal injury protection losses in the automobile line. Although we have been able to obtain rate increases in our Personal Lines markets and believe that our ability to obtain these increases will continue, our ability to maintain Personal Lines net written premium and to maintain and improve underwriting results may be affected by price competition, recent weather-related losses, our exposure management actions, recent loss trends in bodily injury and personal injury protection claims, and regulatory and legal developments. In several recent years, weather-related catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses have been in excess of longer term averages. We monitor these trends and consider them in our rate actions. Our rate and exposure management actions could adversely affect our ability to increase our policies in force and new business. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current level of production or maintain or increase rates. Chaucer Chaucer net premiums written was $990.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. By line of business, Chaucer net premiums written were comprised of 26.2% U.K. motor, 23.7% marine and aviation, 19.7% energy, 16.3% property, and 14.1% casualty and other lines. This mix of business was driven and supported by our specialist underwriting strategy which is focused on actively managing the premium portfolio and risk exposures. Additionally, net written premiums for Chaucer are expected to increase significantly in 2013 due to the non-renewal of the capital provision reinsurance treaty with Flagstone Re. During 2012, 12% of Syndicate 1084 gross written premium was ceded to Flagstone Re. See Reinsurance in Item 1 Business of this Form 10-K for additional information. Chaucer underwriting profit for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $93.5 million, $72.6 million of which is attributable to favorable development on prior years loss reserves. Catastrophe losses for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $41.7 million, principally due to Superstorm Sandy and the U.S. drought. Chaucer underwriting profit, excluding prior year loss development and catastrophes, was $62.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Underwriting expenses of $366.1 million represented 37.9% of earned premium. After a profitable year in our international insurance business, we expect moderating rate increases in 2013. Opportunities for rate increases will likely be limited to those marine and property markets most affected by Superstorm Sandy. Current pricing conditions for energy are flat, while aviation and liability markets continue to be affected by the challenging economic environment and over capacity. U.K. motor rates decreased modestly in 2012 and are expected to continue to decline in 2013, following significant increases in 2010 and 2011. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or increase our rates in light of economic and regulatory conditions in our markets. Other Property and Casualty Other Property and Casualty segment loss was $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The $6.4 million increased loss is primarily due to lower net investment income in our holding company. 2011 Compared to 2010 Commercial Lines Commercial Lines net premiums written was $1,703.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $1,584.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This $118.3 million increase was primarily driven by growth in our specialty businesses, particularly in our AIX program business, which accounted for $57.1 million of this growth. Also benefiting the overall growth comparison in net premiums written were modest rate increases. Commercial Lines underwriting loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $123.0 million, compared to $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase in losses of $97.6 million. This was due to higher weather-related losses and LAE, including catastrophes, and decreased favorable development on prior years loss and LAE reserves, partially offset by growth in earned premium and the resulting positive effect on our expense ratio. Catastrophe losses for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $148.4 million, primarily due to Hurricane Irene during the third quarter, significant tornado, hail and windstorm activity in the second quarter and winter storms in the first quarter, compared to $61.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $86.8 million. Favorable development on prior years loss and LAE reserves for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $34.7 million, compared to $61.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $26.8 million. Included in 2010 results was $7.5 million of favorable LAE development, principally related to a change in the cost factors used for establishing unallocated LAE reserves. Commercial Lines underwriting loss, excluding catastrophe and prior year loss and LAE reserve development, for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $9.3 million, compared to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This $16.0 million improvement resulted from growth in earned premium and the resulting positive effect on our expense ratio, and from what we 49 Table of Contents believe to be an improved mix of business. Partially offsetting the effect of this growth were higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses and LAE, and higher losses in our surety business. The higher level of earned premiums primarily resulted from our 2010 OneBeacon transaction, from growth in our AIX program business, and from other growth initiatives. Personal Lines Personal Lines net premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $1,461.2 million, compared to $1,462.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $1.7 million. The most significant factors contributing to this small decrease were actions we have taken to reduce our market concentration in Louisiana, and our continued focus on driving profit improvement in our core states through both rate increases and more selective portfolio management, resulting in lower new business activity. These decreases were partially offset by higher rates in both our personal automobile and homeowners lines, and by a net premiums written increase of 7.1% in our target growth states. Continued increases in premium are expected in our target growth states as we seek to improve profitability in those states and diversify from our core states. Net premiums written in the personal automobile line of business declined 2.6%, primarily as a result of fewer policies in force in Michigan, Massachusetts, New York and Florida. We attribute the decrease in policies in force to more selective portfolio management, and to rate increases we have implemented despite the competitive pricing environment. Net premiums written in the homeowners line of business increased 4.5%, resulting primarily from rate increases. Personal Lines underwriting loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $72.6 million, compared to a profit of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase in losses of $73.5 million is due to higher weather-related losses and LAE, including catastrophes, and to decreased favorable development on prior years loss and LAE reserves, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Catastrophe losses were $163.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, including significant winter storms, tornado, hail and windstorm activity in the first half of the year and Hurricane Irene during the third quarter, compared to $98.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $65.0 million. Favorable development on prior years loss and LAE reserves was $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $48.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $15.8 million. Included in 2010 results was $2.3 million of favorable LAE development, principally related to a change in the cost factors used for establishing unallocated LAE reserves. Personal Lines underwriting profit, excluding prior year loss and LAE reserve development and catastrophes, was $58.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $7.3 million. This increase in non-catastrophe current accident year results was primarily due to lower operating expenses and what we believe is an improved mix of business, partially offset by non-catastrophe weather-related losses. Chaucer Chaucer net premiums written was $428.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2011. By line of business, Chaucer net premiums written were comprised of 28.4% U.K. motor, 25.0% marine and aviation, 17.0% property, 15.6% energy and 14.0% casualty and other lines. This business mix reflects our specialist underwriting strategy and active management of our portfolio. Chaucer underwriting profit for the six months ended December 31, 2011 was $11.9 million. Catastrophe losses for the six months ended December 31, 2011 were $49.5 million, principally due to floods in Thailand and Denmark. Favorable development on prior years loss and LAE reserves for the six months ended December 31, 2011 was $35.5 million. Chaucer underwriting profit, excluding prior year loss and LAE development and catastrophes, was $25.9 million in the six months ended December 31, 2011. Underwriting expenses of $181.2 million represented 35.7% of earned premium. Other Property and Casualty Other Property and Casualty segment loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $0.5 million, compared to a profit of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The $4.0 million decrease is primarily due to lower net investment income and less favorable development in our run-off voluntary pools. RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES Overview of Loss Reserve Estimation Process We maintain reserves for our property and casualty products to provide for our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses (our loss reserves ) with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period. These reserves are estimates, taking into account past loss experience, modified for current trends, as well as prevailing economic, legal and social conditions. Loss reserves represent our largest liability. Management process for establishing loss reserves is a comprehensive process that involves input from multiple functions throughout our organization, including finance, actuarial, claims, legal, underwriting, distribution and busi- 50 Table of Contents ness operations management. The process incorporates facts currently known and the current, and in some cases, the anticipated, state of the law and coverage litigation. Based on information currently available, we believe that the aggregate loss reserves at December 31, 2012 were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred as of that date, including both those known to us and those yet to be reported. However, as described below, there are significant uncertainties inherent in the loss reserving process. Our estimate of the ultimate liability for losses that had occurred as of December 31, 2012 is expected to change in future periods as we obtain further information, and such changes could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our loss reserves include case estimates for claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported ( IBNR ) at the balance sheet date. They also include estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims, less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries. Our property and casualty loss reserves are not discounted to present value. Case reserves are established by our claim personnel individually on a claim by claim basis and based on information specific to the occurrence and terms of the underlying policy. For some classes of business, average case reserves are used initially. Case reserves are periodically reviewed and modified based on new or additional information pertaining to the claim. IBNR reserves are estimated by management and our reserving actuaries on an aggregate basis for each line of business or coverage for loss and loss expense liabilities not reflected within the case reserves. The sum of the case reserves and the IBNR reserves represents our estimate of total unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. We regularly review our loss reserves using a variety of industry accepted analytical techniques. We update the loss reserves as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and resolved and new information becomes available. Net changes in loss reserves are reflected in operating results in the period in which the reserves are changed. The IBNR reserve includes a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us, some of which may not yet be known to the insured, as well as a provision for future development on reported claims. IBNR represents a significant proportion of our total net loss reserves, particularly for long-tail liability classes. In fact, approximately 43% of our aggregate net loss reserves at December 31, 2012 were for IBNR losses and loss expenses. Critical Judgments and Key Assumptions We determine the amount of our loss reserves based on an estimation process that is very complex and uses information from both company specific and industry data, as well as general economic and other information. The estimation process is a combination of objective and subjective information, the blending of which requires significant professional judgment. There are various assumptions required, including future trends in frequency and severity of claims, operational changes in claim handling, and trends related to general economic and social conditions. Informed subjective estimates and judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserve estimation process. Given the inherent complexity of our loss reserve estimation process and the potential variability of the assumptions used, the actual emergence of losses will vary, perhaps substantially, from the estimate of losses included in our financial statements, particularly in those instances where settlements or other claim resolutions do not occur until well into the future. Our net loss reserves at December 31, 2012 were $4.1 billion. Therefore, a relatively small percentage change in the estimate of net loss reserves would have a material effect on our results of operations. There is greater inherent uncertainty in estimating insurance reserves for certain types of property and casualty insurance lines, particularly liability lines, where a longer period of time may elapse before a definitive determination of ultimate liability and losses may be made. In addition, the technological, judicial, regulatory and political climates involving these types of claims are continuously evolving. There is also greater uncertainty in establishing reserves with respect to business that is new to us, particularly new business which is generated with respect to newly introduced product lines, by newly appointed agents or in geographies in which we have less experience in conducting business, such as the program business written by our AIX subsidiary, Chaucer international liability lines, our professional liability specialty lines, and business written in the western part of the United States. In some of these cases, there is less historical experience or knowledge and less data upon which we can rely. A combination of business that is both new to us and has longer development periods, provides even greater uncertainty in estimating insurance reserves. Historically, we have limited the issuance of long-tailed other liability policies, including directors and officers ( D&O ) liability, errors and omissions ( E&O ) liability and medical professional liability. With the acquisition of Hanover Professionals in 2007, which writes lawyers professional E&O coverage, the acquisition of Campania in 51 Table of Contents 2010, which writes medical professional liability and product liability coverages, and the introduction of new specialty coverages, such as our other professional management liability products, we are increasing, and expect to continue to increase, our exposure to longer-tailed liability lines, including D&O coverages. The Chaucer business acquired in 2011 contains several international and U.S. liability lines, of which financial institution and professional liability, international liability and energy liability, contribute the most uncertainty. We regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and additional events occur which may impact the resolution of unsettled claims. Reserve adjustments are reflected in the results of operations as adjustments to losses and LAE. Often, these adjustments are recognized in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying policy was written and the loss event occurred. When these types of subsequent adjustments affect prior years, they are described separately as prior year reserve development . Such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results and may vary by line of business. As discussed below, estimated loss and LAE reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by $15.8 million, $103.3 million, and $111.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. However, we have experienced unfavorable development in prior years and there can be no assurance that current loss and LAE reserves will be sufficient. We regularly review our reserving techniques, our overall reserving position and our reinsurance. Based on (i) our review of historical data, legislative enactments, judicial decisions, legal developments in impositions of damages and policy coverage, political attitudes and trends in general economic conditions, (ii) our review of per claim information, (iii) our historical loss experience and that of the industry, (iv) the nature of policies written by us, and (v) our internal estimates of required reserves, we believe that adequate provision has been made for loss reserves. However, establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that current established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience. A significant change to the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. An increase or decrease in reserve estimates would result in a corresponding decrease or increase in financial results. For example, each one percentage point change in the aggregate loss and LAE ratio resulting from a change in reserve estimation is currently projected to have an approximate $42 million impact on segment income, based on 2012 full year premiums. The major causes of material uncertainty relating to ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses ( risk factors ) generally vary for each line of business, as well as for each separately analyzed component of the line of business. In some cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method and in others, they are implicit. For example, a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged. Actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions, resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently. Some risk factors affect multiple lines of business. Examples include changes in claim department practices, changes in settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions, court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants, and degree of claimant fraud. Additionally, there is also a higher degree of uncertainty due to growth in our newly acquired businesses, with respect to which we have less familiarity and, in some cases, limited historical claims experience. The extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a line of business. Individual risk factors are subject to interactions with other risk factors within line of business components. Thus, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves. Inflation generally increases the cost of losses covered by insurance contracts. The effect of inflation varies by product. Our property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and LAE and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses are known. Consequently, we attempt, in establishing rates and reserves, to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in the projection of ultimate costs. For example, we have experienced increasing medical and attendant care costs, including those associated with automobile personal injury protection claims, particularly in Michigan, as well as in our workers compensation line in most states. Also, the U.K. motor business written by Chaucer recently has experienced high levels of claims inflation and increases in potential fraud-type claims. These increases are reflected in our current reserve estimates, but continued increases could contribute to increased losses and LAE in the future. We are also defendants in various litigation matters, including putative class actions, which may claim punitive damages, bad faith or extra-contractual damages, legal fees and interest, or claim a broader scope of policy coverage or settlement and payment obligations than our interpretation. Resolution of these cases are often highly unpredictable and could involve material unanticipated damage awards. 52 Table of Contents Loss and LAE Reserves by Line of Business Reserving Process Overview Our loss reserves include amounts related to short-tail and long-tail classes of business. Tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the final settlement of the claim. The longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim (i.e. a longer tail), the more the ultimate settlement amount is likely to vary from our original estimate. Short-tail classes consist principally of automobile physical damage, homeowners property, commercial property and marine business. The Chaucer business, while having a longer-tail on average than our traditional U.S. business, contains a substantial book of U.K. motor property damage, worldwide property insurance and reinsurance business, including certain high excess property layers, marine property, aviation property and energy property business which has relatively short development patterns. For these property coverages, claims are generally reported and settled shortly after the loss occurs because the claims relate to tangible property and are more likely to be discovered shortly after the loss occurs, and property losses are often more easily valued. Consequently, the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is generally less complex. However, this is less true for our Chaucer reinsurance business and high excess property layers where there is often a longer period of time between the date a claim is incurred and the date the claim is reported compared with our direct insurance operations. Therefore, the risk of delayed recognition of loss reserve development is higher for our assumed reinsurance and high excess property layers than for our direct insurance lines. While we estimate that a majority of our written premium is in what we would characterize as shorter-tailed classes of business, most of our loss reserves relate to longer-tail liability classes of business. Long-tailed classes include commercial liability, automobile liability, workers compensation and other types of third party coverage. Chaucer business longer-tailed lines include aviation liability, marine liability, energy liability, nuclear liability, U.K. motor medical and liability, international liability, specialist liability, and financial institutions and professional liability. For many liability claims, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may elapse between the occurrence of the loss, the discovery and reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the claim. As a result, loss experience in the more recent accident years for long-tailed liability coverage has limited statistical credibility because a relatively small proportion of losses in these accident years (the calendar years in which losses are incurred) are reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses. Liability claims are also more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations, the legal environment and the risk and expense of protracted litigation. Consequently, the estimation of loss reserves for these coverages is more complex and typically subject to a higher degree of variability and uncertainty compared to short-tailed coverages. Most of our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools is long-tailed casualty reinsurance. Reserve estimates for this business are therefore subject to the variability caused by extended loss emergence periods. The estimation of loss reserves for this business is further complicated by delays between the time the claim is reported to the ceding insurer and when it is reported by the ceding insurer to the pool manager and then to us, and by our dependence on the quality and consistency of the loss reporting by the ceding company and actuarial estimates by the pool manager. A comprehensive review of loss reserves for each of the classes of business which we write is conducted regularly, generally quarterly. This review process takes into consideration a variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims. Where appropriate, the review includes a review of overall payment patterns and the emergence of paid and reported losses relative to expectations. The loss reserve estimation process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes. As part of this process, we use a variety of analytical methods that consider experience, trends and other relevant factors. IBNR reserves are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate cost of all claims that have been reported or expected to be reported in the future and then subtracting reported losses and loss expenses. Reported losses include cumulative paid losses and loss expenses plus case reserves. Within the comprehensive loss reserving process, standard actuarial methods which include: (1) loss development factor methods; (2) expected loss methods (Bornheutter-Ferguson); and (3) adjusted loss methods (Berquist-Sherman), are given due consideration. These methods are described below: Loss development factor methods generally assume that the losses yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss amount observed to date. Historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses by accident year can be predictive of the expected future patterns that are applied to current paid and reported losses to generate estimated ultimate losses by accident year. 53 Table of Contents Bornheutter-Ferguson methods utilize the product of the expected ultimate losses times the proportion of ultimate losses estimated to be unreported or unpaid to calculate IBNR. The expected ultimate losses are based upon current estimates of ultimate losses from prior accident years, adjusted to reflect expected earned premium, current rating, claims cost levels and changes in business mix. The expected losses, and corresponding loss ratios, are a critical component of Bornheutter-Ferguson methodologies and provide a general reasonability guide. Berquist-Sherman methods are used for estimating reserves in business lines where historical development patterns may be deemed less reliable for more recent accident years ultimate losses. Under these methods, patterns of historical paid or reported losses are first adjusted to reflect current payment settlement patterns and case reserve adequacy and then evaluated in the same manner as the loss development factor methods described above. When the adequacy of case reserves change, the Berquist-Sherman incurred method may be deemed more reliable than the reported loss development factor method. Likewise, when the settlement patterns change, the Berquist-Sherman paid method may be deemed more reliable than the paid loss development factor method. In addition to the methods described above, various tailored reserving methodologies are used for certain businesses. For example, for some low volume and high volatility classes of business, special reserving techniques are utilized that estimate IBNR by selecting the loss ratio that balances actual reported losses to expected reported losses as defined by the estimated underlying reporting pattern. Also, for some classes with long exposure periods (e.g. energy construction, engineering and political risks), earnings patterns plus an estimated reporting lag applied to the Bornheutter-Ferguson initial expected loss ratio are used to estimate IBNR. This is done in order to reflect the changing average exposure periods by policy year (and consequently accident year). In completing the loss reserve analysis, a variety of assumptions must be made for each line of business, coverage and accident year. Each estimation method has its own pattern, parameter and/or judgmental dependencies, with no estimation method being better than the others in all situations. The relative strengths and weaknesses of the various estimation methods, when applied to a particular class of business, can also change over time, depending on the underlying circumstances. In many cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the relevant class of business. The manner of application and the degree of reliance on a given method will vary by line of business and coverage, and by accident year based on an evaluation of the above dependencies and the potential volatility of the loss frequency and severity patterns. The estimation methods selected or given weight at a particular valuation date are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication for the loss reserves being evaluated. Selections incorporate input from claims personnel, pricing actuaries, and underwriting management on loss cost trends and other factors that could affect ultimate losses. For most classes of shorter-tailed business in our Commercial and Personal Lines segments, the emergence of paid and incurred losses generally exhibits a relatively stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next. Thus, for these classes, the loss development factor method is generally appropriate. For many of the classes of shorter-tailed business in our Chaucer segment, the emergence of paid and incurred losses may exhibit a relatively volatile pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next. In certain cases where there is a relatively low level of reliability placed on the available paid and incurred loss data, expected loss methods or adjusted loss methods are considered appropriate for the most recent accident year. For longer-tailed lines of business, applying the loss development factor method often requires even more judgment in selecting development factors, as well as more significant extrapolation. For those long-tailed lines of business with high frequency and relatively low per-loss severity (e.g., personal automobile liability), volatility will often be sufficiently modest for the loss development factor method to be given significant weight, even in the most recent accident years, but expected loss methods and adjusted loss methods are always considered and frequently utilized in the selection process. For those long-tailed lines of business with low frequency and high loss potential (e.g., commercial liability), anticipated loss experience is less predictable because of the small number of claims and erratic claim severity patterns. In these situations, the loss development factor methods may not produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses in the most recent accident years since many claims either have not yet been reported or are only in the early stages of the settlement process. Therefore, the loss reserve estimates for these accident years are based on methods less reliant on extrapolation, such as Bornheutter-Ferguson. Over time, as a greater number of claims are reported and the statistical credibility of loss experience increases, loss development factor methods or adjusted loss methods are given increasing weight. 54 Table of Contents Management endeavors to apply as much available data as practicable to estimate the loss reserve amount for each line of business, coverage and accident year, utilizing varying assumptions, projections and methods. The ultimate outcome is likely to fall within a range of potential outcomes around this loss reserve estimated amount. Our carried reserves for each line of business and coverage are determined based on this quarterly loss reserving process. In making the determination, we consider numerous quantitative and qualitative factors. Quantitative factors include changes in reserve estimates in the period, the maturity of the accident year, trends observed over the recent past, the level of volatility within a particular class of business, the estimated effects of reinsurance, including reinstatement premiums, general economic trends, and other factors. Qualitative factors may include legal and regulatory developments, changes in claim handling, recent entry into new markets or products, changes in underwriting practices, concerns that we do not have sufficient or quality historical reported and paid loss and LAE information with respect to a particular line or segment of our business, effects of the economy and political outlook, perceived anomalies in the historical results, evolving trends or other factors. In doing so, we must evaluate whether a change in the data represents credible actionable information or an anomaly. Such an assessment requires considerable judgment. Even if a change is determined to be apparent, it is not always possible to determine the extent of the change. As a result, there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be partially or fully reflected in the carried loss reserves. In general, changes are made more quickly to reserves for more mature accident years and less volatile classes of business. Reserving Process Uncertainties As stated above, numerous factors (both internal and external) contribute to the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing loss reserves, including changes in the rate of inflation for goods and services related to insured damages (e.g., medical care, home repairs, etc.), changes in the judicial interpretation of policy provisions, and settlement obligations, changes in the general attitude of juries in determining damage awards, legislative actions, changes in the extent of insured injuries, changes in the trend of expected frequency and/or severity of claims, changes in our book of business (e.g., change in mix due to new product offerings, new geographic areas, etc.), changes in our underwriting practices, and changes in claim handling procedures and/or systems. Regarding our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools, we are provided loss estimates by managers of each pool. We adopt reserve estimates for the pools that consider this information and other facts. In addition, we must consider the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as legal, judicial, social conditions, political risks, and economic conditions change. For example, claims which we consider closed may be re-opened as additional damages surface or new liability or damage theories are presented. These and other issues could have a negative effect on our loss reserves by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. As a result, the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience further complicate the already complex loss reserving process. As part of our loss reserving analysis, we consider the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process. Those factors that could materially affect our loss reserve estimates include loss development patterns and loss cost trends, reporting lags, rate and exposure level changes, the effects of changes in coverage and policy limits, business mix shifts, the effects of regulatory and legislative developments, the effects of changes in judicial interpretations, the effects of emerging claims and coverage issues and the effects of changes in claim handling practices. In making estimates of reserves, however, we do not necessarily make an explicit assumption for each of these factors. Moreover, all estimation methods do not utilize the same assumptions and typically no single method is determinative in the reserve analysis for a line of business and coverage. Consequently, changes in our loss reserve estimates generally are not the result of changes in any one assumption. Instead, the variability will be affected by the interplay of changes in numerous assumptions, many of which are implicit to the approaches used. For each line of business and coverage, we regularly adjust the assumptions and methods used in the estimation of loss reserves in response to our actual loss experience, as well as our judgments regarding changes in trends and/or emerging patterns. In those instances where we primarily utilize analyses of historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses, this may be reflected, for example, in the selection of revised loss development factors. In longer-tailed classes of business and for which loss experience is less predictable due to potential changes in judicial interpretations, potential legislative actions, the cost of litigation or determining liability and the ultimate loss, inflation and potential claims issues, this may be reflected in a judgmental change in our estimate of ultimate losses for particular accident years. 55 Table of Contents The Chaucer segment contains run-off business comprised of liability lines, notably financial institutions and professional liability business written by Lloyd Syndicate 4000. There is particular uncertainty around the reserve estimates in respect of business written in 2007 and 2008 which have been subject to claims arising out of the financial turmoil in that time period, particularly in the financial institutions book. These claims are unlikely to be settled for some time since they contain numerous coverage issues and in many cases involve class action lawsuits that are likely to take several years to resolve. We have utilized substantially all of our available reinsurance with respect to losses and LAE related to Syndicate 4000 business written in 2008. The future impact of the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process is impossible to predict. There is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves, particularly for long-tailed classes of business and classes of business that are more vulnerable to economic or political risks. We do not derive statistical loss distributions or confidence levels around our loss reserve estimate, and as a result, we do not establish reserve range estimates. Reserving Process for Catastrophe Events The estimation of claims and claims expense reserves for catastrophes also comprises estimates of losses from reported claims and IBNR, primarily for damage to property. In general, our estimates for catastrophe reserves are determined on an event basis by considering various sources of available information, including specific loss estimates reported to us based on claim adjuster inspections, overall industry loss estimates, and our internal data regarding exposures related to the geographical location of the event. However, depending on the nature of the catastrophe, the estimation process can be further complicated by other impediments. For example, for hurricanes and other severe wind storms, complications often include the inability of insureds to promptly report losses, delays in the ability of claims adjusting staff to inspect losses, difficulties in determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy (generally for damage caused by wind or wind driven rain) or are specifically excluded from coverage caused by flood, and challenges in estimating additional living expenses, assessing the impact of demand surge, exposure to mold damage, and the effects of numerous other considerations. Another example is the complication of estimating the cost of business interruption coverage on commercial lines policies. Estimates for catastrophes which occur at or near the end of a financial reporting period may be even less reliable since we will have less claims data available and little time to complete our estimation process. In such situations, we may adapt our practices to accommodate the circumstances. For events designated as catastrophes which affect our Commercial and Personal Lines business segments, we generally calculate IBNR reserves directly as a result of an estimated IBNR claim count and an estimated average claim amount for each event. Such an assessment involves a comprehensive analysis of the nature of the event, of policyholder exposures within the affected geographic area and of available claims intelligence. Depending on the nature of the event, available claims intelligence could include surveys of field claims associates within the affected geographic area, feedback from a catastrophe claims team sent into the area, as well as data on claims reported as of the financial statement date. In addition, loss emergence from similar historical events is compared to the estimated IBNR for our current catastrophe events to help assess the reasonableness of our estimates. For events designated as catastrophes which affect our Chaucer business segment, we initially calculate IBNR reserves using a ground up exposure by exposure analysis based on each cedant or insured. These are supported by broker supplied information, catastrophe modeling and industry event estimates. As more specific claim level data becomes available over time for each catastrophe event, these initial estimates are revised and updated by claim frequency and severity modeling as described above, as appropriate for each event. Reserving Sensitivity Analysis The following discussion presents disclosure related to possible variation in reserve estimates due to changes in key assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Many other assumptions may also lead to material reserve adjustments. If any such variations do occur, they would likely occur over a period of several years and therefore their impact on our results of operations would be recognized during the same period. It is important to note, however, that there is the potential for future variations greater than the amounts described below and for any such variations to be recognized in a single quarterly or annual period. No consideration has been given to potential correlation or lack of correlation among key assumptions or among lines of business and coverage as described below. As a result and because there are so many other factors which affect our reserve estimate, it would be inappropriate to take the amounts described below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility in total. While we believe these are reasonably likely scenarios, the reader should not consider the following sensitivity analysis as illustrative of a reserve range. 56 Table of Contents Personal and Commercial Automobile Bodily Injury reserves recorded for bodily injury on U.S. voluntary business were $469.8 million as of December 31, 2012. A key assumption for bodily injury is the inflation rate underlying the estimated reserve. A five point change (e.g. 4% changed to 9% or 1%) in the imbedded inflation would have changed estimated IBNR by approximately $51 million, either positive or negative, respectively, at December 31, 2012. Personal Automobile Personal Injury Protection Medical Payment reserves recorded for personal injury protection medical payment on U.S. voluntary business were $174.4 million as of December 31, 2012. A key assumption for this coverage is the inflation rate underlying the estimated reserve. Given the long reporting pattern for this line of business, an additional key assumption is the amount of additional development required to reach full maturity, thereby reflecting ultimate costs, as represented by the tail factor. A five point change in the imbedded inflation and a one point change to the tail factor assumption (e.g. 1.02 changed to 1.01 or 1.03) would have changed estimated IBNR by approximately $27 million, either positive or negative, at December 31, 2012. Workers Compensation reserves recorded for workers compensation on U.S. voluntary business were $327.1 million as of December 31, 2012. A key assumption for workers compensation is the inflation rate underlying the estimated reserve. Given the long reporting pattern for this line of business, an additional key assumption is the amount of additional development required to reach full maturity, thereby reflecting ultimate costs, as represented by the tail factor. A five point change in the imbedded inflation and a one point change to the tail factor assumption would have changed estimated IBNR by approximately $39 million, either positive or negative, at December 31, 2012. Monoline and Multi-Peril General Liability reserves recorded for general liability on U.S. voluntary business were $344.2 million as of December 31, 2012. A key assumption for general liability is the implied adequacy of the underlying case reserves. A ten point change in case adequacy (e.g. 10% deficiency changed to 0% or 20% deficiency) would have changed estimated IBNR by approximately $23 million, either positive or negative, at December 31, 2012. Specialty Programs reserves recorded (including allocated LAE) for the AIX Companies were $239.1 million as of December 31, 2012. A key assumption for specialty programs is the expected loss and allocated LAE ratio ( ELR ) underlying the actuarial reserve analysis. A ten point change to the ELR on AIX would have changed estimated IBNR by approximately $11 million at December 31, 2012. New classes of business reserves recorded for new classes of Chaucer business (primarily within energy, engineering and international liability lines) were $246.6 million as of December 31, 2012. An increase in the ultimate loss by 5%, 10%, and 15% in the 2010 and prior, 2011, and 2012 years of account, respectively, on these classes would have increased estimated IBNR by approximately $57 million at December 31, 2012. Syndicate 4000 reserves recorded for Syndicate 4000 were $272.4 million as of December 31, 2012. An increase in ultimate gross claims of 20% across all Chaucer Syndicate 4000 product classes, primarily crime and professional liability coverage for financial institutions, for year of accounts 2007 and 2008 and doubling the probabilities of a total indemnity loss for each and every assured with potential exposure (or claims notified) to the fraud relating to Bernard L. Madoff, would have increased estimated net IBNR by approximately $52 million at December 31, 2012. Catastrophe events a 20% increase in estimated gross ultimate claim deterioration for the 2011 Japan and New Zealand earthquakes and Thailand floods, would have reduced underwriting income by approximately $25 million, including reinstatement premiums. For Superstorm Sandy, a 20% increase on the gross incurred claims for Chaucer and an additional 20% lag in expected reporting patterns on the U.S. direct business, would have reduced underwriting income by $10 million including reinstatement premiums. 57 Table of Contents Carried Reserves and Reserve Rollforward The following table provides a reconciliation of the gross beginning and ending reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (results for Chaucer for the year ended December 31, 2011 reflect the period from July 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011). FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31 2012 2011 2010 (in millions) Gross loss and LAE reserves, beginning of year $ 5,760.3 $ 3,277.7 $ 3,153.9 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 1,931.8 1,115.5 1,060.2 Net loss and LAE reserves, beginning of year 3,828.5 2,162.2 2,093.7 Net incurred losses and LAE in respect of losses occurring in: Current year 2,990.2 2,654.1 1,967.4 Prior years (15.8 ) (103.3 ) (111.1 ) Total incurred losses and LAE 2,974.4 2,550.8 1,856.3 Net payments of losses and LAE in respect of losses occurring in: Current year 1,317.6 1,482.4 1,078.7 Prior years 1,396.5 1,010.3 738.6 Total payments 2,714.1 2,492.7 1,817.3 Purchase of Chaucer, net of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses of $669.6 1,631.0 Purchase of Campania 29.5 Effect of foreign exchange rate changes 33.9 (22.8 ) Net reserve for losses and LAE, end of year 4,122.7 3,828.5 2,162.2 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 2,074.3 1,931.8 1,115.5 Gross reserve for losses and LAE, end of year $ 6,197.0 $ 5,760.3 $ 3,277.7 The table below summarizes the gross reserve for losses and LAE by line of business. DECEMBER 31 2012 2011 2010 (in millions) Commercial multiple peril $ 629.7 $ 550.0 $ 470.4 Workers compensation 571.8 544.7 529.0 Commercial automobile 269.7 234.9 224.5 AIX 321.6 239.6 211.9 Other commercial 454.2 360.1 347.2 Total Commercial 2,247.0 1,929.3 1,783.0 Personal automobile 1,400.7 1,366.3 1,358.4 Homeowners and other 141.3 131.9 136.3 Total Personal 1,542.0 1,498.2 1,494.7 Total Chaucer 2,408.0 2,332.8 Total loss and LAE reserves $ 6,197.0 $ 5,760.3 $ 3,277.7 Other commercial lines are primarily comprised of our monoline general liability, umbrella, marine, professional liability, and healthcare lines. Included in the above table, in the Chaucer segment, are $272.4 million and $302.8 million of reserves related to Chaucer liabilities in Syndicate 4000, consisting of financial and professional liability lines written in 2008 and prior, as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Also included in the above table, primarily in other commercial lines, are $60.5 million, $59.8 million and $63.9 million of asbestos and environmental reserves as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Prior Year Development Loss and LAE reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by $15.8 million, $103.3 million and $111.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 2012 activity by segment includes favorable development of $72.6 million for Chaucer, partially offset by unfavorable development of $56.8 million in other segments, consisting of $29.0 million, $26.5 million and $1.3 million for Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Other Property and Casualty, respectively. The 2011 activity by segment consists of favorable development of $34.7 million, $33.0 million, and $0.1 million, for the full year for Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, and Other Property and Casualty, respectively, and $35.5 million for Chaucer for the six months ended December 31, 2011. The primary drivers of reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2012 were as follows: Favorable development of previously established reserves in Chaucer lines of business as follows: energy line, primarily in the 2008 through 2011 accident years, marine and aviation lines, primarily in the 2007 through 2011 accident years, within casualty lines, primarily in the 2010 and 2011 accident years, and property line, primarily in the 2009 through 2011 accident years. Favorable development within Commercial Lines was due to lower than expected losses within our commercial multiple peril line related to the 2008 through 2011 accident years. Within other commercial lines, higher than expected losses in our contract surety line due to the ongoing challenging macroeconomic environment for contractors, and to a lesser extent, our AIX program business primarily related to unexpected severity in commercial automobile liability, commercial multiple peril and general liability in a limited number of programs. 58 Table of Contents Within Personal Lines, higher than expected losses within our personal automobile line, primarily related to bodily injury severity in the 2010 and 2011 accident years, and higher than expected homeowners property losses from non-catastrophe weather related activity in the 2011 accident year. Higher than expected large losses within our commercial automobile line, primarily related to liability coverage in the 2011 accident year. The primary drivers for reserve development during the year ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: Lower than expected losses within our personal automobile line, primarily related to bodily injury coverage in the 2008 through 2010 accident years. Lower than expected losses within our commercial multiple peril line related to the 2007 through 2010 accident years. Lower than expected losses within our workers compensation line related to the 2007 through 2010 accident years. Lower than expected losses in Chaucer energy, property and U.K. motor lines, primarily related to the 2009 and 2010 accident years. Additionally, within other commercial lines, unfavorable development in our professional liability and surety lines were partially offset by favorable development in our healthcare and other commercial property lines. The primary drivers for reserve development during the year ended December 31, 2010 were as follows: Lower than expected losses within our personal automobile line across all coverages, primarily related to the 2009 accident year. Lower than expected losses within the workers compensation line, primarily related to the 2008 and 2009 accident years. Lower than expected losses within the commercial multiple peril line in liability coverages, primarily related to the 2007 through 2009 accident years. Within our other commercial lines, our commercial umbrella line related to the 2007 through 2009 accident years contributed to the favorable development, partially offset by unfavorable development in our surety line, primarily related to the 2009 accident year. In addition, the 2010 amount includes $9.8 million of favorable development resulting from a change in the cost factors used for establishing unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves. It is not possible to know whether the factors that affected loss reserves in the year ended December 31, 2012 will also occur in future periods. As discussed in detail in this Form 10-K, there are inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses and we encourage you to read this Form 10-K for more information about our reserving process and the judgments, uncertainties and risks associated therewith. Asbestos and Environmental Reserves Although we attempt to limit our exposures to asbestos and environmental damage liability through specific policy exclusions, we have been and may continue to be subject to claims related to these exposures. Ending loss and LAE reserves for all direct business written by our property and casualty companies related to asbestos and environmental damage liability were $9.8 million, $10.0 million and $10.1 million, net of reinsurance of $20.4 million, $18.7 million, and $19.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Activity for our asbestos and environmental reserves was not significant to our 2012, 2011 or 2010 financial results. In recent years, average asbestos and environmental payments have declined modestly. As a result of our historical direct underwriting mix of Commercial Lines policies toward smaller and middle market risks, past asbestos and environmental damage liability loss experience has remained minimal in relation to our total loss and LAE incurred experience. In addition, we have established gross loss and LAE reserves for assumed reinsurance pool business with asbestos and environmental damage liability of $30.3 million, $31.1 million and $33.9 million at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These reserves relate to pools in which we have terminated our participation; however, we continue to be subject to claims related to years in which we were a participant. Results of operations from these pools are included in our Other Property and Casualty segment. A significant part of our pool reserves relates to our participation in the Excess and Casualty Reinsurance Association ( ECRA ) voluntary pool from 1950 to 1982. In 1982, the pool was dissolved and since that time, the business has been in run-off. Our percentage of the total pool liabilities varied from 1% to 6% during these years. Our participation in this pool has resulted in average paid losses of approximately $2 million annually over the past ten years. We estimate our ultimate liability for asbestos, environmental and toxic tort liability claims, whether resulting from direct business, assumed reinsurance or pool business, based upon currently known facts, reasonable assumptions where the facts are not known, current law and methodologies currently available. Although these outstanding claims are not significant, their existence gives rise to uncertainty and are discussed because of the possibility that they may become significant. We believe that, notwithstanding the evolution of case law expanding 59 Table of Contents liability in asbestos and environmental claims, recorded reserves related to these claims are adequate. Nevertheless, the asbestos, environmental and toxic tort liability reserves could be revised, and any such revisions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular quarterly or annual period or on our financial position. REINSURANCE We maintain a reinsurance program designed to protect against large or unusual losses and LAE activity. We utilize a variety of reinsurance agreements that are intended to control our exposure to large property and casualty losses, stabilize earnings and protect capital resources, including facultative reinsurance, excess of loss reinsurance and catastrophe reinsurance. We determine the appropriate amount of reinsurance based upon our evaluation of the risks insured, exposure analyses prepared by consultants, our capital allocation models and on market conditions, including the availability and pricing of reinsurance. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our primary obligations to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to us. We believe that the terms of our reinsurance contracts are consistent with industry practice in that they contain standard terms and conditions with respect to lines of business covered, limit and retention, arbitration and occurrence. Based on an ongoing review of our reinsurers financial statements, reported financial strength ratings from rating agencies, and the analysis and guidance of our reinsurance advisors, we believe that our reinsurers are financially sound. Catastrophe reinsurance serves to protect us, as the ceding insurer, from significant losses arising from a single event such as snow, ice storm, windstorm, hail, hurricane, tornado, riot or other extraordinary events. Although we believe our catastrophe reinsurance program, including our retention and co-participation amounts for 2013, are appropriate given our surplus level and the current reinsurance pricing environment, there can be no assurance that our reinsurance program will provide coverage levels that will prove adequate should we experience losses from one significant or several large catastrophes during 2013. Additionally, as a result of the current economic environment, as well as, losses incurred by reinsurers in recent years, the availability and pricing of appropriate reinsurance programs may be adversely affected in future renewal periods. We may not be able to pass these costs on to policyholders in the form of higher premiums or assessments. See Reinsurance in Item 1 Business of this Form 10-K for further information on our reinsurance programs. INVESTMENTS INVESTMENT RESULTS Net investment income before taxes was $276.6 million, $258.2 million and $247.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in net investment income in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the acquisition of Chaucer on July 1, 2011 and its related assets and investment income. Also, the increase resulted from our investments in dividend-yielding equity securities, various higher yielding investment grade fixed maturities and the investment of cash balances into fixed maturities, partially offset by the impact of lower new money yields. The increase in net investment income in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to the acquisition of Chaucer and its related investment income, partially offset by the impact of lower new money yields on fixed maturities. Higher dividend income from equity securities and lower investment expenses also contributed to the increase in net investment income. Average pre-tax earned yields on fixed maturities were 4.26%, 4.84% and 5.46% for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We expect average investment yields to continue to decline as new money rates remain at near-historic lows. INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO We held cash and investment assets diversified across several asset classes, as follows: DECEMBER 31 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) Carrying Value % of Total Carrying Value Carrying Value % of Total Carrying Value Fixed maturities, at fair value $ 6,952.2 86.5% $ 6,284.7 83.3% Equity securities, at fair value 315.8 3.9 246.4 3.3 Cash and cash equivalents 564.8 7.0 820.4 10.9 Other investments 210.3 2.6 190.2 2.5 Total cash and investments $ 8,043.1 100.0% $ 7,541.7 100.0% CASH AND INVESTMENTS Total cash and investments increased $501.4 million, or 6.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2012, of which fixed maturities increased $667.5 million, equities increased $69.4 million, other investments increased $20.1 million and cash and cash equivalents decreased $255.6 million. Fixed maturities increased and cash and cash equivalents decreased primarily due to the investment of a substantial portion of Chaucer cash into fixed maturities. 60 Table of Contents We also invested cash generated from operations into fixed maturities. Equity securities increased primarily from additional purchases of exchange traded funds and mutual funds. Additionally, the value of fixed maturities and equi-ties increased as a result of market value appreciation. Our fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of corporate securities, taxable and tax-exempt municipal securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, foreign government securities, U.S. government securities and asset-backed securities. Equity securities primarily consist of common stocks, exchange traded funds, mutual funds and non-redeemable preferred stocks. The following table provides information about the investment types of our fixed maturities portfolio: DECEMBER 31 2012 (in millions) Investment Type Amortized Cost Fair Value Net Unrealized Gain Change in Net Unrealized for the Year U.S. Treasury and government agencies $ 317.2 $ 325.6 $ 8.4 $ 0.8 Foreign government 348.5 352.9 4.4 4.5 Municipals: Taxable 853.9 933.0 79.1 20.7 Tax exempt 156.3 163.3 7.0 1.9 Corporate 3,512.8 3,773.4 260.6 103.2 Asset-backed: Residential mortgage-backed 769.0 805.2 36.2 3.7 Commercial mortgage-backed 373.3 396.2 22.9 8.9 Asset-backed 198.5 202.6 4.1 3.0 Total fixed maturities $ 6,529.5 $ 6,952.2 $ 422.7 $ 146.7 During 2012, our net unrealized gains on fixed maturities increased $146.7 million, or 53.2%, to a net unrealized gain of $422.7 million at December 31, 2012, compared to $276.0 million at December 31, 2011. Amortized cost and fair value by rating category were as follows: DECEMBER 31 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) NAIC Designation Rating Agency Equivalent Designation Amortized Cost Fair Value % of Total Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value % of Total Fair Value 1 Aaa/Aa/A $ 4,744.0 $ 5,017.9 72.2% $ 4,325.1 $ 4,510.7 71.8% 2 Baa 1,443.5 1,569.3 22.6 1,338.7 1,419.7 22.6 3 Ba 143.1 156.2 2.2 151.2 160.0 2.5 4 B 135.1 143.5 2.1 134.5 136.4 2.2 5 Caa and lower 50.1 50.7 0.7 47.1 44.7 0.7 6 In or near default 13.7 14.6 0.2 12.1 13.2 0.2 Total fixed maturities $ 6,529.5 $ 6,952.2 100.0% $ 6,008.7 $ 6,284.7 100.0% Based on ratings by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ), approximately 95% of the fixed maturity portfolio consisted of investment grade securities at December 31, 2012, compared to 94% at December 31, 2011. The quality of our fixed maturity portfolio remains strong based on ratings, capital structure position, support through guarantees, underlying security, issuer diversification and yield curve position. We deposit funds with various state and governmental authorities as well as with Lloyd s. See Note 3 Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for additional information. Our fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Financial instruments whose value was determined using significant management judgment or estimation constituted less than 2% of the total assets we measured at fair value. (See also Note 5 Fair Value in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K). Other investments consisted primarily of overseas deposits, which are U.S. dollar and foreign denominated investments maintained in overseas funds and managed exclusively by Lloyd s. These funds are required in order to protect policyholders in overseas markets and enable our Chaucer segment to operate in those markets. Access to those funds is restricted and we have no control over the investment strategy. Also included in other investments were investments in limited partnerships, which were accounted for under the equity method of accounting or at cost. 61 Table of Contents Although we expect to invest new funds primarily in investment grade fixed maturities, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, a portion of funds in common equity securities and below investment grade fixed maturities and other assets. Municipal bond exposure Our municipal bond portfolio constituted approximately 14% of invested assets at December 31, 2012 and was 99% investment grade, without regard to insurance enhancements, which affected approximately 26% of the municipal bond portfolio. The portfolio was well diversified by geography, sector and source of payment, and consisted primarily of taxable securities. Approximately 61% of the portfolio was invested in revenue bonds and 39% in general obligation bonds. Revenue bonds are backed by the revenue stream generated by the services provided by the issuer, while general obligation bonds are backed by the authority that issued the debt and are secured by the taxing powers of those authorities. European sovereign and non-sovereign debt exposure Our European fixed maturity credit exposure at December 31, 2012 was as follows: Non-Sovereign (in millions) Sovereign Foreign Agency Financial Non-Financial Total Country: Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value United Kingdom $ 111.4 $ 111.9 $ $ $ 284.8 $ 290.9 $ 242.4 $ 256.5 $ 638.6 $ 659.3 Germany 63.1 64.0 74.5 79.1 137.6 143.1 Switzerland 20.4 21.0 79.4 86.3 99.8 107.3 The Netherlands 22.8 23.2 33.5 34.5 24.3 26.2 80.6 83.9 Supranationals 80.2 82.2 80.2 82.2 France 4.8 5.0 10.1 9.6 57.5 61.9 72.4 76.5 Sweden 23.9 25.0 13.0 13.4 36.9 38.4 Spain 9.5 9.8 17.9 19.2 27.4 29.0 Ireland 15.5 17.1 15.5 17.1 Belgium 16.1 16.8 16.1 16.8 Italy 16.3 16.7 16.3 16.7 Norway 3.4 3.5 2.7 2.7 5.4 5.5 11.5 11.7 Luxembourg 7.6 7.6 7.6 7.6 Portugal 4.2 4.4 4.2 4.4 Jersey 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 Denmark 2.1 2.2 2.1 2.2 Total fixed maturities $ 111.4 $ 111.9 $ 174.3 $ 177.9 $ 384.9 $ 393.5 $ 578.6 $ 615.3 $ 1,249.2 $ 1,298.6 Our sovereign debt totaled $111.9 million, or 1.4% of investment assets as of December 31, 2012, and was limited to the highly rated country of the U.K. We had no sovereign debt of lower rated countries such as Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. In addition, our supranational and foreign agency exposure totaled $177.9 million, or 2.2% of investment assets, and primarily consisted of debt securities from the highly rated countries of Germany and the Netherlands. Exposure to European banks, excluding those that are based in the U.K., totaled $102.6 million, or 1.3% of invest ment assets. Also, we held money market funds totaling $163.0 million, or 2.0% of investment assets, which were comprised of a well-diversified portfolio of short-term debt securities of predominately large financial institutions domiciled in highly rated countries. The remainder of our European non-sovereign debt exposure, excluding the U.K., was $358.8 million, which represented 4.5% of investment assets. Generally, these securities were high quality, large cap multi-national companies that were well diversified by sector, country and issuer. Included in our non-financial exposure were credits domiciled in Spain, Ireland, Italy and Portugal totaling $57.4 million, or 0.7% of investment assets. These consisted of large market capitalization issuers that provide essential products and/or services. 62 Table of Contents The previous table represents all European countries in which we had exposure. We determined country exposures based on the country of domicile for the ultimate parent company of the various issuers we held as of December 31, 2012; however, in light of the economic and financial inter-relatedness and dependencies that exist among European countries and related financial systems, economic turmoil in one country could trigger a contagion effect on other countries. We believe the quality of our European credit exposure remains sound based on ratings and issuer strength, position in the capital structure, support through guarantees and partial government ownership by highly rated countries, diversity and quality of non-financial issuers and blend of industry exposures, and yield curve position. We believe that we do not have meaningful indirect exposures in our portfolio and we do not invest in credit derivatives. We manage our country exposure using fundamental analysis coupled with relative value considerations. Investment decisions are based on the combination of a top-down macroeconomic perspective and bottom-up credit security analysis. We monitor political and economic developments; progress toward attainment of growth and budget targets; developments related to policy, reform and regulatory initiatives from European officials; progress toward funding objectives, including the availability and cost of funding; outlook for credit ratings; ability of banks to meet increased regulatory capital standards, operate in a weakened macroeconomic environment, and maintain adequate liquidity and sufficient access to capital to meet funding requirements; and contagion throughout the financial system as evidenced by increased costs for interbank funding, lower prices for stocks and corporate bonds, as well as the availability of capital. We actively manage our credit exposure and seek securities with the best combination of credit strength and valuation. As we invest new capital, we consider expectations for the strength and duration of economic recovery, risks associated with the European debt crisis and the possibility of additional volatility based on these challenges. Accordingly, we focus on providers of essential services or products best positioned to navigate the period of weak growth; industrials with greater international exposure, either locally or via exports, particularly to the developing world, which we view more favorably based on higher growth assumptions for emerging market economies; and financial institutions best positioned regarding asset quality, liquidity and capital adequacy. Overall economic growth remains weak throughout Europe. Volatility, while currently suppressed, could increase suddenly as officials in Europe attempt to engineer a lasting solution to the debt crisis or find a way to address the twin objectives of stimulating economic growth while balancing fiscal budgets. We believe that leaders remain committed to protecting the currency union and improving financial stability. Although the timing and degree of success toward achieving sustained improvement regarding the European crisis remains highly uncertain, we do not anticipate that future developments related to our European sovereign and non-sovereign debt exposure will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operation or liquidity. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS For the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized in earnings $7.8 million of other-than-temporary impairments ( OTTI ), of which $6.6 million related to fixed maturities and $1.2 million related to equity securities. OTTI on debt securities consisted of $4.6 million of below investment grade corporate bonds in the utilities and industrial sectors that we intended to sell and $2.0 million related to estimated credit losses, consisting of $0.9 million on municipal bonds, $0.7 million on residential mortgage-backed securities and $0.4 million on corporate bonds. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized in earnings $6.9 million of OTTI on fixed maturity and equity securities. OTTI on debt securities was $5.5 million, primarily on below investment grade corporate and municipal bonds that we intended to sell. Additionally, we recognized OTTI of $0.9 million related to estimated credit losses on residential mortgage-backed securities. We also recognized OTTI on a common stock of $1.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $13.9 million of OTTI on fixed maturities, certain low-income housing tax credit limited partnerships ( LIHTC ) and equity securities in earnings, of which $4.4 million related to LIHTC partnerships, $4.3 million was estimated credit losses on debt securities, $3.3 million related to debt securities classified as intend to sell and $1.9 million related to common stocks. 63 Table of Contents UNREALIZED LOSSES The following table provides information about our fixed maturities and equity securities that were in an unrealized loss position. (See also Note 3 Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K). DECEMBER 31 2012 2011 (in millions) Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Fixed maturities: Investment grade: 12 months or less $ 3.4 $ 546.0 $ 27.1 $ 1,175.5 Greater than 12 months 9.5 106.5 14.3 108.9 Total investment grade fixed maturities 12.9 652.5 41.4 1,284.4 Below investment grade: 12 months or less 1.2 28.2 9.9 126.9 Greater than 12 months 5.9 55.1 3.7 14.7 Total below investment grade fixed maturities 7.1 83.3 13.6 141.6 Equity securities: 12 months or less 4.8 74.4 8.8 87.2 Total equity securities 4.8 74.4 8.8 87.2 Total $ 24.8 $ 810.2 $ 63.8 $ 1,513.2 Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities decreased $39.0 million, or 61.1%, which was primarily attributable to lower interest rates and tightening of credit and liquidity spreads across all sectors. At December 31, 2012, gross unrealized losses consist primarily of $14.8 million of corporate fixed maturities, $4.8 million of equity securities, $3.5 million of mortgage-backed securities and $1.1 million in municipal securities. We view the gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities as being temporary since it is our assessment that these securities will recover in the near term, allowing us to realize their anticipated long-term economic value. With respect to gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities, we do not intend to sell, nor is it more likely than not we will be required to sell, such debt securities before this expected recovery of amortized cost (See also Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K). With respect to equity securities, we have the intent and ability to retain such investments for the period of time anticipated to allow for this expected recovery in fair value. The risks inherent in our assessment methodology include the risk that, subsequent to the balance sheet date, market factors may differ from our expectations; the global economic recovery is less robust than we expect or reverts to recessionary trends; we may decide to subsequently sell a security for unforeseen business needs; or changes in the credit assessment or equity characteristics from our original assessment may lead us to determine that a sale at the current value would maximize recovery on such investments. To the extent that there are such adverse changes, an OTTI would be recognized as a realized loss. Although unrealized losses are not reflected in the results of financial operations until they are realized or deemed other-than-temporary , the fair value of the underlying investment, which does reflect the unrealized loss, is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table sets forth gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities by maturity period and for equity securities at December 31, 2012 and 2011. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations, with or without call or prepayment penalties, or we may have the right to put or sell the obligations back to the issuers. DECEMBER 31 2012 2011 (in millions) Due in one year or less $ 0.5 $ 1.9 Due after one year through five years 4.7 18.9 Due after five years through ten years 2.5 11.2 Due after ten years 8.8 12.9 16.5 44.9 Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities 3.5 10.1 Total fixed maturities 20.0 55.0 Equity securities 4.8 8.8 Total fixed maturities and equity securities $ 24.8 $ 63.8 64 Table of Contents The carrying values of defaulted fixed maturity securities on non-accrual status at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were not material. The effects of non-accruals compared with amounts that would have been recognized in accordance with the original terms of the fixed maturities, were reductions in net investment income of $2.5 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Any defaults in the fixed maturities portfolio in future periods may negatively affect investment income. Our investment portfolio and shareholders equity can be significantly impacted by changes in market values of our securities. As the U.S. and global financial markets and economies have not fully stabilized, market volatility could increase and defaults on fixed income securities could occur. As a result, we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and/or financial position. Monetary policies in the developed economies, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, are supportive of moderate economic growth, while fiscal policies are more divergent and subject to change. The removal or modification of these policies could have an adverse effect on issuers level of business activity or liquidity, increasing the probability of future defaults. While we may experience defaults on fixed income securities, particularly with respect to non-investment grade securities, it is difficult to foresee which issuers, industries or markets will be affected. As a result, the value of our fixed maturity portfolio could change rapidly in ways we cannot currently anticipate and we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS We maintain an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments, as necessary, to manage significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by foreign currency and interest rate volatility. In 2012, we realized a loss of $5.1 million on futures contracts relating to the release of tax capital loss carryforwards. Additionally, we recognized a gain of $0.7 million on a foreign currency forward used to mitigate changes in fair value caused by foreign currency fluctuation in converting U.K. pound sterling ( GBP ) denominated securities into their U.S. dollar denominated equivalent. In April 2011, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract to hedge the foreign currency exchange risk embedded in the purchase price of Chaucer, which was denominated in GBP. This contract had a notional amount of 297.9 million and was settled on July 14, 2011, resulting in the recognition of a loss of $11.3 million in income from continuing operations. The loss on the contract was due to a decrease in the exchange rate between the GBP and the U.S. dollar, but was more than offset by the lower U.S. dollars required to meet the GBP-based purchase price. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for additional information. In May 2011, we entered into a treasury lock forward agreement to hedge the interest rate risk associated with our planned issuance of senior debt, which was completed on June 17, 2011. This hedge matured in June 2011 and resulted in a loss of $1.9 million, which was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized in earnings over the term of the senior notes. Additionally in 2011, Chaucer held foreign currency forward contracts utilized to mitigate changes in fair value caused by foreign currency fluctuation in converting the fair value of GBP and Euro denominated investment portfolios into their U.S. dollar denominated equivalent. These portfolios supported U.S. dollar denominated claim reserve liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized a gain of $6.1 million related to these instruments, which were terminated in October 2011. 65 Table of Contents OTHER ITEMS Net income also included the following items: (in millions) Commercial Lines Personal Lines Chaucer Other Property and Casualty Discontinued Operations Total 2012 Net realized investment gains $ 12.5 $ 7.1 $ 1.5 $ 2.5 $ $ 23.6 Net loss from retirement of debt (5.1 ) (5.1 ) Net costs related to acquired businesses (2.6 ) (2.6 ) Net foreign exchange losses (0.4 ) (0.4 ) Discontinued operations, net of taxes 9.8 9.8 2011 Net realized investment gains $ 4.7 $ 4.0 $ 6.7 $ 12.7 $ $ 28.1 Net gain (loss) from retirement of debt 0.3 (2.6) (2.3) Net costs related to acquired businesses (16.4) (16.4) Loss on derivative instruments (11.3) (11.3) Net foreign exchange gains 6.7 6.7 Discontinued operations, net of taxes 5.2 5.2 2010 Net realized investment gains (losses) $ 13.3 $ 17.8 $ $ (1.4) $ $ 29.7 Loss from retirement of debt (2.0) (2.0) Discontinued operations, net of taxes 1.6 1.6 We manage investment assets for our Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, and Other Property and Casualty segments based on the requirements of our U.S. combined property and casualty companies. We allocate the investment income, expenses and realized gains and losses to our Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Other Property and Casualty segments based on actuarial information related to the underlying businesses. We manage investment assets separately for our Chaucer segment. Net realized gains on investments were $23.6 million, $28.1 million, and $29.7 million for 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Net realized gains in 2012 were primarily due to $31.8 million of gains recognized from the sale of equities and fixed maturities, partially offset by $7.8 million of other-than-temporary impairments. Net realized gains in 2011 were primarily due to $27.7 million of gains recognized from the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities and $6.1 million of gains on foreign currency hedges, partially offset by $6.9 million of other-than-temporary impairments. Net realized gains in 2010 were due to $43.6 million of gains recognized, primarily from the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities, partially offset by $13.9 million of other-than-temporary impairments. In 2012, we repurchased $65.4 million of our subordinated unsecured notes related to Chaucer at a par value. These notes had a carrying value of $60.3 million, resulting in a net loss of $5.1 million on the repurchases. In addition, we repurchased $7.0 million of capital securities related to AIX Holdings, Inc. ( AIX ) at par value. In 2011, we repurchased in several transactions, $69.5 million of our Series B 8.207% Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures ( Junior Debentures ) at a cost of $72.1 million, resulting in a net loss of $2.6 million on the repurchases. In addition, we repurchased $8.0 million of capital securities related to AIX at a cost of $7.7 million, resulting in a gain of $0.3 million. The net loss on all debt repurchases in 2011 was $2.3 million. In 2010, we repurchased $36.5 million of these Junior Debentures at a cost of $38.5 million, resulting in a loss of $2.0 million on the repurchase. Acquisition costs were $2.6 million and $16.4 million for 2012 and 2011, respectively, and primarily consist of advisory, legal, and accounting costs associated with the acquisition of Chaucer on July 1, 2011. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. 66 Table of Contents QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY Operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations which may adversely impact the valuation of the investment portfolio. In a rising interest rate environment, the value of the fixed income sector, which comprises 87% of our investment portfolio, may decline as a result of decreases in the fair value of the securities. Our intent is to hold securities to maturity and recover the decline in valuation as prices accrete to par. However, our intent may change prior to maturity due to changes in the financial markets, our analysis of an issuer credit metrics and prospects, or as a result of changes in cash flow needs. Interest rate fluctuations may also reduce net investment income and as a result, profitability. The portfolio may realize lower yields and therefore lower net investment income on securities because the securities with prepayment and call features may prepay at a different rate than originally projected. In a declining interest rate environment, prepayments and calls may increase as issuers exercise their option to refinance at lower rates. The resulting funds would be reinvested at lower yields. In a rising interest rate environment, funds may not be available to invest at higher interest rates. The following table illustrates the estimated impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2012 of hypothetical changes in prevailing interest rates, defined as changes in interest rates on U.S. Treasury debt. It does not reflect changes in credit spreads, liquidity spreads and other factors that affect the value of securities. Since changes in prevailing interest rates are often accompanied by changes in these other factors, the reader should not assume that an actual change in interest rates would result in the values illustrated. INVESTMENT TYPE +300bp +200bp +100bp 0 -100bp -200bp -300bp (Dollars in millions) Residential mortgage-backed securities $ 730 $ 755 $ 780 $ 805 $ 820 $ 825 $ 825 Municipal securities 900 955 1,025 1,095 1,165 1,215 1,230 All other fixed income securities 4,515 4,685 4,865 5,050 5,195 5,245 5,255 Total $ 6,145 $ 6,395 $ 6,670 $ 6,950 $ 7,180 $ 7,285 $ 7,310 Our overall investment strategy is intended to balance investment income with credit and duration risk while maintaining sufficient liquidity and the opportunity for capital growth. The asset allocation process takes into consideration the types of business written, the level of surplus required to support our different businesses and the risk return profiles of the underlying asset classes. We look to balance the goals of capital preservation, net investment income stability, liquidity and total return. The majority of our assets are invested in the fixed income markets. Through fundamental research and credit analysis with a focus on value investing, our investment professionals seek to identify a portfolio of stable income-producing higher quality U.S. government, foreign government, municipal, corporate, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. We have a general policy of diversifying investments both within and across major investment and industrial sectors to mitigate credit and interest rate risk. We monitor the credit quality of our investments and our exposure to individual markets, borrowers, industries, sectors and, in the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities, property types and geographic locations. In addition, we currently carry debt which is subject to interest rate risk, which was issued at fixed interest rates between 5.50% and 8.207%. Current market conditions do not allow for us to invest assets at similar rates of return; therefore, earnings on a similar level of assets are not sufficient to cover current debt interest costs. The following tables for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 provide information about financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturities. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties, or we may have the right to put or sell the obligations back to the issuers. Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are included in the category representing their expected maturity. Available-for-sale securities include both U.S. and foreign-denominated fixed maturities. Additionally, we have assumed available-for-sale securities are similar enough to aggregate those securities for presentation purposes. Specifically, variable rate available-for-sale securities comprise an immaterial portion of the portfolio and do not have a significant impact on weighted-average interest rates. Therefore, the variable rate investments are not presented separately; instead they are included in the tables at their current interest rate. Debt is presented at contractual maturities, except for the FHLBB community development advances ( CDAs ) which were repaid in January 2013. 67 Table of Contents DECEMBER 31, 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Total Fair Value 12/31/12 (Dollars in millions) Rate Sensitive Assets: Available-for-sale securities $ 644.5 $ 726.1 $ 756.0 $ 711.5 $ 588.5 $ 2,785.2 $ 6,211.8 $ 6,952.2 Average interest rate 3.98% 4.14% 4.00% 4.65% 4.16% 4.45% 4.31% Rate Sensitive Liabilities: Debt $ 46.3 $ $ $ $ $ 803.1 $ 849.4 $ 995.2 Average interest rate 3.88% 6.84% 6.68% DECEMBER 31, 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Fair Value 12/31/11 (Dollars in millions) Rate Sensitive Assets: Available-for-sale securities $ 560.9 $ 623.1 $ 608.7 $ 534.0 $ 588.6 $ 2,873.3 $ 5,788.6 $ 6,285.1 Average interest rate 3.82% 4.20% 4.35% 4.71% 4.96% 5.11% 4.75% Rate Sensitive Liabilities: Debt $ 6.9 $ $ $ $ $ 904.2 $ 911.1 $ 1,014.9 Average interest rate 7.12% 6.53% 6.53% EQUITY PRICE RISK Our equity securities portfolio is exposed to equity price risk arising from potential volatility in equity market prices. Portfolio characteristics are analyzed regularly and price risk is actively managed through a variety of techniques. A hypothetical increase or decrease of 10% in the market price of our equity securities would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio of approximately $32 million at December 31, 2012 and approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK Our Chaucer segment has exposure to foreign currency risk, most notably in its insurance contracts and its invested assets. Some of its insurance contracts provide that ultimate losses may be payable in foreign currencies depending on the country of original loss. Foreign currency exchange rate risk exists to the extent that there is an increase in the exchange rate of the foreign currency in which losses are ultimately owed. Thus, our Chaucer segment attempts to manage its foreign currency risk by seeking to match its liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with cash and investments that are denominated in such currencies. We may also utilize foreign currency forward contracts as part of our investment strategy. The principal currency creating foreign exchange risk for us is the U.K. pound sterling, and to a lesser extent, the Euro and the Canadian dollar. A hypothetical 10% reduction in the value of foreign denominated investments would be expected to produce a loss in fair value of approximately $124 million and $128 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Discontinued operations primarily consist of our Discontinued Accident and Health Business and our Discontinued Third Party Administration Business, CMI. The Discontinued Accident and Health Business had no significant financial results that impacted 2012, 2011 or 2010. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily include the net gain on the sale of our third party administration subsidiary, CMI, which was completed on April 30, 2012. CMI provided third party workers compensation and disability program administration services (such as claims administration, loss prevention and medical cost containment and in-house excess workers compensation coverage) to public entities, self insured employers and group programs. CMI generated total revenues of $4.4 million during the four months ended April 30, 2012 and $12.5 million and $12.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Income before taxes totaled $0.7 million during the first four months of 2012, while contributing $2.0 million and $2.1 million during 2011 and 2010, respectively. Assets and shareholder equity transferred as part of this sale totaled $10.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively. This sale resulted in a net gain of $10.8 million after taxes and is included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2012. 68 Table of Contents INCOME TAXES We are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign countries in which we operate. We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return that includes the holding company and its U.S. subsidiaries. Generally, taxes are accrued at the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% for income from the U.S. operations. Our primary non-U.S. jurisdiction is the U.K. In July 2012, the U.K. statutory rate decreased from 26% to 24% effective April 1, 2012 and from 24% to 23% effective April 1, 2013. We accrue taxes on certain non-U.S. income that is subject to U.S. tax as a result of being owned by a U.S. shareholder at the U.S. tax rate. Foreign tax credits, where available, are utilized to offset U.S. tax as permitted. Certain of our non-U.S. income is not subject to U.S. tax until repatriated. Foreign taxes on this non-U.S. income are accrued at the local foreign rate and do not have an accrual for U.S. deferred taxes since these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested overseas. The benefit for income taxes from continuing operations was $17.4 million in 2012, compared to a benefit of $9.9 million and an expense of $56.0 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. These amounts resulted in consolidated effective federal tax rates of (60.6)%, (45.8)%, and 27.2% on pre-tax income for 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. These provisions reflect the decreases in our valuation allowance related to capital loss carryforwards of $7.7 million, $7.5 million, and $9.7 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. In addition, these provisions reflect benefits related to tax planning strategies implemented in prior years of $14.3 million, $9.7 million and $3.2 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Absent these benefits, the provision for income taxes for 2012, 2011, and 2010 would have been $4.6 million or 16.0%, $7.3 million or 33.8%, and $68.9 million or 33.5%, respectively. The decrease in 2012 effective tax rate is primarily due to higher income from foreign operations not subject to U.S. tax. Our income tax provision on segment income was a benefit of $1.9 million for 2012, compared to an expense of $2.6 million for 2011 and an expense of $59.3 million in 2010. These provisions resulted in effective tax rates for segment income of (14.4)%, 15.5% and 33.3% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The tax benefit in 2012 is primarily due to income from foreign operations not subject to U.S. tax and lower segment income. The decrease in expense for 2011 is primarily due to lower segment income. Included in our deferred tax net asset as of December 31, 2012 is an asset of $58.4 million related to U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and a deferred tax asset of $16.7 million related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards. Our pre-tax U.S. operating loss carryforward of $166.8 million will expire beginning in 2031. Our pre-tax foreign operating loss carryforwards of $70.7 million were generated in the U.K. and have no expiration date. It is our opinion that there will be sufficient future U.S. and U.K. taxable income to utilize these loss carryforwards. Our estimate of the gross amount and likely realization of loss carryforwards may change over time. Included in our deferred tax net asset as of December 31, 2012 are assets of $112.2 million related to alternative minimum tax ( AMT ) credit carryforwards and $14.6 million related to foreign tax credit carryforwards. We may utilize these credits to offset future taxable income. The result of their utilization will be a lower current tax rate offset by a higher deferred tax provision, and also lower cash expenditures for federal income taxes during the utilization period. There is no expiration on AMT credit carryforwards and our foreign tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in 2021. It is our opinion that there will be sufficient future U.S. and U.K. taxable income to utilize these tax credit carryforwards. Our estimate of the gross amount and likely realization of tax credit carryforwards may change over time. In June 2012, we completed a transaction which resulted in the realization, for tax purposes only, of unrealized gains in our investment portfolio of $69.6 million. This transaction enabled us to realize capital loss carryforwards to offset this gain, and resulted in the release of $24.4 million of the valuation allowance we held against the deferred tax asset related to these capital loss carryforwards. Of the total $24.4 million release, $0.3 million was recorded as an increase in continuing operations and $24.1 million is reflected as a benefit in accumulated other comprehensive income. This $24.1 million will be released into income from continuing operations, related to non-segment income, in future years, as the investment securities subject to these transactions are sold or mature. During 2012, we released $35.9 million of our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset held at the beginning of the year. The release of this valuation allowance resulted from the aforementioned transaction which utilized our capital loss carryforwards, unrealized appreciation in our investment portfolio, and net realized capital gains in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Accordingly, we recorded decreases in our valuation allowance of $25.3 million as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, $7.7 million as an adjustment to income tax expense from continuing operations, and $2.9 million in discontinued operations. In September 2011, we completed a transaction which resulted in the realization, for tax purposes only, of unrealized gains in our investment portfolio of $98.4 million. This transaction enabled us to realize capital loss carryforwards 69 Table of Contents to offset this gain, and resulted in the release of $29.0 million of the valuation allowance we held against the deferred tax asset related to these capital loss carryforwards. A release of $0.2 million was reflected in income from continuing operations and the remaining amount of $28.8 million was reflected as a benefit in accumulated other comprehensive income. During 2012, we recognized $1.4 million of the $28.8 million in income from continuing operations, related to non-segment income. The remaining amount will be released into income from continuing operations in future years, as the investment securities subject to these transactions are sold or mature. During 2011, we reduced the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset by $55.6 million, from $91.5 million to $35.9 million. There were four principal components to this reduction. First, we decreased the valuation allowance by $29.0 million as a result of the transactions described above which utilized our capital loss carryforwards. Second, we decreased the valuation allowance by $21.9 million on certain unrealized losses as a result of unrealized appreciation in our investment portfolio. This decrease was reflected as an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income. Third, as a result of $28.1 million in net realized gains during 2011, we decreased the valuation allowance by $7.5 million as an increase to income from continuing operations, since these gains utilized our capital loss carryforwards. Fourth, in the 2010 U.S. federal income tax return, we were able to utilize an additional $7.6 million of capital loss carryforwards that expired in 2010. As such, we increased the valuation allowance by $2.6 million with an equal and offsetting increase to the related deferred tax asset. The remaining increase of $0.2 million was attributable to other items reflected as expense from discontinued operations. In November 2011, we reached an agreement with the IRS on our 2005 to 2006 audit cycle, resulting in a tax benefit of $2.1 million recognized as income related to our discontinued operations. The benefit is primarily due to the concession of our separate account dividends received deduction issue by the IRS Appeals Division, which resulted in the reduction of our liability for this uncertain tax position. See Note 7 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for additional information. Also in April 2011, we received notification that an interest refund claim filed with the Internal Revenue Service in 2009 had been accepted, resulting in a tax benefit of $0.6 million recognized in discontinued operations. In January, July, September, and December 2010, we completed transactions which resulted in the realization, for tax purposes only, of unrealized gains in our investment portfolio of $98.4 million, $37.1 million, $31.1 million, and $120.8 million, respectively. These transactions enabled us to realize capital loss carryforwards to offset these gains, and resulted in the release of $66.2 million and $34.4 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, of the valuation allowance we held against the deferred tax asset related to these capital loss carryforwards. The total release of $100.6 million was accounted for as an increase in income from continuing operations of $3.2 million and $6.0 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, with the remaining $91.4 million reflected as a benefit in accumulated and other comprehensive income at December 31, 2010. During 2012 and 2011, we recognized $12.6 million and $9.5 million, respectively, of the $91.4 million in income from continuing operations, related to non-segment income. The remaining amount will be released into income from continuing operations in future years, as the investment securities subject to these transactions are sold or mature. In 2010, we reduced the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset by a total of $104.1 million, from $195.6 million to $91.5 million. There were four principal components to this reduction. First, we reduced the valuation allowance by $66.2 million as a result of the aforementioned transactions which utilized our capital loss carryforwards. Second, we increased the valuation allowance by $20.3 million for certain tax basis unrealized losses which we did not believe we could utilize. This increase was reflected as a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income. Third, $135.5 million of our capital loss carryforwards expired in 2010. As a result, we released the $47.4 million of the valuation allowance attributable to these expirations with an equal and offsetting reduction in the related deferred tax asset. Fourth, as a result of $29.7 million in net realized capital gains, we decreased our valuation allowance by $9.7 million as an increase to income from continuing operations since these gains utilized our capital loss carryforwards. The remaining $1.1 million decrease was attributable to other items reflected as income from discontinued operations. In January 2010, we made a $100.0 million pension contribution, which resulted in both a current deduction of $35.0 million and the utilization (reduction) of a deferred tax asset of the same amount. This contribution is the most significant reason the current tax expense is $5.7 million in 2010, representing only approximately 10% of the total provision for federal income taxes from continuing operations. 70 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements. These statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following critical accounting estimates are those which we believe affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. Additional information about our other significant accounting policies and estimates may be found in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES See Segment Results Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K for a discussion of our critical accounting estimates for loss reserves. REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE BALANCES We share a significant amount of insurance risk of the primary underlying contracts with various insurance entities through the use of reinsurance contracts. As a result, when we experience loss events that are subject to a reinsurance contract, reinsurance recoveries are recorded. The amount of the reinsurance recoverable can vary based on the size of the individual loss or the aggregate amount of all losses in a particular line, book of business or an aggregate amount associated with a particular accident year. The valuation of losses recoverable depends on whether the underlying loss is a reported loss, or an incurred but not reported loss. For reported losses, we value reinsurance recoverables at the time the underlying loss is recognized, in accordance with contract terms. For incurred but not reported losses, we estimate the amount of reinsurance recoverable based on the terms of the reinsurance contracts and historical reinsurance recovery information and apply that information to the gross loss reserve estimates. The most significant assumption we use is the average size of the individual losses for those claims that have occurred but have not yet been recorded by us. The reinsurance recoverable is based on what we believe are reasonable estimates and is disclosed separately on the financial statements. However, the ultimate amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled. Reinsurance recoverables recorded on insurance losses ceded under reinsurance contracts are subject to judgments and uncertainties similar to those involved in estimating gross loss reserves, as disclosed above. In addition to these uncertainties, our reinsurance recoverables may prove uncollectible if the reinsurers are unable or unwilling to perform under the reinsurance contracts. In establishing our reinsurance allowance for amounts deemed uncollectible, we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentration of credit risk arising from our exposure to individual reinsurers. To determine if an allowance is necessary, we consider, among other factors, published financial information, reports from rating agencies, payment history, collateral held and our legal right to offset balances recoverable against balances we may owe. Our reinsurance allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to uncertainty and volatility due to the time lag involved in collecting amounts recoverable from reinsurers. Over the period of time that losses occur, reinsurers are billed and amounts are ultimately collected, economic conditions, as well as the operational and financial performance of particular reinsurers, may change and these changes may affect the reinsurers willingness and ability to meet their contractual obligation to us. It is also difficult to fully evaluate the impact of major catastrophic events on the financial stability of reinsurers, as well as the access to capital that reinsurers may have when such events occur. The ceding of insurance does not legally discharge us from our primary liability for the full amount of the policies, and we will be required to pay the loss and bear collection risk even if the reinsurers fail to meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS General We currently have a U.S. qualified defined benefit plan, a defined benefit pension plan for our international subsidiary, Chaucer, and several smaller qualified and non qualified benefit plans. In order to measure the liabilities and expense associated with these plans, we must make various estimates and key assumptions, including discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, employee turnover rates and anticipated mortality rates. Additionally, our Chaucer pension plan also must take into consideration inflation rates, specifically related to participant salary increases. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed at least annually and are based on our historical experience, as well as current facts and circumstances. In addition, we use outside actuaries to assist in measuring the expenses and liabilities associated with our defined benefit pension plans. 71 Table of Contents Two significant assumptions used in the determination of benefit plan obligations and expenses that are dependent on market factors, which have been subject to a greater level of volatility over the past few years, are the discount rate and the return on plan asset assumptions. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows as a present value on the measurement date. We also use this discount rate in the determination of our pre-tax pension expense or benefit. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. To determine the expected long-term return on plan assets, we generally consider historical mean returns by asset class for passive indexed strategies, as well as current and expected asset allocations, and adjust for certain factors that we believe will have an impact on future returns. Actual returns on plan assets in any given year seldom result in the achievement of the expected rate of return on assets. Actual returns on plan assets in excess of these expected returns will generally reduce our net actuarial losses (or increase actuarial gains) that are reflected in our accumulated other comprehensive income balance in shareholders equity, whereas actual returns on plan assets which are less than expected returns will generally increase our net actuarial losses (or decrease actuarial gains) that are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. These gains or losses are amortized into expense in future years. Expenses related to these plans are generally calculated based upon information available at the beginning of the plan year. Our pre-tax expense related to our defined benefit plans was $11.0 million and $13.0 million for 2012 and 2011, respectively. Expenses in 2012 include $1.8 million related to the Chaucer pension plan and expenses in 2011 include $0.4 million related to the Chaucer pension plan for the period of July 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011. U.S. Qualified Defined Benefit Plan Prior to 2005, we provided pension retirement benefits to substantially all of our U.S. employees based on a defined benefit cash balance formula. In addition to the cash balance allocation, certain transition group employees, who had met specified age and service requirements as of December 31, 1994, were eligible for a grandfathered benefit based primarily on the employees years of service and compensation during their highest five consecutive plan years of employment. As of January 1, 2005, the defined benefit pension plans were frozen. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we determined our discount rate utilizing an independent yield curve which provides for a portfolio of high quality bonds that are expected to match the cash flows of our pension plan. Bond information used in the yield curve included only those rated Aa or better as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and had been rated by at least two well-known rating agencies. At December 31, 2012, based upon our qualified plan liabilities and cash flows in relation to this discount curve, we decreased our discount rate to 4.25%, from 5.125% at December 31, 2011. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the expected rate of return on our qualified plan assets was 6.0% and 6.50%, respectively. The decrease reflects our strategy to shift investment assets from equity securities to fixed maturity investments over several years resulting in our composition of 84% fixed maturities and 16% equities at December 31, 2012, as well as declines in the fixed maturities markets in general. Actual returns of the plan investments generated approximately $57 million and $58 million of gains during 2012 and 2011, respectively, as compared to expected returns of approximately $33 million and $34 million, respectively. In 2012, actuarial losses of approximately $48 million primarily resulting from the decrease in the discount rate from the prior year were partially offset by the benefit from investment gains of approximately $24 million. The benefit from the investment gains experienced in 2011 was essentially offset by a decrease in the discount rate from the prior year. These net losses resulted in adjustments to our accumulated net actuarial losses in 2012 and 2011 of $23.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, which are reflected as decreases to our accumulated other comprehensive income. The change in these actuarial gains and losses is amortized into earnings in future years. The adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income from these actuarial losses occurring in 2012 and 2011 were offset by the amortization of actuarial losses from prior years of $10.8 million and $14.0 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Given the effect of our actual investment experience in 2012, and taking into consideration the decrease in discount rates in 2013, U.S. pension related expenses in 2013 are expected to increase slightly from 2012. Accordingly, we expect our pre-tax pension expense for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan to increase from approximately $6 million in 2012 to approximately $7 million in 2013. Holding all other assumptions constant, sensitivity to changes in our key assumptions related to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan are as follows: Discount Rate A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our pension expense in 2013 by $1.8 million and decrease our projected benefit obligation by $14.3 million. A 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase our pension expense by $1.8 million and increase our projected benefit obligation by $14.9 million. 72 Table of Contents Expected Return on Plan Assets A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would decrease or increase our pension expense in 2013 by $1.4 million. Chaucer Pension Plan Prior to 2002, our Chaucer segment provided defined benefit pension retirement benefits to certain of its employees. As of December 31, 2001, the defined benefit section of the pension plan was closed to new members. The defined benefit obligation for this plan is based on the employees years of service and final pensionable salary. As of December 31, 2012, we determined our discount rate utilizing an independent yield curve which provides for a portfolio of high quality bonds that are expected to match the cash flows of our Chaucer plan due to the longer duration of the plan liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, we determined our discount rate utilizing a 15 Year AA corporate bond index. At December 31, 2012, based upon our Chaucer plan liabilities and cash flows in relation to these yield curves, we decreased our discount rate to 4.80% from 4.90% at December 31, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2012 and the six months ended December 31, 2011, the expected rate of return on plan assets was 7.50% and 7.40%, respectively. The composition of our Chaucer plan assets are 77% equities, 14% fixed maturities, and 9% real estate funds at December 31, 2012. Actual returns of the plan investments generated approximately $10 million of gains and $5 million of losses during the year ended December 31, 2012 and the six months ended December 31, 2011, respectively as compared to expected returns of approximately $6 million and $3 million, respectively. The benefit from the investment gains experienced in 2012 was partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate from the prior year, resulting in net actuarial gains for the Chaucer plan of approximately $2.5 million. Investment losses experienced in 2011, combined with the decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by a decrease in the inflation rate and changes in other assumptions, resulted in net actuarial losses for the Chaucer plan of $14.1 million. These gains and losses are reflected as increases and decreases to our accumulated other comprehensive income, respectively. This balance is amortized into earnings in future periods. Given the effect of our actual investment experience in 2012, expected rates of return on investments in 2013 and taking into consideration the slight decrease in discount rates, pension related expenses for the Chaucer plan are expected to decrease in 2013 from $1.8 million to approximately $1.3 million (using the December 31, 2012 GBP to U.S. dollar conversion rate of 1.63). Holding all other assumptions constant (using the December 31, 2012 GBP to U.S. dollar conversion rate of 1.63), sensitivity to changes in our key assumptions related to our Chaucer pension plan are as follows: Discount Rate A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our pension expense in 2013 by $0.2 million and decrease our projected benefit obligation by $7.3 million. A 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase our pension expense by $1.5 million and increase our projected benefit obligation by $7.8 million. Expected Return on Plan Assets A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would decrease or increase our pension expense in 2013 by $0.2 million. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS We employ a systematic methodology to evaluate declines in fair values below amortized cost for all fixed maturity and equity security investments. The methodology utilizes a quantitative and qualitative process which seeks to ensure that available evidence concerning the declines in fair value below amortized cost is evaluated in a disciplined manner. In determining whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost is other-than-temporary, we evaluate several factors and circumstances, including the issuer overall financial condition; the issuer credit and financial strength ratings; the issuer financial performance, including earnings trends, dividend payments and asset quality; any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer; the general outlook for market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates; and the length of time and the degree to which the fair value of an issuer securities remains below our cost. With respect to fixed maturity investments, we consider factors that might raise doubt about the issuer ability to make contractual payments as they become due and whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. With respect to equity securities, we consider our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery in value. We monitor corporate fixed maturity securities with unrealized losses on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration as evidenced by ratings downgrades, unexpected price variances, and/or company or industry specific concerns. We apply consistent standards of credit analysis which includes determining whether the issuer is current on its contractual payments and we consider past events, current conditions and reasonable forecasts to evaluate whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. We utilize valuation declines as a potential indicator of credit deterioration and apply additional levels of scrutiny in our 73 Table of Contents analysis as the severity of the decline increases or duration persists. For our impairment review of asset-backed fixed maturity securities, we forecast our best estimate of the prospective future cash flows of the security to determine if we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Our analysis includes estimates of underlying collateral default rates based on historical and projected delinquency rates and estimates of the amount and timing of potential recovery. We consider available information relevant to the collectability of cash flows, including information about the payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, the financial condition of the underlying borrowers, collateral trustee reports, credit ratings analysis and other market data when developing our estimate of the expected cash flows. When an OTTI of a debt security occurs, and we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost of the security is reduced to its fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings, which reduces net income and earnings per share. If we do not intend to sell the fixed maturity investment or more likely than not will not be required to sell it, we separate the OTTI into the amount we estimate represents the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of the estimated loss attributable to credit is recognized in earnings, which reduces net income and earnings per share. The amount of the estimated OTTI that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. We estimate the amount of the OTTI that relates to credit by comparing the amortized cost of the debt security with the net present value of the debt security projected future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the investment prior to impairment. The non-credit portion of the impairment is equal to the difference between the fair value and the net present value of the debt security at the impairment measurement date. OTTIs of equity securities are recorded as realized losses, which reduce net income and earnings per share. The new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value. For equity method investments, we recognize an impairment when evidence demonstrates that a loss in value that is other-than-temporary has occurred. Evidence of a loss in value that is other-than-temporary may include the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or the inability of the investee to sustain a level of earnings that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. During each period, we evaluate whether an impairment indicator has occurred that may have a significant adverse affect on the carrying value of the investment. Impairment indicators may include: lower expectations of residual value from a limited partnership, reduced valuations of the investments held by limited partnerships, actual recent cash flows that are significantly less than expected cash flows or any other adverse events since the last financial statements received that might affect the value of the investee capital. OTTIs of equity method investments are recorded as realized losses, which reduce net income and earnings per share. Temporary declines in market value are recorded as unrealized losses, which do not affect net income and earnings per share, but reduce accumulated other comprehensive income, which is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We cannot provide assurance that the OTTIs will be adequate to cover future losses or that we will not have substantial additional impairments in the future. (See Investments in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding OTTIs and securities in an unrealized loss position). DEFERRED TAX ASSETS Our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and loss and tax credit carryforwards. These temporary differences are measured at the balance sheet date using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction. Consideration is given to available positive and negative evidence, including reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income in each tax jurisdiction, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. Valuation allowances are established if, based on the weight of available information, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions. Our judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and specific industry and investment market conditions. Changes in valuation allowances are generally reflected in federal income tax expense or as an adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss) depending on the nature of the item for which the valuation allowance is being recorded. 74 Table of Contents The following are the components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2012. There is no valuation allowance associated with our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2012. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (LIABILITIES) Gross Amount (in millions) Tax attributes Tax credit carryforwards $ 126.8 Operating loss carryforwards 75.1 201.9 Other Loss, LAE and unearned premium reserves, net 190.6 Deferred policy acquisition costs (115.8 ) Employee benefit plans 56.4 Investments, net (43.3 ) Software capitalization (31.4 ) Deferred Lloyd underwriting losses 13.5 Deferred foreign sourced income (8.0 ) Other, net 3.7 65.7 Total $ 267.6 We have $112.2 million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and $14.6 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards. The alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards have no expiration date and may be used to offset regular federal income taxes due from future income. The foreign tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in 2021. In addition, we have operating loss carryforwards that relate to current year U.S. net operating loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards from our Chaucer segment. The U.S. net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2031 and the Chaucer net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. Based on our projection of future economic conditions, taxable income, reversals of existing taxable temporary liabilities, and our strategic tax planning strategies, we believe that these tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards will be fully realized. We believe the remaining deferred tax asset from other temporary differences will be fully realizable based on our projected future taxable income and recent financial operations. Although we believe that these assets are fully recoverable, there can be no certainty that future events will not affect their recoverability. Future economic conditions and debt market volatility, including increases in interest rates, can adversely impact our tax planning strategies. STATUTORY SURPLUS OF U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES The following table reflects statutory surplus for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries: DECEMBER 31 2012 2011 (in millions) Total Statutory Capital and Surplus U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries $ 1,523.4 $ 1,582.8 The statutory capital and surplus for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries decreased $59.4 million during 2012, primarily due to underwriting losses primarily as a result of Superstorm Sandy. The NAIC prescribes an annual calculation regarding risk based capital ( RBC ). RBC ratios for regulatory purposes, as described in the glossary, are expressed as a percentage of the capital required to be above the Authorized Control Level (the Regulatory Scale ); however, in the insurance industry, RBC ratios are widely expressed as a percentage of the Company Action Level. The following table reflects the Company Action Level, the Authorized Control Level and RBC ratios for Hanover Insurance (which includes Citizens and other U.S. insurance subsidiaries), as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, expressed both on the Industry Scale (Total Adjusted Capital divided by the Company Action Level) and Regulatory Scale (Total Adjusted Capital divided by Authorized Control Level): (dollars in millions) D ECEMBER 31, 2012 Company Action Level Authorized Control Level RBC Ratio Industry Scale RBC Ratio Regulatory Scale The Hanover Insurance Company $ 657.6 $ 328.8 230% 460% D ECEMBER 31, 2011 The Hanover Insurance Company $ 581.9 $ 291.0 270% 540% LLOYD S CAPITAL REQUIREMENT Chaucer corporate members operate in the Lloyd market, which requires that these members deposit funds, referred to as Funds at Lloyd , to support their underwriting interests. Lloyd sets required capital annually for all participating syndicates based on each syndicate business plans, the rating and reserving environment, and discussions with regulatory and rating agencies. Although the minimum capital levels are set by Lloyd s, it is the responsibility of Chaucer to continually monitor the risk profiles of its managed syndicates to ensure that the level of funding remains appropriate. Such capital is comprised of 75 Table of Contents cash and cash equivalents, investments, undrawn letters of credit provided by various banks and other assets. At December 31, 2012, we are in compliance with the capital requirements. We have the following securities, assets and letters of credit pledged to Lloyd to satisfy these capital requirements at December 31, 2012. In 2012, the Company has decided not to renew its capital provision reinsurance treaty for the 2013 underwriting year with Flagstone Re. In accordance with the terms of the capital provision reinsurance treaty, Flagstone Re is obligated to provide funds at Lloyd in relation to its participation during the 2009 through 2012 underwriting years, until such time that these years close. Even without the reinsurance treaty, we expect to be able to meet these capital requirements in the future. (in millions) Letters of credit $ 180.0 Reinsurance treaty 94.9 Fixed maturities, at fair value 496.9 Cash and cash equivalents 3.4 Total securities, assets and letters of credit pledged to Lloyd $ 775.2 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity is a measure of our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of business operations. As a holding company, our primary ongoing source of cash is dividends from our insurance subsidiaries. However, dividend payments to us by our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to limitations imposed by regulators, such as prior notice periods and the requirement that dividends in excess of a specified percentage of statutory surplus or prior year statutory earnings receive prior approval (so called extraordinary dividends ). No dividends were paid to the holding company by Hanover Insurance in 2012. In 2011, a $99 million ordinary dividend was paid by Hanover. This dividend was used to help fund the acquisition of Chaucer. In 2010, a dividend of $75.0 million was paid by Hanover, providing cash and securities to the holding company. Dividend payments to the holding company by our Chaucer business are regulated by U.K. law. Dividends from Chaucer are dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries. Annual dividend payments from Chaucer are limited to retained earnings that are not restricted by capital and other requirements for business at Lloyd s. Also, Chaucer must provide advance notice to the U.K. Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) of certain proposed dividends or other payments from FSA regulated entities. In connection with an intercompany borrowing arrangement with the holding company, interest on a $300 million note is paid by Chaucer on a quarterly basis to the holding company. This interest approximates $5.5 million quarterly and may be deferred at the election of the holding company. If deferred, the interest is added to the principal. As of December 31, 2012, Chaucer has paid $27.4 million of interest to the holding company. At December 31, 2012, THG, as a holding company, held approximately $163.2 million of fixed maturities and cash. We believe our holding company assets are sufficient to meet our future obligations, which consists primarily of dividends to our shareholders (as and to the extent declared), the interest on our senior debentures, additional funds relating to the purchase of Chaucer, certain costs associated with benefits due to our former life employees and agents, and to the extent required, payments related to indemnification of liabilities associated with the sale of various subsidiaries. We do not expect that it will be necessary to dividend additional funds from our insurance subsidiaries in order to fund 2013 holding company obligations; however, we may decide to do so. Sources of cash for our insurance subsidiaries primarily consist of premiums collected, investment income and maturing investments. Primary cash outflows are paid claims, losses and loss adjustment expenses, policy acquisition expenses, other underwriting expenses and investment purchases. Cash outflows related to losses and loss adjustment expenses can be variable because of uncertainties surrounding settlement dates for liabilities for unpaid losses and because of the potential for large losses either individually or in the aggregate. We periodically adjust our investment policy to respond to changes in short-term and long-term cash requirements. Net cash provided by operating activities was $408.2 million during 2012, compared to net cash provided by operations of $221.7 million in 2011 and $83.6 million in 2010. The $186.5 million increase in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily resulted from an increase in premiums, partially offset by an increase in loss and LAE payments. The $138.1 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily resulted from the absence, in 2011, of a $100.0 million contribution made to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2010, and increased premium collections in 2011, primarily associated with OneBeacon business written in 2010 and our Chaucer business. Net cash used in investing activities was $562.8 million during 2012, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $182.8 million in 2011 and net cash used in investing activities of $98.8 million in 2010. During 2012, cash used was primarily related to net purchases of fixed maturities as we invested cash from Chaucer and net investments in equity securities. Cash used to purchase investments was partially offset by cash received from the sale of a building. See Note 3 Investments in the Notes 76 Table of Contents to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. During 2011, cash provided by investing activities primarily resulted from $756.1 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired from Chaucer. This increase was partially offset by cash paid for the Chaucer acquisition totaling $468.4 million, which included an $11.3 million payment related to a foreign currency exchange forward contract, and the investment of a portion of our Chaucer segment cash into fixed maturities. During 2010, cash used was primarily related to our net purchases of equity securities and fixed maturities. Additionally, cash was used in 2010 in connection with our acquisitions and renewal rights transactions. Net cash used in financing activities was $133.4 million during 2012, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $127.3 million in 2011 and net cash used by financing activities of $8.6 million in 2010. During 2012, cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from the repurchases of $72.4 million of debt, the payment of dividends to shareholders, repurchases of our common stock and repayments of collateral held for our securities lending program, partially offset by the proceeds from the FHLBB debt borrowings. During 2011, cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from the issuance, on June 17, 2011, of $300.0 million of unsecured senior debentures. Cash received from the issuance of debt was partially offset by the repurchases of $86.8 million of debt, the payment of dividends to our shareholders, repayments of collateral related to our securities lending program, and repurchases of common stock. During 2010, cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from repurchases of common stock and debt, as well as the payment of dividends to our shareholders. These were substantially offset by proceeds from the issuance, on February 23, 2010, of $200.0 million unsecured senior debentures. Dividends to common shareholders are subject to quarterly board approval and declaration. During 2012, as declared by the Board, we paid three quarterly dividends of $0.30 per share and one quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share to our shareholders. The total dividends paid to our shareholders in 2012 were $55.1 million. We believe that our holding company assets are sufficient to provide for future shareholder dividends should the Board of Directors declare them. We expect to continue to generate sufficient positive operating cash to meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements relating to current operations, including the funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plan and the Chaucer pension plan. Based upon the current estimate of liabilities and certain assumptions regarding investment returns and other factors, our qualified defined benefit pension plan and Chaucer pension plan are underfunded by approximately $15 million and $26 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2012. The ultimate payment amounts for both the defined benefit plan and the Chaucer pension plan are based on several assumptions, including but not limited to, the rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate for benefit obligations, mortality experience, interest crediting rates and the ultimate valuation and determination of benefit obligations. Since differences between actual plan experience and our assumptions are almost certain, changes both positive and negative, to our funded status and ultimately our funding obligations in future periods are likely. Our insurance subsidiaries maintain a high degree of liquidity within their respective investment portfolios in fixed maturity and short-term investments. We believe that the quality of the assets we hold will allow us to realize the long-term economic value of our portfolio, including securities that are currently in an unrealized loss position. We do not anticipate the need to sell these securities to meet our insurance subsidiaries cash requirements since we expect our insurance subsidiaries to generate sufficient operating cash to meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements. However, there can be no assurance that unforeseen business needs or other items will not occur causing us to have to sell those securities in a loss position before their values fully recover, thereby causing us to recognize impairment charges in that time period. Since October 2007 and through December 2012, our Board of Directors has authorized aggregate repurchases of our common stock of up to $500 million. Repurchases may be executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated repurchase programs or other transactions. We are not required to purchase any specific number of shares or to make purchases by any certain date under this program. During 2012, we repurchased 0.5 million shares of our common stock through open market purchases at a cost of $20.0 million. Total repurchases under this program as of December 31, 2012 were 9.1 million shares at a cost of $384.8 million. Over the past several years, we have issued, through two separate transactions, $500 million in senior debentures and have received advances of $171.3 million through our membership in FHLBB as part of a collateralized borrowing program. In January 2013, we repaid $46.3 million of our FHLBB CDAs plus prepayment fees of $7.8 million for a total payment of $54.1 million. Additional information related to these borrowings is provided in Note 6 Debt and Credit Arrangements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Additionally, from time to time, we may also repurchase our debt. In 2012, we called $65.4 million of our subordinated unsecured notes related to Chaucer at par value. These notes had a carrying value of $60.3 million, resulting in a net loss of $5.1 million on the repurchases. In addition, 77 Table of Contents we called $7.0 million of capital securities related to AIX at par value. These retirements are expected to reduce our annual pre-tax interest costs by approximately $3 million. In 2011, we repurchased, in several transactions, $69.5 million of Junior Debentures at a cost of $72.1 million, resulting in a net loss of $2.6 million. In addition, we repurchased $4.0 million of surplus notes outstanding related to AIX, $8.0 million of capital securities related to AIX and $3.0 million of capital securities related to Professionals Direct, Inc. In 2010, we repurchased $36.5 million of our Junior Debentures at a cost of $38.5 million, resulting in a $2.0 million loss on the repurchases. We may decide to repurchase additional debt on an opportunistic basis. On August 2, 2011, we entered into a $200.0 million committed syndicated credit agreement which expires in August 2015, with an option to increase the facility to $250.0 million assuming no default and satisfaction of certain other conditions. The agreement also includes a $50 million sub-facility for standby letters of credit that can be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowings, if any, under this agreement are unsecured and incur interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, a designated base rate or the three month LIBOR plus applicable margin. The agreement provides covenants, including but not limited to, maintaining at least a certain level of consolidated equity, maximum consolidated leverage ratios, and an RBC ratio at our primary U.S. domiciled property and casualty companies. We had no borrowings under this agreement in 2011 and 2012. In November 2011, we entered into a Standby Letter of Credit Facility Agreement (the Facility Agreement ) not to exceed $180.0 million outstanding at any one time, with the option to increase the amount available for issuances of letters of credit to $270.0 million in the aggregate on one occasion only during the term of the Facility Agreement (subject to the consent of all lenders and assuming no default and satisfaction of other specified conditions). The agreement provides certain covenants including, but not limited to, the syndicates financial condition. The Facility Agreement is used to provide regulatory capital supporting Chaucer underwriting through two managed syndicates. The Facility Agreement expires on December 31, 2016. A letter of credit commission fee on outstanding letters of credit is payable quarterly, and ranges from 1.50% to 2.125% per annum, depending on our credit ratings for portions that are not cash collateralized, and 0.30% per annum for portions that are cash collateralized. We may, from time to time, collateralize a portion of the outstanding letter of credit. In addition to the commission fee on the uncollateralized outstanding letter of credit, a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments under the Facility Agreement is payable quarterly, and ranges from 0.60% to 0.85% per annum, depending on our credit ratings. Chaucer is also required to pay customary agency fees. Simultaneous with the Facility Agreement, in November 2011, we entered into a Guaranty Agreement (the Guaranty Agreement ) with Lloyds TSB Bank plc, as Facility Agent and Security Agent, pursuant to which, we unconditionally guarantee the obligations of Chaucer under the Facility Agreement. The Guaranty Agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum net worth, a minimum risk-based capital ratio at our primary U.S. domiciled property and casualty companies and a maximum leverage ratio, and certain negative covenants that limit our ability, among other things, to incur or assume certain debt, grant liens on our property, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, materially change the nature or conduct of our business and make restricted payments (except, in each case, as provided by certain exceptions). The Guaranty Agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties. At December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with the covenants of the aforementioned debt agreements. On March 31, 2010, we acquired Campania Holding Company, Inc. ( Campania ) for a cash purchase price of approximately $24 million, subject to various terms and conditions. Campania specializes in insurance solutions for portions of the healthcare industry. 78 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Financing obligations generally include repayment of our Senior Debentures, Junior Debentures, borrowings from the FHLBB, and operating lease payments. The following table represents our annual payments related to the contractual principal and interest payments of these financing obligations as of December 31, 2012 and operating lease payments reflect expected cash payments based upon lease terms. In addition, we also have included our estimated payments related to our loss and LAE obligations and our current expectation of payments to be made to support the obligations of our benefit plans. The following table also includes commitments to purchase investment securities at a future date. Actual payments may differ from the contractual and/or estimated payments in the table. DECEMBER 31, 2012 Maturity less than 1 year Maturity 1-3 years Maturity 4-5 years Maturity in excess of 5 years Total (in millions) Debt (1) $ 46.3 $ $ $ 803.1 $ 849.4 Interest associated with debt (1) 55.3 110.6 110.6 307.6 584.1 Operating lease commitments (2) 18.0 30.1 10.1 0.3 58.5 Qualified defined benefit pension plan funding obligations (3) Chaucer pension plan funding obligations (3) 4.5 9.2 9.5 16.9 40.1 Non-qualified defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit obligations (4) 7.5 14.5 13.0 29.0 64.0 Investment commitments (5) 7.4 7.3 2.6 17.3 Loss and LAE obligations (6) 2,089.7 1,968.9 820.4 1,318.0 6,197.0 (1) Debt includes our senior debentures due in 2025, which pay annual interest at a rate of 7 5/8%, our senior debentures due in 2020, which pay annual interest at a rate of 7.50%, our senior debentures due in 2021, which pay annual interest at a rate of 6.375%, and our junior subordinated debentures due in 2027, which pay cumulative dividends at an annual rate of 8.207%. Payments related to the principal amounts of these agreements represent contractual maturity; therefore, principal and interest associated with these obligations are reflected in the above table based upon the contractual maturity dates. In addition, we have $125.0 million of borrowings under a collateralized borrowing program with the FHLBB which pays interest monthly at a rate of 5.50% annually. Such borrowings are available for a twenty-year term or through September 25, 2029. We also have $46.3 million of CDAs under this collateralized borrowing program which pays interest monthly. All CDAs under this program with the FHLBB pay interest at a weighted average rate of 3.88%. We repaid these FHLBB CDAs in January 2013; such transaction is reflected in the less than one year category. (2) Our U.S. and international subsidiaries are lessees with a number of operating leases. (3) In 2010, we contributed $100.0 million to our qualified defined benefit pension plan and do not expect to make any significant additional contributions in order to meet our minimum funding requirements. However, additional contributions may be required in the future based on the level of pension assets and liabilities in future periods. Chaucer pension plan funding obligations reflect estimated payments to be made through plan year 2020 based on a payment schedule determined by the plan trustees. Additional contributions may be required for unfunded benefit obligations, if any, after plan year 2020 as determined by the plan trustees. For purposes of this table, we used the foreign currency exchange rate of 1.63 at December 31, 2012 to determine the future cash payments. The ultimate payment amount for these pension plans are based on several assumptions, including, but not limited to, the rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate for benefit obligations, mortality experience, interest crediting rates and the ultimate valuation of benefit obligations. Differences between actual plan experience and our assumptions are likely and will likely result in changes to our funding obligations in future periods. (4) Non-qualified defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations reflect estimated payments to be made through plan year 2022 for pension, postretirement and postemployment benefits. Estimates of these payments and the payment patterns are based upon historical experience. (5) Investment commitments relate primarily to partnerships. (6) Unlike many other forms of contractual obligations, loss and LAE reserves do not have definitive due dates and the ultimate payment dates are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties. As a result, the total loss and LAE reserve payments to be made by period, as shown in the table, are estimates based principally on historical experience. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We currently do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial position, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS Information regarding litigation and legal contingencies appears in Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Information related to certain regulatory and industry developments are contained in Regulation in Part 1 Item 1 of this Form 10-K and in Risk Factors in Part 1 Item 1A of this From 10-K. RATING AGENCIES Insurance companies are rated by rating agencies to provide both industry participants and insurance consumers information on specific insurance companies. Higher ratings generally indicate the rating agencies opinion regarding financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims. We believe that strong ratings are important factors in marketing our products to our agents and customers, since rating information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. Insurance company financial strength ratings are assigned to an insurer based upon factors deemed by the rating agencies to be relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors. Such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy, hold or sell any security. Customers typically focus on claims-paying ratings, while creditors focus on debt ratings. Investors use both to evaluate a company overall financial strength. 79 Table of Contents RISKS AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Management Discussion and Analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of indicators of forward-looking statements and specific important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, see Risk Factors in Part 1 Item 1A of this Form 10-K. This Management Discussion and Analysis should be read and interpreted in light of such factors. GLOSSARY OF SELECTED INSURANCE TERMS Account rounding The conversion of single policy customers to accounts with multiple policies and/or additional coverages. Benefit payments Payments made to an insured or their beneficiary in accordance with the terms of an insurance policy. Capacity The maximum amount of business which may be accepted by a syndicate or a corporate member on a syndicate, expressed in terms of gross premium written, net of commission. Casualty insurance Insurance that is primarily concerned with the losses caused by injuries to third persons and their property (other than the policyholder) and the related legal liability of the insured for such losses. Catastrophe A severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as hurricane, fire, earthquake, windstorm, tornado, hailstorm, severe winter weather, drought, explosion, terrorism, riots and other similar events. Catastrophe loss Loss and directly identified loss adjustment expenses from catastrophes. The Insurance Services Office ( ISO ) Property Claim Services ( PCS ) defines a catastrophe loss as an event that causes $25 million or more in U.S. industry insured property losses and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers. In addition to those catastrophe events declared by ISO, claims management also generally includes within the definition of a catastrophe loss , a property loss event that causes approximately $5 million or more in company insured losses and affects in excess of one hundred policyholders or multiple independent risks. For the international business in our Chaucer segment, management utilizes a catastrophe loss definition that is substantially consistent with the ISO definition framework. Cede; cedent; ceding company When a party reinsures its liability with another, it cedes business and is referred to as the cedent or ceding company . Combined ratio, GAAP This ratio is the GAAP equivalent of the statutory ratio that is widely used as a benchmark for determining an insurer underwriting performance. A ratio below 100% generally indicates profitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income. A combined ratio over 100% generally indicates unprofitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio, the loss adjustment expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio. Corporate member A company admitted to membership of Lloyd and which provides capital in support of a Lloyd syndicate to enable the syndicate to undertake underwriting risks. Credit spread The difference between the yield on the debt securities of a particular corporate debt issue and the yield of a similar maturity of U.S. Treasury debt securities. Current accident year loss results A non-GAAP measure of the estimated earnings impact of current premiums offset by estimated loss experience and expenses for the current accident year. This measure includes the estimated increase in revenue associated with higher prices (premiums), including those caused by price inflation and changes in exposure, partially offset by higher volume driven expenses and inflation of loss costs. Volume driven expenses include policy acquisition costs such as commissions paid to property and casualty agents, which are typically based on a percentage of premium dollars. Dividends received deduction A corporation is entitled to a special tax deduction from gross income for dividends received from a domestic corporation that is subject to income tax. Earned premium The portion of a premium that is recognized as income, or earned, based on the expired portion of the policy period, that is, the period for which loss coverage has actually been provided. For example, after six months, $50 of a $100 annual premium is generally considered earned premium. The remaining $50 of annual premium is unearned premium. Net earned premium is earned premium net of reinsurance. Economic interest The share of syndicate underwriting capacity supported by capital from Chaucer Holdings plc. Excess of loss reinsurance Reinsurance that indemnifies the insured against all or a specific portion of losses under reinsured policies in excess of a specified dollar amount or retention . Expense Ratio, GAAP The ratio of underwriting expenses to premiums earned for a given period. Exposure As it relates to underwriting, a measure of the rating units or premium basis of a risk; for example, an exposure of a number of automobiles. As it relates to loss 80 Table of Contents events, the maximum value of claims made on an insurer from an event or events that would result in the total exhaustion of the cover or indemnity offered by an insurance policy. Exposure management actions Actions that focus on improving underwriting profitability and/or lessening earnings volatility by reducing our exposures and property concentrations in certain geographies and lines that are more prone to both catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses. These actions include, but are not limited to, non-renewal, rate increases, stricter underwriting standards and higher deductible utilization, agency management actions, and more selective portfolio management by modifying our business mix. Frequency The number of claims occurring during a given coverage period. Funds at Lloyd Funds held in trust at Lloyd as security for the policyholders and to support a corporate member overall underwriting activities. The funds must be in a form approved by Lloyd and be maintained at certain specified levels. Inland Marine Insurance In Commercial Lines, this is a type of coverage developed for shipments that do not involve ocean transport. It covers articles in transit by all forms of land and air transportation as well as bridges, tunnels and other means of transportation and communication. In the context of Personal Lines, this term relates to floater policies that cover expensive personal items such as fine art and jewelry. Loss adjustment expenses ( LAE ) Expenses incurred in the adjusting, recording, and settlement of claims. These expenses include both internal company expenses and outside services. Examples of LAE include claims adjustment services, adjuster salaries and fringe benefits, legal fees and court costs, investigation fees and claims processing fees. Loss adjustment expense ( LAE ) ratio, GAAP The ratio of loss adjustment expenses to earned premiums for a given period. Loss costs An amount of money paid for a property and casualty claim. Loss ratio, GAAP The ratio of losses to premiums earned for a given period. Loss reserves Liabilities established by insurers to reflect the estimated cost of claims payments and the related expenses that the insurer will ultimately be required to pay in respect of insurance it has written. Reserves are established for losses and for LAE. Managing agent An agent that runs the affairs of a syndicate. Multivariate product An insurance product, the pricing for which is based upon the magnitude of, and correlation between, multiple rating factors. In practical application, the term refers to the foundational analytics and methods applied to the product construct. Our Connections Auto product is an example of a multivariate product. Peril A cause of loss. Price(ing) increase or decrease (Commercial Lines and Chaucer) Represents the average change in premium on renewed policies caused by the estimated net effect of base rate changes, discretionary pricing, inflation or changes in policy level exposure or insured risk. Price(ing) increase or decrease (Personal Lines) The estimated cumulative premium effect of approved rate actions applied to policies available for renewal, regardless of whether or not policies are actually renewed. Pricing changes do not represent actual increases or decreases realized by the Company. Property insurance Insurance that provides coverage for tangible property in the event of loss, damage or loss of use. Rate The estimated pure pricing factor upon which the policyholder premium is based excluding changes in exposure or risk. Reinstatement premium A pro-rata reinsurance premium that may be charged for reinstating the amount of reinsurance coverage reduced as the result of a reinsurance loss payment under a reinsurance treaty. For events that we are the insured party, the charge would decrease premiums; for events where we provide reinsurance coverage, the charge would increase premiums. For example, in 2005, this premium was required to ensure that our property catastrophe occurrence treaty, which was exhausted by Hurricane Katrina, was available again in the event of another large catastrophe loss in 2005. Reinsurance An arrangement in which an insurance company, or a reinsurance company, known as the reinsurer, agrees to indemnify another insurance or reinsurance company, known as the ceding company, against all or a portion of the insurance or reinsurance risks underwritten by the ceding company under one or more policies. Reinsurance can provide a ceding company with several benefits, including a reduction in net liability on risks and catastrophe protection from large or multiple losses. Reinsurance does not legally discharge the primary insurer from its liability with respect to its obligations to the insured. 81 Table of Contents Risk based capital ( RBC ) A method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The RBC ratio for regulatory purposes is calculated as total adjusted capital divided by required risk based capital. Total adjusted capital for property and casualty companies is capital and surplus, adjusted for the non-tabular reserve discount applicable to our assumed discontinued accident and health insurance business. The Company Action Level is the first level at which regulatory involvement is specified based upon the level of capital. Regulators may take action for reasons other than triggering various RBC action levels. The various action levels are summarized as follows: The Company Action Level, which equals 200% of the Authorized Control Level, requires a company to prepare and submit a RBC plan to the commissioner of the state of domicile. A RBC plan proposes actions which a company may take in order to bring statutory capital above the Company Action Level. After review, the commissioner will notify the company if the plan is satisfactory. The Regulatory Action Level, which equals 150% of the Authorized Control Level, requires the insurer to submit to the commissioner of the state of domicile an RBC plan, or if applicable, a revised RBC plan. After examination or analysis, the commissioner will issue an order specifying corrective actions to be taken. The Authorized Control Level authorizes the commissioner of the state of domicile to take whatever regulatory actions considered necessary to protect the best interest of the policyholders and creditors of the insurer. The Mandatory Control Level, which equals 70% of the Authorized Control Level, authorizes the commissioner of the state of domicile to take actions necessary to place the company under regulatory control (i.e., rehabilitation or liquidation). Security Lending We engage our banking provider to lend securities from our investment portfolio to third parties. These lent securities are fully collateralized by cash. We monitor the fair value of the securities on a daily basis to assure that the collateral is maintained at a level of at least 102% of the fair value of the loaned securities. We record securities lending collateral as a cash equivalent, with an offsetting liability in expenses and taxes payable. Severity A monetary increase in the loss costs associated with the same or similar type of event or coverage. Solvency II European Commission-led fundamental review of the capital adequacy regime for the European insurance industry. Specialty Lines A major component of our other commercial lines. There is no accepted industry definition of specialty lines , but for our purpose specialty lines consist of products such as inland and ocean marine, surety, specialty property, professional liability, management liability and various other program businesses. When discussing net written premiums and other financial measures of our specialty businesses, we may include non-specialty premiums that are written as part of the entire account. Statutory accounting principles Recording transactions and preparing financial statements in accordance with the rules and procedures prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities including the NAIC, which in general reflect a liquidating, rather than going concern, concept of accounting. Supranational An international organization, or union, whereby member states transcend national boundaries or interests to share in the decision-making and vote on issues pertaining to the wider grouping. European Investment Bank is an example of a supranational. Syndicate A group of members underwriting insurance at Lloyd through the agency of a managing agent, to whom a particular syndicate number is assigned. Underwriting The process of selecting risks for insurance and determining in what amounts and on what terms the insurance company will accept risks. Underwriting expenses Expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition, pricing and administration of a policy. Underwriting expense ratio, GAAP The ratio of underwriting expenses to earned premiums in a given period. Unearned premiums The portion of a premium representing the unexpired amount of the contract term as of a certain date. Written premium The premium assessed for the entire coverage period of a property and casualty policy without regard to how much of the premium has been earned. See also earned premium. Net written premium is written premium net of reinsurance.
