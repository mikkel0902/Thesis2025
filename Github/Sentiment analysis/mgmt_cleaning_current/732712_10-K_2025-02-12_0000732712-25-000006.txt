Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Verizon Communications Inc. is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world leading providers of communications, technology, information and streaming products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we offer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are designed to meet customers demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity and security. To compete effectively in today dynamic marketplace, we are focused on the capabilities of our high-performing networks to drive growth based on delivering what customers want and need in the digital world. We are consistently deploying new network architecture and technologies to secure our leadership in both 5G and 4G wireless networks. Our network quality is the hallmark of our brand and the foundation for the connectivity, platforms and solutions upon which we build our competitive advantage. In 2024, we focused on enhancing and driving the monetization of our networks, platforms and solutions, retaining and growing our high-quality customer base and further improving our financial and operating performance. Our strategy requires significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the spectrum into service, provide additional capacity for growth in our networks, invest in the fiber that supports our businesses, evolve and maintain our networks and develop and maintain significant advanced information technology systems and data system capabilities. We believe that our C-Band spectrum, together with our industry leading millimeter wave spectrum holdings and our 4G LTE network and fiber infrastructure, will drive innovative products and services and fuel our growth. Highlights of Our 2024 Financial Results (dollars in millions) Business Overview We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Consumer and Business. 23 Table of Contents Revenue by Segment Note: Excludes eliminations. Verizon Consumer Group Our Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the U.S. under the Verizon family of brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide FWA broadband through our 5G or 4G LTE networks as an alternative to traditional landline internet access. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. Customers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Our postpaid service is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only to Consumer customers and enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. The Consumer segment also offers several categories of wireless equipment to customers, including a variety of smartphones and other handsets, wireless-enabled internet devices, such as tablets, and other wireless-enabled connected devices, such as smart watches. In addition to wireless services and equipment for retail customers, the Consumer segment sells residential fixed connectivity solutions, including internet, video and voice services, and wireless network access to resellers on a wholesale basis. The Consumer segment's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $102.9 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 1.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. See "Segment Results of Operations" for additional information regarding our Consumer segment operating performance and selected operating statistics. Verizon Business Group Our Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including FWA broadband, data, video and advanced communication services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various IoT services and products. We provide these products and services to businesses, public sector customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and a subset of these products and services to customers around the world. The Business segment's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $29.5 billion, a decrease of $591 million, or 2.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. See "Segment Results of Operations" for additional information regarding our Business segment's operating performance and selected operating statistics. Corporate and Other Corporate and other primarily includes device insurance programs, investments in unconsolidated businesses and development stage businesses that support our strategic initiatives, as well as unallocated corporate expenses, certain pension and other employee benefit related costs and interest and financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested businesses and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated or used in assessing segment performance due to their nature. Although such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these transactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results and therefore are included in the chief operating decision maker's assessment of segment performance. See "Consolidated Results of Operations" for additional information regarding Corporate and other results. 24 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures and Investments We continue to invest in our wireless networks, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the center of growth trends for the future. During the year ended December 31, 2024, these investments included $17.1 billion for capital expenditures . See "Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information. Global Networks and Technology We consider the reliability, speed, capacity, coverage and security of our wireless network to be key factors in our continued success. We are evolving and transforming our networks to ensure our customers receive access to the best network possible. Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services. Our evolution to 5G with its new architecture allows us to simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements. While we continue to improve our 5G wireless service coverage, we are also adding capacity and density to our networks. Network densification enables us to increase coverage, improve quality of service and add capacity to accommodate an increasing number of users. In addition to enhancing our wireless service, our wireless mobility investments provide the foundation for our growing FWA broadband business. We are also continuing to expand our fiber-based networks, as customers increasingly value the ability to obtain wireless and wireline broadband services from the same provider. In September 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Frontier as part of our fiber expansion strategy, and we expect to increase the capital expenditures we devote to our fiber networks in 2025. Consolidated Results of Operations In this section, we discuss our overall results of operations and highlight special items that are not included in our segment results. In "Segment Results of Operations," we review the performance of our two reportable segments in more detail. A detailed discussion of our 2022 results and year-over-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Consolidated Operating Revenues (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Increase/(Decrease) Consumer $ 102,904 $ 101,626 $ 1,278 1.3 % Business 29,531 30,122 (591) (2.0) Corporate and other 2,609 2,479 130 5.2 Eliminations (256) (253) (3) 1.2 Consolidated Operating Revenues $ 134,788 $ 133,974 $ 814 0.6 Consolidated operating revenues increased during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to revenue increases in our Consumer segment, partially offset by revenue decreases in our Business segment. Revenues for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Segment Results of Operations." Consolidated Operating Expenses (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Increase/(Decrease) Cost of services $ 27,997 $ 28,100 $ (103) (0.4) % Cost of wireless equipment 26,100 26,787 (687) (2.6) Selling, general and administrative expense 34,113 32,745 1,368 4.2 Depreciation and amortization expense 17,892 17,624 268 1.5 Verizon Business Group goodwill impairment 5,841 (5,841) nm Consolidated Operating Expenses $ 106,102 $ 111,097 $ (4,995) (4.5) nm - not meaningful Operating expenses for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Segment Results of Operations." 25 Table of Contents Cost of Services Cost of services includes the following costs directly attributable to a service: salaries and wages, benefits, materials and supplies, content costs, contracted services, network access and transport costs, customer provisioning costs, computer systems support and costs to support our outsourcing contracts and technical facilities. Aggregate customer service costs, which include billing and service provisioning, are allocated between Cost of services and Selling, general and administrative expense. Cost of services decreased during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of: a decrease of $259 million in access costs primarily as a result of decreases in prepaid subscribers, changes in usage and net circuit access prices; a decrease of $147 million in personnel costs primarily related to the impact of workforce changes; an increase of $167 million related to an asset and business rationalization charge taken in 2024 compared to an asset rationalization charge taken in 2023; and an increase of $152 million in digital content costs primarily associated with an increase in subscriptions through MyPlan offerings, partially offset by a decrease in traditional linear content costs due to a decline in Fios video subscribers. Cost of Wireless Equipment Cost of wireless equipment decreased during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of: a decrease of $2.1 billion driven by a lower volume of wireless devices sold primarily related to a decrease of 10% in upgrades; and an increase of $1.4 billion due to a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless devices sold. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense includes salaries and wages and benefits not directly attributable to a service or product, the provision for credit losses, taxes other than income taxes, advertising and sales commission costs, call center and information technology costs, regulatory fees, professional service fees and rent and utilities for administrative space. Also included is a portion of the aggregate customer care costs as discussed above in "Cost of Services." Selling, general and administrative expense increased during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of: an increase of $1.2 billion due to severance charges in 2024 primarily related to our voluntary separation program compared to 2023; an increase of $240 million in personnel costs related to an increase in costs associated with the transition to third-party contracted resources along with the impacts of a prior year compensation plan assumption change that did not reoccur and increased sales commission expense; an increase of $124 million in the provision for credit losses resulting from an increase in postpaid phone gross additions and additional bad debt reserves; an increase of $124 million in advertising costs related to Value Brand marketing campaigns and the refresh of the Verizon brand in 2024 compared to 2023; a decrease of $273 million related to an asset and business rationalization charge taken in 2024 compared to an asset rationalization charge taken in 2023; and a decrease of $161 million related to business transformation costs in 2023 that did not reoccur. See "Special Items" for additional information on the severance charges, the asset and business rationalization charges and the business transformation costs. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense increased during 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to the change in the mix of net depreciable and amortizable assets, including the amortization period of certain acquisition-related intangible assets, and the continued deployment of C-Band network assets. Verizon Business Group Goodwill Impairment During 2023, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $5.8 billion as a result of the annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" for additional information. 26 Table of Contents Other Consolidated Results Other Income (Expense), Net Additional information relating to Other income (expense), net is as follows: (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Increase/(Decrease) Interest income $ 336 $ 354 $ (18) (5.1) % Other components of net periodic benefit income (cost) 300 (938) 1,238 nm Net debt extinguishment gains 385 308 77 25.0 Other, net (26) (37) 11 (29.7) Other Income (Expense), Net $ 995 $ (313) $ 1,308 nm nm - not meaningful Other income (expense), net reflects certain items not directly related to our core operations, including interest income, debt extinguishment gains and losses, components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income and cost and certain foreign exchange gains and losses. Other income (expense), net increased during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to a net pension and postretirement benefits remeasurement gain of $657 million recorded during 2024, compared with a loss of $992 million recorded during 2023. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $396 million due to lower plan assets on which to earn expected returns in our pension and postretirement plans compared to 2023. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the other components of net periodic benefit income (cost). Interest Expense (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Increase/(Decrease) Total interest costs on debt balances $ 7,612 $ 7,342 $ 270 3.7 % Less capitalized interest costs 963 1,818 (855) (47.0) Interest Expense $ 6,649 $ 5,524 $ 1,125 20.4 Average debt outstanding (1)(3) $ 150,361 $ 151,062 Effective interest rate (2)(3) 5.1 % 4.9 % (1) The average debt outstanding is a financial measure and is calculated by applying a simple average of prior thirteen-month end balances of total short-term and long-term debt, net of discounts, premiums and unamortized debt issuance costs. (2) The effective interest rate is the rate of actual interest incurred on debt. It is calculated by dividing the total interest costs on debt balances by the average debt outstanding. (3) We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our debt financing cost and trends in our debt leverage management. Total interest expense increased during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of a decrease in capitalized interest due to additional C-Band spectrum licenses being placed into service and an increase in interest costs due to a higher average interest rate partially offset by lower average debt balances. Provision for Income Taxes (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Increase Provision for income taxes $ 5,030 $ 4,892 $ 138 2.8 % Effective income tax rate 21.9 % 28.8 % The effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before the provision for income taxes. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the Verizon Business Group goodwill impairment charge of $5.8 billion in 2023 that substantially decreased income before income taxes and was not deductible. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in 2024 in income before income taxes. A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for each period is included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. 27 Table of Contents Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense (Consolidated EBITDA) and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which are presented below, are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense to net income. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, as well as the effect of certain special items. We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to compare a company operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes, and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. See "Special Items" for additional information. It is management intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Consolidated Net Income $ 17,949 $ 12,095 Add: Provision for income taxes 5,030 4,892 Interest expense 6,649 5,524 Depreciation and amortization expense (1) 17,892 17,624 Consolidated EBITDA $ 47,520 $ 40,135 Add (Less): Other (income) expense, net (2) $ (995) $ 313 Equity in losses of unconsolidated businesses 53 53 Severance charges 1,733 533 Asset and business rationalization 374 480 Legacy legal matter 106 Verizon Business Group goodwill impairment 5,841 Legal settlement 100 Business transformation costs 176 Non-strategic business shutdown 158 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA $ 48,791 $ 47,789 (1) Includes Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, which were $817 million and $865 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The results for the year ended December 31, 2023 also include a portion of the charges associated with the Non-strategic business shutdown. See "Special Items" for additional information. (2) Includes Pension and benefits mark-to-market credits of $532 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 and charges of $992 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. See "Special Items" for additional information. The changes in Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in the table above during 2024 compared to 2023 were primarily a result of the factors described above in connection with consolidated operating revenues and consolidated operating expenses. Segment Results of Operations We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Consumer and Business. We measure and evaluate our segments based on segment operating income. The use of segment operating income is consistent with the chief operating decision maker assessment of segment performance. 28 Table of Contents To aid in the understanding of segment performance as it relates to segment operating income, management uses the following operating statistics to evaluate the overall effectiveness of our segments. We believe these operating statistics are useful to investors and other users of our financial information because they provide additional insight into drivers of our segments operating results, key trends and performance relative to our peers. These operating statistics may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to those statistics of other companies.

Segment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Segment EBITDA) , which is presented below, is a non-GAAP measure and does not purport to be an alternative to operating income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. We believe this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income (loss). Segment EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Service Revenue Service revenue increased during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by an increase in Wireless service revenue. 31 Table of Contents Wireless service revenue increased during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of: an increase of $1.5 billion in access revenues related to our postpaid plans primarily due to pricing actions, an increase in subscriptions through MyPlan offerings and a 45% increase in our FWA subscriber base. These increases were partially offset by the amortization of wireless equipment sales promotions; an increase of $638 million related to growth in non-retail service revenue; an increase of $318 million in TravelPass revenue due to increased customer international travel; and a decrease of $625 million in prepaid revenue primarily due to a decrease in the prepaid subscriber base partially driven by the termination of the Affordable Connectivity Program in the second quarter of 2024. Wireless Equipment Revenue Wireless equipment revenue decreased during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of: a decrease of $1.5 billion driven by a lower volume of wireless devices sold primarily related to a decrease of 10% in upgrades; and an increase of $474 million due to a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless devices sold, partially offset by the impact of related promotions. Other Revenue Other revenue includes fees that partially recover the direct and indirect costs of complying with regulatory and industry obligations and programs, revenues associated with certain products included in our device protection offerings, leasing and interest recognized when equipment is sold to the customer by an authorized agent under a device payment plan agreement. Other revenue increased during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to: an increase of $193 million driven by regulatory surcharges primarily related to a higher net Federal Universal Service Fund rate, along with an increase in other regulatory surcharges; and an increase of $116 million related to device protection offerings primarily due to changes in the products offered and pricing actions.

(2) As of end of period Where applicable, the operating results reflect certain adjustments, including those related to the 3G network shutdowns, migration activity among different types of devices and plans, customer profile changes, and adjustments in connection with mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. Business's total operating revenues decreased during 2024 compared to 2023 as a result of decreases in Enterprise and Public Sector and Wholesale revenues, partially offset by an increase in Business Markets and Other revenue. Enterprise and Public Sector Enterprise and Public Sector offers wireless products and services as well as wireline connectivity such as broadband and managed services to our large business and public sector customers. Large businesses are identified based on their size and volume of business with Verizon. Public sector customers include U.S. federal, state and local governments and educational institutions. Our offerings to this customer group include plans with features and pricing designed to address their specific needs. Enterprise and Public Sector revenues decreased during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to a decrease of $702 million in wireline revenue primarily driven by declines in networking, traditional data and voice communication services along with related professional services. These declines were due to secular market pressure and technology shifts, coupled with lower customer premise equipment sales volumes. Business Markets and Other Business Markets and Other offers wireless services (including FWA broadband), wireless equipment, advanced communication services, tailored voice and networking products, Fios services, advanced voice solutions and security services to businesses 34 Table of Contents that ordinarily do not meet the requirements to be categorized as Enterprise and Public Sector, as described above. Business Markets and Other also includes solutions that support mobile resource management. Business Markets and Other revenue increased during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of: an increase of $486 million in Wireless service revenue primarily due to pricing actions and an increase in our FWA subscriber base; and a decrease of $89 million in connection with the shutdown of our BlueJeans business offering in 2023 and a decline in traditional voice communication revenues. Wholesale Wholesale offers wireline communications services including data, voice, local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local, long distance, and wireless carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers. Wholesale revenues decreased during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to a decrease of $117 million related to declines in traditional voice communication and network connectivity as a result of technology substitution, as well as a decrease in core data.

Cost of Wireless Equipment Cost of wireless equipment decreased during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of: a decrease of $385 million driven by a lower volume of wireless devices sold; and an increase of $267 million due to a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless devices sold. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense increased during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of: an increase of $221 million in personnel costs primarily related to an increase in costs associated with the transition to third-party contracted resources along with the impacts of a prior year compensation plan assumption change that did not reoccur; and a decrease of $63 million in the provision for credit losses resulting from a reduction in bad debt reserves. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense decreased during 2024 compared to 2023 driven by the change in the mix of total Verizon depreciable and amortizable assets and Business's usage of those assets. 35 Table of Contents Segment Operating Income and EBITDA (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Decrease Segment Operating Income $ 2,058 $ 2,066 $ (8) (0.4) % Add Depreciation and amortization expense 4,307 4,488 (181) (4.0) Segment EBITDA $ 6,365 $ 6,554 $ (189) (2.9) Segment operating income margin 7.0 % 6.9 % Segment EBITDA margin 21.6 % 21.8 % The changes in the table above during the periods presented were primarily a result of the factors described above in connection with Business operating revenues and operating expenses.

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure discussed in the section titled "Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA" as part of Consolidated Results of Operations, excludes all of the amounts included above. The income and expenses related to special items included in our consolidated results of operations were as follows: (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Within Total Operating Expenses $ 3,030 $ 8,174 Within Other (income) expense, net (532) 992 Total $ 2,498 $ 9,166 Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets During 2024 and 2023, we recorded pre-tax amortization expense of $817 million and $865 million, respectively, related to acquired intangible assets. 36 Table of Contents Severance, Pension and Benefits Charges (Credits) During 2024, we recorded pre-tax severance charges of $1.7 billion, related to separations under our voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees as well as other headcount reduction initiatives. The severance charges were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income. During 2024, in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur, we recorded a net pre-tax pension and benefits credit of $532 million in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The net gain was recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income and was primarily driven by: a credit of $1.3 billion ($635 million for pension plans and $656 million for postretirement benefit plans) due to an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our plans from a weighted-average of 5.0% for both our pension and post retirement plans at December 31, 2023 to a weighted-average of 5.8% for our pension plans and 5.6% for our postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2024; a charge of $711 million due to the difference between our estimated and actual return on assets; and a net charge of $48 million primarily due to other actuarial assumption adjustments. During 2023, we recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $533 million, primarily related to involuntary separations under our existing plans, in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income. During 2023, in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur, we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits charges of $992 million in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The charges were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income and were primarily driven by: a charge of $534 million due to an increase in our healthcare cost trend rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 6.6% at December 31, 2022 to a weighted-average of 7.3% at December 31, 2023; a charge of $503 million ($288 million for pension plans and $215 million for postretirement benefit plans) due to a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our plans from a weighted-average of 5.2% at December 31, 2022 to a weighted-average of 5.0% at December 31, 2023; and a net credit of $45 million primarily due to other actuarial assumption adjustments, which includes the difference between our estimated and our actual return on plan assets. Due to the presentation of the other components of net periodic benefit cost, we recognize a portion of the pension and benefits charges (credits) in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to severance, pension and benefits charges (credits). Asset and Business Rationalization During 2024, we recorded a pre-tax asset and business rationalization charge of $374 million predominately related to the decision to cease use of certain real estate assets and exit non-strategic portions of certain businesses as part of our continued transformation initiatives. During 2023, we recorded pre-tax asset rationalization charges of $480 million. Asset rationalization charges of $155 million recorded during the second quarter of 2023 related to certain real estate and non-strategic assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our transformation initiatives. Asset rationalization charges of $325 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily related to Business network assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our continued transformation initiatives. Legacy Legal Matter During 2024, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $106 million associated with a litigation matter related to a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of the Company. Verizon Business Group Goodwill Impairment During 2023, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $5.8 billion as a result of the annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" for additional information. Legal Settlement During 2023, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $100 million related to the settlement of a litigation matter regarding certain administrative fees. Business Transformation Costs During 2023, we recorded pre-tax charges of $176 million primarily related to costs incurred in connection with strategic partnership initiatives in our managed network support services for certain Business customers. 37 Table of Contents Non-Strategic Business Shutdown During 2023, we recorded pre-tax charges of $179 million related to the shutdown of our BlueJeans business offering. Operating Environment and Trends The telecommunications industry is highly competitive, and we expect competition to remain intense as traditional and non-traditional participants seek increased market share. We believe that our high-quality networks and customer base in addition to our attractive offerings and value proposition differentiate us from our competitors and give us the ability to plan and manage through changing market conditions. We remain focused on executing on the fundamentals of the business: enhancing our networks, offering innovative services and products, growing and maintaining a high-quality customer base, and delivering strong financial and operating results. We also continue to focus on cost efficiencies in order to have flexibility to adjust to changes in the competitive and economic environments and increase shareholder value. The U.S. wireless market has achieved a high penetration of smartphones, which reduces the opportunity for new phone connection growth for the industry. We expect the wireless industry's customer growth rate to moderate over time in comparison to historical growth rates, furthering competition for customers. Future revenue growth in the industry is expected to be driven by expanding existing customer relationships, increasing the number of ways customers can connect with wireless networks and services and increasing the penetration of FWA and connected devices including wearables, tablets and IoT devices. Although certain advanced use cases for 5G technologies and related ecosystems are in the early phases of adoption, we believe that they will provide an opportunity for growth in the coming years. We expect future service revenue growth opportunities to arise from increased access revenue as customer demand for mobile and FWA 5G connectivity continues to expand and customers shift to higher access plans. Additionally, we expect service revenue to benefit from targeted pricing actions and increased connections per account. Future service revenue growth opportunities will be dependent on expanding the penetration of our services, increasing the number of ways that our customers can connect with our networks and services and the development of new 5G use cases and ecosystems. Pricing plays an increasingly important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering a range of service plans and bundled services at competitive prices. In addition, aggressive device promotions have become more common in recent years in an effort to encourage customers to switch carriers, as well as retain existing customers. We compete in this area by offering our customers services and devices, with a variety of content options and other perks, that we believe provide significant value for the price. We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and some providers offer device leasing arrangements. For further details on competitive environment and trends, refer to "Business Competition and Related Trends" in Part I, Item 1 and "Risk Factors Economic and Strategic Risks We face significant competition that may negatively affect our operating results" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Connection Trends In our Consumer segment, we are focused on attracting new customers and maintaining our high-quality retail postpaid customer base by capitalizing on demand for reliable high-speed connectivity and customizable, personalized offerings and solutions. We believe the combination of our wireless network quality and service and product offerings represents an attractive value proposition and provides a compelling customer experience, supporting increased penetration of data services. While our Consumer segment experienced diminished wireless connection growth in recent years, we expect that future connection growth opportunities will be driven by the comparative value we provide to our customers, as well as our FWA broadband service. In our prepaid business, while we expect to continue to operate in a highly competitive environment, we are making improvements to achieve long-term growth. We expect to continue to grow our Fios internet connections as we seek to expand availability of Fios, increase our penetration rates within our Fios service areas, and experience continued strong demand for higher speed internet connections. Our pending acquisition of Frontier is expected to enhance our fiber broadband footprint and provide opportunities for future growth. At the same time, we expect continued growth of FWA connections to complement strong Fios results as demand for broadband services continues to grow. In Fios video, the business continues to face ongoing pressure as observed throughout the linear television market. We have experienced continuing access line and DSL losses as customers have switched to alternative technologies such as wireless, VoIP, and cable for voice and data services, and we expect this trend to continue. In our Business segment, we offer wireless products and services to business and public sector customers across the U.S. We continue to grow our connections while operating in a highly competitive environment. We expect that this connection growth, combined with our industry-leading network assets, will provide additional opportunities to sell solutions, such as those around security, private networking and other network connectivity services, advanced communications and professional services. 38 Table of Contents In addition, in both our Consumer and our Business segments, we expect to support connection growth in part by adding capacity and further expanding our wireless coverage, and by continuing the build-out and densification of our 5G network. Service Revenue Trends In our Consumer segment, we expect continued growth in our wireless service revenue, driven by targeted pricing actions, migrations to higher priced plans, increased offering of perks, and increases in FWA connections and revenue, offset in part by higher promotion amortization impacts in 2025. Our efforts to maintain and grow our customer base and make improvements to our prepaid business, if successful, are also expected to benefit our wireless service revenue. We expect Fios revenue to benefit from growth in our Fios customer base and an ongoing demand for higher speed internet connections, which offsets the impact of the shift from bundled wireline services to standalone internet service. In our Business segment, we expect wireless service revenue to expand, driven by growth from an increase in wireless volumes and strong FWA revenue. We expect that Fios, through increased penetration, will also contribute to revenue growth and that legacy traditional wireline services will continue to face secular pressures. Other Trends We are focused on achieving profitable growth as we continue to deliver strong revenues and undertake initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including through AI-driven technologies. We expect that our ability to generate cash flows will benefit from our expected service revenue growth, despite the moderate expected increase in our 2025 capital program compared to 2024. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information on our capital program. In the course of business, we make promotional equipment offers to attract and retain customers. In 2024, the growth of our wireless service revenue was unfavorably impacted by the amortization of wireless equipment sales and promotions. We expect these pressures to continue and increase in 2025. In addition, in 2023 and 2024, we had fewer phone upgrades compared to prior years. To the extent upgrade volumes increase in 2025, the expenses associated with those device sales are expected to contribute to higher costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources We use the net cash generated from our operations to invest in new businesses and spectrum, fund expansion and modernization of our networks, pay dividends, service and repay external financing and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary, from external financing arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements over the next 12 months and beyond. Our cash and cash equivalents balance is $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2024. Our cash and cash equivalents are held both domestically and internationally, and are invested to maintain principal and provide liquidity. See "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies. We expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds. Debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development activities, including, for example, to complete our acquisition of Frontier, or to maintain an appropriate capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility. Our external financing arrangements include credit facilities and other bank lines of credit, an active commercial paper program, vendor financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities, U.S. retail medium-term notes and other securities that are privately-placed or offered overseas. In addition, we monetize certain receivables through asset-backed debt transactions. Capital Expenditures Our 2025 capital program includes capital to fund advanced networks and services, including expanding and adding capacity and density to our core networks, the ongoing deployment of C-Band spectrum, and advancing our network architecture. It will also support our broadband expansion plans including the launch of our fixed wireless access solution for multi-dwelling units. We anticipate cash requirements for our 2025 capital program to be between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion. Contractual Obligations and Commitments We have various contractual obligations and commitments. The following represent our anticipated material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2024: Long-term debt, including current maturities, commitments of $142.2 billion, of which $21.7 billion (including $3.3 billion of unsecured debt) are expected to be due within the next twelve months. Related interest payments are $66.3 billion, of which $5.8 billion, are expected to be due within the next twelve months. Items included in long-term debt with variable coupon rates exclude unamortized debt issuance costs, and are described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. 39 Table of Contents Operating lease obligations of $29.1 billion and Finance lease obligations of $2.5 billion, of which $5.0 billion and $954 million, respectively, are expected to be due within the next twelve months. In addition, Verizon has an obligation of $3.7 billion representing future minimum payments under the leaseback and sublease arrangements for our cell towers, of which $447 million is expected to be due within the next twelve months. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Unconditional purchase obligations, with terms in excess of one year, amount to $16.7 billion, of which $6.2 billion is expected to be due within the next twelve months. Items included in unconditional purchase obligations are primarily commitments to purchase content, network equipment, software and services, marketing services and other items which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other long-term liabilities, including current maturities, of $3.9 billion, of which approximately $726 million is expected to be due within the next twelve months. Other long-term liabilities represent estimated postretirement benefit and qualified pension plan contributions. Qualified pension plan contributions include estimated minimum funding contributions. We expect that there will be no required pension funding through the end of 2025, subject to changes in market conditions. Postretirement benefit payments include future postretirement benefit payments. These estimated amounts: (1) are subject to change based on changes to assumptions and future plan performance, which could impact the timing and/or amounts of these payments; and (2) exclude expectations beyond 5 years due to uncertainty of the timing and amounts. We are not able to make a reasonable estimate of when the unrecognized tax benefits balance of $2.6 billion and related interest and penalties will be settled with the respective taxing authorities until the related tax audits are further developed or resolved. Consolidated Financial Condition (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Operating activities $ 36,912 $ 37,475 Investing activities (18,674) (23,432) Financing activities (17,100) (14,657) Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 1,138 $ (614) Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities Our primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $563 million during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in earnings and an increase in Other, net cash flow from operating activities. Changes in current assets and liabilities, net of effects from acquisition/disposition of businesses The change in working capital was primarily driven by higher cash income taxes paid in the current period as well as higher interest expense and severance payments primarily related to separations under our voluntary separation program. Other, Net Other, net cash flow from operating activities during 2024 includes $2.0 billion of proceeds related to the transaction with Vertical Bridge REIT, LLC (Vertical Bridge). These proceeds were partially offset by discretionary contributions made in March 2024 in the aggregate amount of $365 million to our qualified pension plans. We expect that there will be no required pension funding through the end of 2025, subject to changes in market conditions. Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures continue to relate primarily to the use of capital resources to enhance the operating efficiency and productivity of our networks, maintain our existing infrastructure, facilitate the introduction of new products and services and enhance responsiveness to competitive challenges. Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, were $17.1 billion and $18.8 billion for 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capital expenditures decreased approximately $1.7 billion during 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to the completion of our accelerated $10 billion C-Band deployment program in 2023. Acquisitions of Wireless Licenses During 2024 and 2023, we made payments of $269 million and $4.3 billion, respectively, for obligations related to clearing costs and accelerated clearing incentives associated with Auction 107 . 40 Table of Contents During 2024 and 2023, we recorded capitalized interest related to wireless licenses of $616 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. Collateral Receipts (Payments) Related to Derivative Contracts, Net During 2024, we made collateral payments of $712 million related to derivative contracts, net of receipts. During 2023, we received return of collateral posted of $880 million related to derivative contracts, net of payments. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities We seek to maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in market conditions. During 2024 and 2023, net cash used in financing activities was $17.1 billion and $14.7 billion, respectively. 2024 During 2024, our net cash used in financing activities of $17.1 billion was primarily driven by $20.3 billion used for repayments and repurchases of long-term borrowings (secured and unsecured) as well as finance lease obligations, $11.2 billion used for dividend payments, and $1.1 billion used for other financing activities. These cash flows used in financing activities were partially offset by $15.6 billion provided by proceeds from long-term borrowings, which included $12.4 billion of proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions. Proceeds from and Repayments and Repurchases of Long-Term Borrowings At December 31, 2024, our total debt decreased to $144.0 billion compared to $150.7 billion at December 31, 2023. Our effective interest rate was 5.1% and 4.9% during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have entered into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt, managing our exposure to changes in interest rates. See "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. At December 31, 2024, approximately $30.5 billion, or 20.6%, of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on our foreign denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses.

Verizon may acquire debt securities issued by Verizon and its affiliates through open market purchases, redemptions, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, exchange offers, or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as Verizon may from time to time determine, for cash or other consideration. Other, Net Other, net cash flow from financing activities during 2024 includes $830 million in proceeds related to financing obligations for the cell towers transaction with Vertical Bridge. These proceeds were partially offset by $431 million in payments related to vendor financing arrangements, $425 million in equity distribution payments made for controlled entities, $313 million in payments made under the sublease arrangement for our cell towers, $280 million in cash consideration payments to acquire additional interest in certain controlled entities and $243 million in payments for settlement of cross currency swaps. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Vertical Bridge transaction. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on noncontrolling interests. Dividends The Board of Directors of the Company assesses the level of our dividend payments on a periodic basis taking into account such factors as long-term growth opportunities, internal cash requirements and the expectations of our shareholders. During the third quarter of 2024, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend payment by 1.9% to $0.6775 from $0.6650 per share in the preceding quarter. This is the eighteenth consecutive year that Company Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend increase. As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2024, we paid $11.2 billion in dividends. 2023 During 2023, our net cash used in financing activities of $14.7 billion was primarily driven by $11.0 billion used for dividend payments, $10.6 billion used for repayments and repurchases of long-term borrowings (secured and unsecured) as well as finance lease obligations and $1.5 billion used for other financing activities. These cash flows used in financing activities were 41 Table of Contents partially offset by $8.6 billion provided by proceeds from long-term borrowings, which included $6.6 billion of proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions. Proceeds from and Repayments and Repurchases of Long-Term Borrowings At December 31, 2023, our total debt was $150.7 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2023, our effective interest rate was 4.9%. We have entered into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt, managing our exposure to changes in interest rates. See "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. At December 31, 2023, approximately $33.7 billion, or 21.7%, of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on our foreign denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional information. Other, Net Other, net cash flow from financing activities during 2023 includes $302 million in payments made under the sublease arrangement for our cell towers, $257 million in payments for contingent consideration related to the acquisition of TracFone Wireless, Inc. (TracFone) and $252 million in payments related to vendor financing arrangements. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the TracFone contingent considerations. Dividends During the third quarter of 2023, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend payment by 1.9% to $0.6650 per share. During 2023, we paid $11.0 billion in dividends. Asset-Backed Debt Cash collections on the receivables and on the underlying receivables related to the participation interest collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The asset-backed debt issued is included in Debt maturing within one year and Long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Long-Term Credit Facilities At December 31, 2024 (dollars in millions) Maturities Facility Capacity Unused Capacity Principal Amount Outstanding Verizon revolving credit facility (1) 2028 $ 12,000 $ 11,963 $ Various export credit facilities (2) 2025 - 2031 10,000 5,441 Total $ 22,000 $ 11,963 $ 5,441 (1) The revolving credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain specified credit ratings, and it permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material adverse change. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2024, there have been no drawings against the revolving credit facility since its inception. (2) During 2024, there were no drawings from these facilities. During 2023, we drew down $1.0 billion from these facilities. Borrowings under certain of these facilities are amortized semi-annually in equal installments up to the applicable maturity dates. Maturities reflect maturity dates of principal amounts outstanding. Any amounts borrowed under these facilities and subsequently repaid cannot be reborrowed. In March 2024, we amended our $9.5 billion revolving credit facility to increase the capacity to $12.0 billion and extended its maturity to 2028. 42 Table of Contents Common Stock Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we issued 5.4 million and 4.4 million shares of common stock from treasury stock, which had aggregate values of $238 million and $192 million, respectively. In February 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of our common stock. The program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, or a new share repurchase plan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is sooner. The program permits Verizon to repurchase shares over time, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs. There were no repurchases of common stock during 2024 and 2023 under our authorized share buyback program. Credit Ratings Verizon credit ratings did not change in 2024 or 2023. Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Covenants Our credit agreements contain covenants that are typical for large, investment grade companies. These covenants include requirements to pay interest and principal in a timely fashion, pay taxes, maintain insurance with responsible and reputable insurance companies, preserve our corporate existence, keep appropriate books and records of financial transactions, maintain our properties, provide financial and other reports to our lenders, limit pledging and disposition of assets and mergers and consolidations, and other similar covenants. We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements. Change In Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024 totaled $4.2 billion, a $2.1 billion increase compared to December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the factors discussed above. Restricted cash at December 31, 2024 totaled $441 million, a $991 million decrease compared to restricted cash at December 31, 2023, primarily related to cash collections on certain receivables and on the underlying receivables related to the participation interest that are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts. The decrease of $991 million in restricted cash was primarily due to a change in the timing on when cash collections on certain receivables collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required to be placed into segregated accounts. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides management, investors and other users of our financial information with a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow: (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 36,912 $ 37,475 Less Capital expenditures (including capitalized software) 17,090 18,767 Free cash flow $ 19,822 $ 18,708 The increase in free cash flow during 2024 is a reflection of the decrease in capital expenditures, partially offset by the decrease in operating cash flows, both of which are discussed above. 43 Table of Contents Employee Benefit Plans Funded Status and Contributions Employer Contributions We operate numerous qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These plans primarily relate to our domestic business units. During 2024, we made discretionary contributions in the aggregate amount of $365 million to our qualified pension plans. During 2023, we made a discretionary contribution of $200 million to one of our qualified pension plans. During 2024 and 2023, we made contributions of $56 million and $52 million to our nonqualified pension plans, respectively. Our overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return. In an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we have adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging assets with the interest rate sensitivity of the liability. We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline at a time when liabilities increase (referred to as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and its participants and beneficiaries. Over time, as the asset allocation shifts to more liability hedging assets, this strategy will generally result in lower expected asset returns. For 2025, we expect no required qualified pension plan contributions and insignificant nonqualified pension plan contributions. Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an as-incurred basis since these other postretirement benefit plans do not have funding requirements similar to the pension plans. We contributed $935 million and $936 million to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $726 million in 2025. Leasing Arrangements See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to leasing arrangements. Guarantees We guarantee the debentures of our operating telephone company subsidiaries. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. In connection with the execution of agreements for the sale of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as financial losses. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. As of December 31, 2024, letters of credit totaling approximately $816 million, which were executed in the normal course of business and support several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other Future Obligations As of December 31, 2024, Verizon had 28 renewable energy purchase agreements with third parties for a total of approximately 3.7 gigawatts of anticipated renewable energy capacity across multiple states. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Critical Accounting Estimates Critical Accounting Estimates A summary of the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements are as follows: Wireless Licenses and Goodwill Wireless licenses and goodwill are a significant component of our consolidated assets. Both our wireless licenses and goodwill are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter, unless there are events requiring an earlier assessment or changes in circumstances during an interim period suggesting impairment indicators are present. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent appropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation date. Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates and assumptions are uncertain by nature, may change over time and can vary from actual results. It is possible that in the future there may be changes in our estimates and assumptions, including the timing and amount of future cash flows, margins, growth rates, market participant assumptions, comparable benchmark companies and related multiples and discount rates, which could result in different fair value estimates. Significant and adverse changes to any one or more of the above-noted estimates and assumptions could result in an impairment to our wireless licenses and goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting units. 44 Table of Contents Wireless Licenses The carrying value of our wireless licenses was approximately $156.6 billion as of December 31, 2024. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network. Our wireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. There are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. We test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years. Our quantitative impairment assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. As a result, we were required to make significant estimates about future cash flows and profitability specifically associated with our wireless licenses, an appropriate discount rate based on the risk associated with those estimated cash flows and assumed terminal value and growth rates. We considered current and expected future economic conditions, current and expected availability of wireless network technology and infrastructure and related equipment and the costs thereof as well as other relevant factors in estimating future cash flows and profitability. The discount rate represented our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date and includes a risk premium associated with the current and expected economic conditions as of the valuation date. We developed the discount rate based on our consideration of the cost of debt and equity of a group of guideline companies as of the valuation date. The terminal value growth rate represented our estimate of the marketplace's long-term growth rate. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as our annual impairment test to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount. As part of our qualitative assessment we considered several factors including the enterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors including the result of our last quantitative assessment performed in 2021. Our annual impairment test in 2023 indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses remained above their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment in accordance with our policy. The quantitative impairment assessment we performed during the fourth quarter of 2024 indicated that the fair value of our wireless licenses is substantially in excess of their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. In the event of a 10% decline in the fair value of our wireless licenses, the fair value would have still exceeded their carrying value. We do not believe reasonable changes in significant estimates would change the outcome to this quantitative assessment. For instance, if either the terminal value growth rate declined by 50 basis points (bps) or if the WACC increased by 50 bps, the fair value of wireless licenses would still exceed their carrying value. Goodwill At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $22.8 billion, of which $21.2 billion was in our Consumer reporting unit and $1.7 billion was in our Business reporting unit. To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we elect not to conduct the qualitative assessment or if indications of a potential impairment exist, the determination of whether an impairment has occurred requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be assessed. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessments at least every three years. Under the qualitative assessment, we consider several factors, including the enterprise value of the reporting unit from the last quantitative test and the excess of fair value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of the reporting unit, as well as other factors. Under the quantitative assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using an average of the market approach and a discounted cash flow method, as a form of the income approach. The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples to complement discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two 45 Table of Contents components-projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit using the income approach is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represents our estimate of the WACC, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. The application of our goodwill impairment test requires key assumptions underlying our valuation model. The discounted cash flow analysis factors in assumptions on discount rates and terminal growth rates to reflect risk profiles of key strategic revenue and cost initiatives, as well as revenue and EBITDA growth relative to history and market trends and expectations. The market multiples approach reflects significant judgment involved in the selection of comparable public company multiples and benchmarks. The selection of companies and multiples is influenced by differences in growth and profitability, and volatility in market prices of peer companies. These valuation inputs are inherently judgmental, and an adverse change in one or a combination of these inputs could result in a goodwill impairment. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for our Consumer reporting unit. Our qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Consumer reporting unit in accordance with our policy. We applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting current assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates. Our assessment indicated that the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. In the event of a 10% decline in the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit, the fair value of the Consumer reporting unit would have still exceeded its book value. We do not believe reasonable changes in significant assumptions would change the outcome to this quantitative assessment. For instance, if either the terminal value growth rate declined by 50 bps or if the discount rate increased by 50 bps, the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit would still exceed its carrying value. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Business reporting unit given the low excess of fair value over carrying value identified in our 2022 annual impairment assessment and increased competitive and market pressures experienced throughout 2023. These pressures resulted in lower projected cash flows primarily driven by secular declines in wireline services and products across our Business customer groups. In connection with Verizon annual budget process in the fourth quarter of 2023, leadership completed a comprehensive five-year strategic planning review of our Business reporting unit resulting in declines in financial projections driven by market dynamics as compared to the prior year five-year strategic planning cycle. The revised projections were used as a key input into the Business reporting unit annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition, changes in the macroeconomic environment, including interest rate and inflationary pressures also impacted the fair value of the reporting unit. We applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting current assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates, which resulted in the determination that the fair value of our Business reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $5.8 billion ($5.8 billion after-tax) in our consolidated statement of income. The goodwill balance of the Business reporting unit was approximately $7.5 billion prior to the occurrence of this impairment charge. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Business reporting unit given the impairment of the Business reporting unit's goodwill in the prior year. In addition, the Business reporting unit has continued to experience competitive and market pressures throughout 2024, that may persist over the near term. We applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting current assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates, which indicated that the fair value of our Business reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. At the goodwill impairment measurement date of October 31, 2024, our Business reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 8% and remains susceptible to future impairment risk. We do not anticipate reasonable changes in significant assumptions to change the outcome of the quantitative impairment assessment. For instance, if either the terminal value growth rate declined by 50 bps, or if the discount rate increased by 50 bps, or if the EBITDA margin decreased by 100 basis points, the fair value of our Business reporting unit would still exceed its carrying value. However, management believes there is a continued risk that our Business reporting unit may be required to recognize an impairment charge in the future. As of December 31, 2024, $1.7 billion of goodwill was allocated to our Business reporting unit. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. A projected sustained decline in the reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair value and could result in future impairment charges. Such a decline could be driven by, among other things: (1) decreases in sales volumes or long-term growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; or (2) the reporting unit's inability to achieve or delays in achieving its goals or strategic initiatives. Adverse changes to macroeconomic factors, such as increases in long-term interest rates, would also negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans We maintain benefit plans for most of our employees, including, for certain employees, pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Benefit plan assumptions, including the discount rate used, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the determination of the substantive plan and health care trend rates are periodically updated and impact the amount of benefit plan income, 46 Table of Contents expense, assets and obligations. Changes to one or more of these assumptions could significantly impact our accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits. In determining pension and other postretirement obligations, the weighted-average discount rate was selected to approximate the composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at December 31, 2024. The bonds selected had maturities that coincided with the time periods during which benefit payments are expected to occur, were non-callable (or callable with certain selection criteria met) and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at least $300 million par outstanding). Bond yields are subject to uncertainty for a number of reasons including corporate performance, credit rating downgrades and upgrades, government fiscal policy decisions, and general market volatility. The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets used in determining Verizon pension and other postretirement obligations are based on expectations for future investment returns for the plans asset allocation. The rates are subject to uncertainty for a number of reasons including corporate performance, credit ratings, monetary policy, inflation, exchange rates, investor behavior and general market volatility. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets on the benefit obligations and expense (income) recorded, as well as an increase or a decrease in the actual versus expected return on plan assets as of December 31, 2024 and for the year then ended pertaining to Verizon pension and postretirement benefit plans, is provided in the table below. The amounts in the table below related to discount rate changes are gross impacts on benefit obligations and expense, and do not reflect changes in asset values as a result of interest rate changes, for which our pension plan is highly hedged. (dollars in millions) Percentage point change Increase/(Decrease) at December 31, 2024 Pension plans discount rate +0.50 $ (410) -0.50 451 Rate of return on pension plan assets +1.00 (78) -1.00 78 Postretirement plans discount rate +0.50 (450) -0.50 486 Rate of return on postretirement plan assets +1.00 (4) -1.00 4 In addition to our liability hedging assets, we also employ an interest rate hedging strategy to further minimize the impact of discount rate changes on the funded ratio of the pension plan. While the target hedge ratio varies depending on the funded status of the plan and the level of interest rates, the target hedge ratio was 60% at December 31, 2024, limiting volatility. The annual measurement date for both our pension and other postretirement benefits is December 31. We use the full yield curve approach to estimate the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. The full yield curve approach refines our estimate of interest cost by applying the individual spot rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date. These individual spot rates align with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments and therefore provide a more precise estimate of interest cost. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Income Taxes Our current and deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as in connection with the adoption of new accounting standards, changes in tax laws and rates, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and non-recurring items. As a global commercial enterprise, our income tax rate and the classification of income taxes can be affected by many factors, including estimates of the timing and realization of deferred income tax assets and the timing and amount of income tax payments. We account for tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance with the accounting standard relating to the uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We review and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on our best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at each reporting date. To the extent that the final outcome of these tax positions is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact income tax expense and actual tax payments. We recognize any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Actual tax payments may materially differ from estimated liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws as well as unanticipated transactions impacting related income tax balances. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Property, Plant and Equipment Our Property, plant and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets. We record property, plant and equipment at cost. We depreciate property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. The estimated useful life is subject to change due to a variety of factors such as change in asset capacity or 47 Table of Contents performance, technical obsolescence, market expectations and competitive impacts. In connection with our ongoing review of the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment during 2024, we determined that the estimated useful life of our property, plant and equipment would remain unchanged. We expect that a one year increase in estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment would result in a decrease to our 2024 depreciation expense of $2.4 billion and that a one year decrease would result in an increase of approximately $3.6 billion in our 2024 depreciation expense. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not expected to be recovered. The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for credit losses are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintain allowances for credit losses resulting from the expected failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management expectation of the asset collectability. The allowance is based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the credit quality of the customer base, the aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic conditions, as well as management expectations of conditions in the future, as applicable. The impact of these factors on the allowance involves significant level of estimation and is subject to uncertainty. Our allowance for credit losses is based on management assessment of the collectability of assets pooled together with similar risk characteristics. We record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is expected to be collectible. For device payment plan agreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance balance. The weighted-average expected loss r ate increased 0.75% at December 31, 2024 as compared to the rate at December 31, 2023. We expect that an increase or decrease of 0.25% in the weighted-average loss rate would result in a chan ge of $160 million in bad debt expense. We monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables are disaggregated and pooled by the following types of customers and related contracts: consumer, small and medium business, enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and is adjusted based on the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on management qualitative considerations. For enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-off experience and individual customer credit risk, if applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as discussed above. If there is a deterioration of our customers financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Acquisitions and Divestitures Spectrum License Transactions From time to time we enter into agreements to buy, sell or exchange spectrum licenses. We believe these spectrum license transactions have allowed us to continue to enhance the reliability of our wireless network while also resulting in a more efficient use of spectrum. In February 2021, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) concluded Auction 107 for C-Band wireless spectrum. In accordance with the rules applicable to the auction, Verizon is required to make payments for our allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction, which are estimated to be $7.5 billion. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made payments of $269 million, $4.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, for obligations related to clearing costs and accelerated clearing incentives. The carrying value of the wireless spectrum won in Auction 107 consists of all payments required to participate and purchase licenses in the auction, including Verizon allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction that we are obligated to pay in order to acquire the licenses, as well as capitalized interest to the extent qualifying activities have occurred. In March 2022, Verizon signed agreements with satellite operators in which operators agreed to clear C-Band spectrum in certain markets and frequencies ahead of the previously expected timeframe.
