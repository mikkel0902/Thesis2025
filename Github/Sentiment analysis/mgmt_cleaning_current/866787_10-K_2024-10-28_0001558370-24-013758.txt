Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We are the leading retailer and distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the Americas. We began operations in 1979 and at August 31, 2024, operated 6,432 stores in the U.S., 794 stores in Mexico and 127 stores in Brazil. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light duty trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products. At August 31, 2024, in 5,898 of our domestic stores as well as the vast majority of our stores in Mexico and Brazil, we had a commercial sales program that provided prompt delivery of parts and other products and commercial credit to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations, fleet owners and other accounts. We also sell automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products through www.autozone.com, and our commercial customers can make purchases through www.autozonepro.com. Additionally, we sell the ALLDATA brand of automotive diagnostic, repair, collision and shop management software through www.alldata.com. We also provide product information on our Duralast branded products through www.duralastparts.com. We do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services. Executive Summary For fiscal 2024, net sales increased to $18.5 billion, a 5.9% increase over the prior year. Our retail sales and commercial sales in our domestic and international markets grew as we continue to make progress on our growth initiatives aimed at improving parts availability and providing WOW! Customer Service. Operating profit increased 9.1% to $3.8 billion, net income increased 5.3% to $2.7 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 13.0% to $149.55 for the year. During fiscal 2024, failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix, at approximately 86% of total sales. While we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years, in our domestic stores we see a decrease in mix of sales of the discretionary category and a slight increase in the maintenance and failure categories compared to last year. Our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry, including but not limited to inflation, interest rates, levels of consumer debt, fuel and energy costs, prevailing wage rates, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, supply chain disruptions, hiring and other economic conditions. Given the nature of these macroeconomic factors, which are generally outside of our control, we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue, nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future. The two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the long-term are miles driven and the number of seven-year-old or older vehicles on the road. Miles Driven We believe as the number of miles driven increases, consumers vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance, resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items. Since the beginning of the fiscal year and through July 2024 miles driven in the U.S. increased 1.2% compared to the same period in the prior year based on the latest information available from the U.S. Department of Transportation. Seven Year Old or Older Vehicles As the number of seven-year-old or older vehicles on the road increases, we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell. We expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer. According to the latest data provided by S&P Global Mobility, the average age of light vehicles on the road was 12.6 years and these vehicles account for approximately 38% of U.S. vehicles. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, vehicles are driven an average of approximately 11,000 miles each year. In seven years, the average miles driven equates to approximately 77,000 miles. Our experience is that at this point in a vehicle life, most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance and repairs are needed to keep the vehicle operating. 27 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table highlights selected financial information over the past five years: Fiscal Year Ended August (in thousands, except per share data, same store sales and selected operating data) 2024 (1) 2023 2022 2021 (2) 2020 (2) Income Statement Data Net sales $ 18,490,268 $ 17,457,209 $ 16,252,230 $ 14,629,585 $ 12,631,967 Cost of sales, including warehouse and delivery expenses 8,673,216 8,386,787 7,779,580 6,911,800 5,861,214 Gross profit 9,817,052 9,070,422 8,472,650 7,717,785 6,770,753 Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses 6,028,344 5,596,436 5,201,921 4,773,258 4,353,074 Operating profit 3,788,708 3,473,986 3,270,729 2,944,527 2,417,679 Interest expense, net 451,578 306,372 191,638 195,337 201,165 Income before income taxes 3,337,130 3,167,614 3,079,091 2,749,190 2,216,514 Income tax expense (3) 674,703 639,188 649,487 578,876 483,542 Net income (3) $ 2,662,427 $ 2,528,426 $ 2,429,604 $ 2,170,314 $ 1,732,972 Diluted earnings per share (3) $ 149.55 $ 132.36 $ 117.19 $ 95.19 $ 71.93 Weighted average shares for diluted earnings per share (3) 17,803 19,103 20,733 22,799 24,093 Same Store Sales Increase in domestic comparable store net sales (4) 0.4 % 3.4 % 8.4 % 13.6 % 7.4 % Increase (decrease) in international comparable store net sales (4) 16.1 % 29.3 % 19.1 % 22.5 % (2.8) % Increase in international comparable store net sales (constant currency) (4) 10.2 % 17.5 % 19.2 % 20.7 % 4.7 % Increase in total company comparable store net sales (4) 2.1 % 5.6 % 9.2 % 14.3 % 6.6 % Increase in total company comparable store net sales (constant currency) (4) 1.4 % 4.6 % 9.2 % 14.1 % 7.2 % Balance Sheet Data Current assets $ 7,306,759 $ 6,779,426 $ 6,627,984 $ 6,415,303 $ 6,811,872 Operating lease right-of-use assets 3,057,780 2,998,097 2,918,817 2,718,712 2,581,677 Working capital (deficit) (5) (1,407,484) (1,732,430) (1,960,409) (954,451) 528,781 Total assets 17,176,538 15,985,878 15,275,043 14,516,199 14,423,872 Current liabilities 8,714,243 8,511,856 8,588,393 7,369,754 6,283,091 Debt 9,024,381 7,668,549 6,122,092 5,269,820 5,513,371 Finance lease liabilities, less current portion 283,882 200,702 217,428 186,122 155,855 Operating lease liabilities, less current portion 2,960,174 2,917,046 2,837,973 2,632,842 2,501,560 Stockholders deficit (4,749,614) (4,349,894) (3,538,913) (1,797,536) (877,977) Selected Operating Data Number of stores at beginning of year 7,140 6,943 6,767 6,549 6,411 New stores 217 198 177 219 138 Closed stores 4 1 1 1 Net new stores 213 197 176 218 138 Relocated stores 6 12 13 12 5 Number of stores at end of year 7,353 7,140 6,943 6,767 6,549 AutoZone domestic commercial programs 5,898 5,682 5,342 5,179 5,007 Total Company Store Data Inventory per store (in thousands) $ 837 $ 807 $ 812 $ 686 $ 683 Total AutoZone store square footage (in thousands) 49,417 47,899 46,435 45,057 43,502 Average square footage per AutoZone store 6,721 6,709 6,688 6,658 6,643 Increase in AutoZone store square footage 3.2 % 3.2 % 3.1 % 3.6 % 2.3 % Average net sales per AutoZone store (in thousands) $ 2,505 $ 2,435 $ 2,329 $ 2,160 $ 1,914 Net sales per AutoZone store average square foot $ 373 $ 363 $ 349 $ 325 $ 288 Total employees at end of year (in thousands) 126 119 112 105 100 Inventory turnover (6) 1.5x 1.5x 1.5x 1.5x 1.3x Accounts payable to inventory ratio 119.5 % 124.9 % 129.5 % 129.6 % 115.3 % After-tax return on invested capital (7) 49.7 % 55.4 % 52.9 % 41.0 % 35.7 % Adjusted debt to EBITDAR (8) 2.5 2.3 2.1 2.0 2.4 Net cash provided by operating activities (in thousands) (3) $ 3,004,116 $ 2,940,788 $ 3,211,135 $ 3,518,543 $ 2,720,108 Cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt (in thousands) (9) $ 1,791,635 $ 2,156,026 $ 2,599,636 $ 3,048,841 $ 2,185,418 Share repurchases (in thousands) (5)(10) $ 3,170,320 $ 3,723,289 $ 4,359,991 $ 3,378,321 $ 930,903 Number of shares repurchased (in thousands) (5) 1,149 1,524 2,220 2,592 826 28 Table of Contents (1) The fiscal year ended August 31, 2024 consisted of 53 weeks. (2) The 52 weeks ended August 28, 2021 and August 29, 2020 were negatively impacted by pandemic related expenses, including Emergency Time-Off of approximately $43.0 million (pre-tax) and $83.9 million (pre-tax), respectively. (3) Fiscal 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020 include excess tax benefits from stock option exercises of $81.4 million, $92.2 million, $63.2 million, $56.4 million, and $20.9 million, respectively. (4) The domestic and international comparable sales increases are based on sales for all AutoZone stores open at least one year. Constant currency same store sales exclude impacts from fluctuations of foreign exchange rates by converting both the current year and prior year international results at the prior year foreign currency exchange rate. Same store sales are computed on a 52-week basis. Relocated stores are included in the same store sales computation based on the year the original store was opened. Closed store sales are included in the same store sales computation up to the week it closes, and excluded from the computation for all periods subsequent to closing. All sales through our www.autozone.com website, including consumer direct ship-to-home sales, are also included in the computation. (5) During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company temporarily suspended share repurchases under the share repurchase program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which was restarted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. (6) Inventory turnover is calculated as cost of sales divided by the average merchandise inventory balance over the trailing 5 quarters. (7) After-tax return on invested capital is defined as after-tax operating profit (excluding rent charges) divided by invested capital (which includes a factor to capitalize leases). (8) Adjusted debt to EBITDAR is defined as the sum of total debt, finance lease obligations and annual rents times six; divided by net income plus interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (9) Cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt is defined as the change in cash and cash equivalents less the change in debt plus treasury stock purchases. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (10) Share repurchases are inclusive of excise tax in fiscal 2024 and 2023. The excise tax is assessed at one percent of the fair market value of net stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. 29 Table of Contents Fiscal 2024 Compared with Fiscal 2023 For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2024, we had net sales of $18.5 billion compared with $17.5 billion for the year ended August 26, 2023, an increase of 5.9%. This growth was driven primarily by the additional 53 rd week sales of $365.9 million, net sales of $292.4 million from new domestic and international stores and a n increase in total company same store sales of 1.4% on a constant currency basis. Domestic commercial sales increased $284.3 million, or 6.2%, over domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2023, driven in part by the additional 53 rd week sales of $95.7 million. Same store sales, or sales for our domestic and international stores open at least one year, are computed on a 52-week basis and are as follows: Fiscal Year Ended August Constant Currency (1) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Domestic 0.4 % 3.4 % 0.4 % 3.4 % International 16.1 % 29.3 % 10.2 % 17.5 % Total Company 2.1 % 5.6 % 1.4 % 4.6 % (1) Constant currency same store sales exclude impacts from fluctuations of foreign exchange rates by converting both the current year and prior year international results at the prior year foreign currency exchange rate. At August 31, 2024, we operated 6,432 domestic stores, 794 in Mexico and 127 in Brazil, compared with 6,300 domestic stores, 740 in Mexico and 100 in Brazil at August 26, 2023. We reported a total auto parts segment (domestic, Mexico and Brazil) sales increase of 5.9% for fiscal 2024. Gross profit for fiscal 2024 was $9.8 billion, or 53.1% of net sales, a 114 basis point increase compared with $9.1 billion, or 52.0% of net sales for fiscal 2023. The increase in gross margin was driven by higher merchandise margins and 47 basis points ($84.0 million net) from non-cash LIFO favorability. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2024 increased to $6.0 billion, or 32.6% of net sales, from $5.6 billion, or 32.1% of net sales for fiscal 2023. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by domestic store payroll. Interest expense, net for fiscal 2024 was $451.6 million compared with $306.4 million during fiscal 2023. Average borrowings for fiscal 2024 were $8.7 billion, compared with $7.0 billion for fiscal 2023. Weighted average borrowing rates were 4.39% and 3.78% for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective income tax rate was 20.2% of pre-tax income for both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023. The benefit from stock options exercised in fiscal 2024 was $81.4 million compared to $92.2 million in fiscal 2023 (see Note E Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Net income for fiscal 2024 increased by 5.3% to $2.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share increased 13.0% to $149.55 from $132.36 in fiscal 2023. The impact on the fiscal 2024 diluted earnings per share from stock repurchases was an increase of $0.96. Fiscal 2023 Compared with Fiscal 2022 A discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2022 has been omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K, but may be found in Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 26, 2023, filed with the SEC on October 24, 2023, which is available free of charge on the SECs website at www.sec.gov and at www.autozone.com, by clicking Investor Relations located at the bottom of the page. 30 Table of Contents Quarterly Periods Each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consisted of 17 weeks in 2024 and 16 weeks in 2023 and 2022. Because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks, compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters, our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of our annual net sales and net income. The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 represented 33.6% of annual sales and 33.9% of net income; the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 represented 32.6% of annual sales and 34.2% of net income; and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 represented 32.9% of annual sales and 33.3% of net income. Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts, products and accessories. We believe that our cash generated from operating activities, available cash reserves and available credit, supplemented with our long-term borrowings will provide ample liquidity to fund our operations while allowing us to make strategic investments to support growth initiatives and return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. As of August 31, 2024, we held $298.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, as well as $2.2 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility, without giving effect to commercial paper borrowings. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund our operations and investments to grow our business, repay our debt as it becomes due and fund our share repurchases over the short-term and long-term. In addition, we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary. Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.0 billion in 2024, $2.9 billion in 2023 and $3.2 billion in 2022. Cash flows from operations are favorable compared to last year primarily due to higher net income partially due to the additional week of sales in the current year. Our net cash flows used in investing activities were $1.3 billion, $876.2 million and $648.1 million in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures. We invested $1.1 billion, $796.7 million and $672.4 million in capital assets in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by our growth initiatives, including investments in new distribution centers and stores to be opened in subsequent periods as well as stores opened in the current year. We had net new store openings of 213, 197 and 176 for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable debt securities. We purchased marketable debt securities of $38.8 million, $66.9 million and $56.0 million in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We had proceeds from the sale of marketable debt securities of $40.8 million, $58.4 million and $53.9 million in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our investment in tax credit equity investments was $227.5 million, $98.0 million and $31.5 million in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was $1.7 billion, $2.1 billion and $3.5 billion in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock, which totaled $3.1 billion, $3.7 billion and $4.4 billion for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations and increased borrowings. During the year ended August 31, 2024, we repaid our $300 million 3.125% Senior Notes due April 2024 and issued $2.3 billion of new debt compared to $1.8 billion in 2023 and $750 million in 2022. In fiscal year 2024 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used to repay a portion of our commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. In fiscal years 2023 and 2022 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for general corporate purposes. The Company had net repayments of commercial paper and short-term borrowing of $629.6 million during fiscal 2024, and net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and short-term borrowings of $606.2 million and $603.4 million during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. 31 Table of Contents During fiscal 2025, we expect to increase the investment in our business as compared to fiscal 2024. Our investments are expected to be directed primarily to our supply chain initiatives, which include new distribution centers and new stores, including expanded hub stores and mega hub stores. The amount of investments in our new stores is impacted by different factors, including whether the building and land are purchased (requiring higher investment) or leased (generally lower investment) and whether such buildings are located in the U.S., Mexico or Brazil, or located in urban or rural areas. In addition to building and land costs, our new stores and distribution centers require working capital, predominantly for inventories. Historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers, reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio. We plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases; however, our ability to do so may be limited by our suppliers ability to factor their receivables from us. T he Company has arrangements with third-party financial institutions to confirm invoice balances owed by the Company to certain suppliers and pay the financial institutions the confirmed amounts on the invoice due dates. These arrangements allow the Company inventory suppliers, at their sole discretion, to enter into agreements with these financial institutions to finance the Company obligations to the suppliers at terms negotiated between the suppliers and the financial institutions. Supplier participation is optional and our obligations to our suppliers, including the amount and dates due, are not impacted by our suppliers decision to enter into an agreement with a third-party financial institution. A downgrade in our credit ratings or changes in the financial markets could limit the financial institutions and our suppliers willingness to participate in these arrangements. We plan to continue negotiating extended terms with our suppliers, benefitting our working capital and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio. We had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 119.5% at August 31, 2024 and 124.9% at August 26, 2023. Depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases. The balance may be funded through new borrowings. We anticipate we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past. Our cash balances are held in various locations around the world. As of August 31, 2024, and August 26, 2023, cash and cash equivalents of $99.8 million and $108.5 million, respectively, were held outside of the U.S. and were generally utilized to support the liquidity needs in our foreign operations. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2024, our adjusted after-tax return on invested capital ( ROIC ), which is a non-GAAP measure, was 49.7% as compared to 55.4% for the prior year. Adjusted ROIC is calculated as after-tax operating profit (excluding rent charges) divided by invested capital (which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases). We use adjusted ROIC to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance. Refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for further details of our calculation. Debt Facilities On November 15, 2021, we amended and restated our existing revolving credit facility (as amended from time to time, the Revolving Credit Agreement ) pursuant to which our borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement was increased from $2.0 billion to $2.25 billion, and the maximum borrowing under the Revolving Credit Agreement may, at our option, subject to lenders approval, be increased from $2.25 billion to $3.25 billion. On November 15, 2022, we amended the Revolving Credit Agreement, extending the termination date by one year. As amended, the Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate, and all amounts borrowed will be due and payable, on November 15, 2027, but we may make one additional request to extend the termination date for an additional period of one year . Revolving borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be base rate loans, Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ( SOFR ) loans, or a combination of both, at our election. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes (i) a $75 million sublimit for swingline loans, (ii) a $50 million individual issuer letter of credit sublimit and (iii) a $250 million aggregate sublimit for all letters of credit. 32 Table of Contents Under our Revolving Credit Agreement, covenants include restrictions on liens, a maximum debt to earnings ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances. As of August 31, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings and $1.8 million of outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2.5:1. This ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and rents to (ii) consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents. Our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of August 31, 2024 was 5.4:1. We also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of $25 million. The letter of credit facility is in addition to the letters of credit that may be issued under the Revolving Credit Agreement and had an expiration in June 2022. On May 16, 2022, we amended and restated the letter of credit facility to, among other things, extend the facility through June 2025. As of August 31, 2024, we had no letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility. In addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facility discussed above, we had $141.6 million in letters of credit outstanding as of August 31, 2024. These letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis. As of August 31, 2024, the $580 million of commercial paper borrowings, the $400 million 3.250% Senior Notes due April 2025 and the $500 million 3.625% Senior Notes due April 2025 were classified as long-term in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as we have the current ability and intent to refinance them on a long-term basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facility. As of August 31, 2024, we had $2.2 billion of availability under our Revolving Credit Agreement, without giving effect to commercial paper borrowings, which would allow us to replace these short-term obligations with a long-term financing facility. On April 18, 2024, we repaid the $300 million 3.125% Senior Notes due April 2024. On July 17, 2023, we repaid the $500 million 3.125% Senior Notes due July 2023. On January 17, 2023, we repaid the $300 million 2.875% Senior Notes due January 2023. On January 18, 2022, we repaid the $500 million 3.700% Senior Notes due April 2022, which were callable at par in January 2022. On June 28, 2024, we issued $600 million in 5.100% Senior Notes due July 2029 and $700 million 5.400% Senior Notes due July 2034 under our automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3, filed with the SEC on July 19, 2022 (File No. 333-266209) (the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement ). The 2022 Shelf Registration Statement allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital, capital expenditures, new store or distribution center openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings and for other general corporate purposes. On October 25, 2023, we issued $500 million in 6.250% Senior Notes due November 2028 and $500 million 6.550% Senior Notes due November 2033 under the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes. On July 21, 2023, we issued $450 million in 5.050% Senior Notes due July 2026 and $300 million in 5.200% Senior Notes due August 2033 under the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes. 33 Table of Contents On January 27, 2023 we issued $450 million in 4.500% Senior Notes due February 2028 and $550 million in 4.750% Senior Notes due February 2033 under the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes. On August 1, 2022, we issued $750 million in 4.750% Senior Notes due August 2032 under the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes. The Senior Notes contain a provision that repayment may be accelerated if we experience a change in control (as defined in the agreements). Our borrowings under our Senior Notes contain minimal covenants, primarily restrictions on liens, sale and leaseback transactions and consolidations, mergers and the sale of assets. All of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the applicable scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs. Interest is paid on a semi-annual basis. As of August 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants under our borrowing arrangements. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2024, our adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense ( EBITDAR ) ratio was 2.5:1 as compared to 2.3:1 as of the comparable prior year end. We calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt, finance lease liabilities and rent times six; and we calculate adjusted EBITDAR by adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense to net income. We target our debt levels to a specified ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings and believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels. To the extent adjusted EBITDAR increases, we expect our debt levels to increase; conversely, if adjusted EBITDAR decreases, we would expect our debt levels to decrease. Refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for further details of our calculation. Stock Repurchases During 1998, we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our Board of Directors (the Board ). The Board voted to increase the repurchase authorization by $2.0 billion on December 20, 2023 and $1.5 billion on June 19, 2024, bringing the total authorization to $39.2 billion. Previously, the Board voted to increase the authorization by $4.5 billion in fiscal 2023 and $5.0 billion in fiscal 2022. From January 1998 to August 31, 2024, we have repurchased a total of 155.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $37.0 billion. We repurchased 1.1 million, 1.5 million and 2.2 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $3.2 billion, $3.7 billion and $4.4 billion during fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Considering cumulative repurchases as of August 31, 2024 we had $2.2 billion remaining under the Board authorization to repurchase our common stock. We will continue to evaluate current and expected business conditions and adjust the level of share repurchases under our share repurchase program in a manner that is consistent with our capital allocation strategy or as we otherwise deem appropriate. Cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt was $1.8 billion, $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2024, August 26, 2023 and August 27, 2022, respectively. Cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt is calculated as the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents less net increases or decreases in debt (excluding deferred financing costs) plus share repurchases. We use cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt to calculate the cash flows remaining and available. We believe this is important information regarding our allocation of available capital where we prioritize investments in the business and utilize the remaining funds to repurchase shares, while maintaining debt levels that support our investment grade credit ratings. Refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for further details of our calculation. Subsequent to August 31, 2024 and through October 21, 2024, we have repurchased 67,677 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $212.0 million. Considering the cumulative repurchases through October 21, 2024, we have $2.0 billion remaining under the Board authorization to repurchase our common stock. 34 Table of Contents Financial Commitments The following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of August 31, 2024: Total Payment Due by Period Contractual Less than Between Between Over (in thousands) Obligations 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years Debt (1) $ 9,080,000 $ 1,480,000 $ 1,450,000 $ 2,000,000 $ 4,150,000 Interest payments (2) 2,198,888 375,625 653,775 527,550 641,938 Operating leases (3) 4,157,877 391,901 828,934 719,996 2,217,046 Finance leases (3) 461,654 116,999 209,841 92,389 42,425 Self-insurance reserves (4) 267,779 82,976 97,736 42,585 44,482 Construction commitments 103,780 103,780 Other (5) 49,259 49,259 $ 16,319,237 $ 2,600,540 $ 3,240,286 $ 3,382,520 $ 7,095,891 (1) Debt balances represent principal maturities, excluding interest, discounts, and debt issuance costs. (2) Represents obligations for interest payments on long-term debt. (3) Operating and finance lease obligations include related interest in accordance with ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). (4) Self-insurance reserves reflect estimates based on actuarial calculations and are presented net of insurance receivables. Although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, the timing of future payments are predictable based upon historical patterns. Accordingly, we reflect the net present value of these obligations in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. (5) Represents commitments to make additional capital contributions to certain tax credit instruments upon achievement of project milestones. Our tax liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, was $45.4 million at August 31, 2024. Approximately $23.1 million is classified as current liabilities and $22.3 million is classified as long-term liabilities. We did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments of the long-term liabilities due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of August 31, 2024: Total Other (in thousands) Commitments Standby letters of credit $ 143,393 Surety bonds 48,868 $ 192,261 A substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers compensation carriers. There are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The standby letters of credit and surety bond arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses. 35 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). These non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders value. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. However, we have presented the non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative year-to-year operating results. Furthermore, our management and Compensation Committee of the Board use the above-mentioned non-GAAP financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and use select measurements to determine payments of performance-based compensation. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the following reconciliation tables.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. In the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. Our senior management has identified self-insurance reserves as a critical accounting estimate that is materially impacted by assumptions and has discussed this policy with the Audit Committee of our Board. 38 Table of Contents Self-Insurance Reserves We retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation, general, product liability, property and vehicle liability; and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks. Our self-insurance reserve estimates totaled $257.7 million at August 31, 2024, and $268.8 million at August 26, 2023. Where estimates are possible, losses covered by insurance are recognized on a gross basis with a corresponding insurance receivable. The assumptions made by management in estimating our self-insurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience, judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels. We utilize various methods, including analyses of historical trends and use of a specialist, to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported. The actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. When estimating these liabilities, we consider factors, such as the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal costs associated with claims, healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors. In recent history, our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent, and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates. As we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred, we will adjust our reserves accordingly. Management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self- insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks. Arriving at these estimates, however, requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management, and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates. For example, changes in our assumptions about healthcare costs, the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness, the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary from our assumptions and estimates, causing our reserves to be overstated or understated. A 10% change in our self-insurance liability would have affected net income by approximately $18.8 million for fiscal 2024. Our liabilities for workers compensation, general and product liability, property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities; however, the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities. Accordingly, we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be long-term using the risk-free interest rate as of the balance sheet date. If the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 25 basis points, net income would have been affected by approximately $1.2 million for fiscal 2024.
