ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report. Overview We are a growing diagnostics company with proprietary molecular and bioinformatics technology that we are deploying to change the management of genetic disease worldwide. Our goal is to develop and commercialize non- or minimally-invasive tests to evaluate risk for a wide range of genetic conditions, such as Down syndrome, the results of which can enable early detection, diagnosis and treatment. Our technology has been proven clinically and commercially in the prenatal testing space. We have begun translating this success into the liquid biopsy space, where we are leveraging our core expertise to develop products for oncology diagnostic applications, and are also working to develop a transplant rejection test. We seek to enable even wider adoption of our technology through our global cloud-based distribution model. In addition to our direct sales force in the United States, we have a global network of over 100 laboratory and distribution partners, including many of the largest international laboratories. Since 2009, we have launched a comprehensive suite of thirteen products in reproductive health and prenatal testing 13 molecular diagnostic tests and a newborn stem cell banking offering to complement our prenatal testing portfolio as well as our offerings in oncology and transplant rejection, and our Constellation cloud-based platform. We generate a majority of our revenues from the sale of Panorama, our non-invasive prenatal test, or NIPT, which we commercially launched in March 2013. We launched our microdeletions panel for Panorama in 2014 and our twins, egg donor, and surrogate screening capabilities in 2017. We also generate a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of our Horizon Carrier Screening (HCS) test, which we launched in 2012. We launched our Constellation software platform, which forms the core of our cloud-based distribution model, in May 2015. In August 2017, we launched Signatera, a circulating tumor DNA technology that analyzes and tracks mutations specific to an individual tumor, for research use only by oncology researchers and biopharmaceutical companies. Signatera was commercially launched in May 2019 for clinical use as an LDT in our own CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratory. We received a final Medicare local coverage determination, or LCD, for Prospera in December 2019, covering all kidney transplant recipients, including those with multiple kidney transplants, and are working towards a full-scale commercial launch of Prospera in 2020. Our revenues were $302.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $257.7 million and $209.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We were formed in 2003 under our former name, Gene Security Network. From 2006 through 2013, the National Institutes of Health awarded us cumulative grants of $5.7 million to conduct various research projects including non-invasive aneuploidy screening on circulating fetal cells for prenatal diagnosis. An initial period of research and development was followed by the commercialization of Spectrum Preimplantation Genetic Screening in 2009 and Spectrum Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis in 2010; Anora Products of Conception (POC) in 2010; our non-invasive prenatal paternity test in 2011; Horizon Carrier Screening in 2012; Panorama NIPT in 2013; our microdeletions panel for Panorama in 2014; Constellation in 2015; Vistara, Signatera (RUO) and Panorama for twin pregnancies in 2017; and the CLIA version of Signatera in 2019. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we processed most of our tests in our laboratory certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, in San Carlos, California. A portion of our HCS and Vistara testing is performed by third-party laboratories. Our customers include independent laboratories, national and regional reference laboratories, medical centers and physician practices for our screening tests; and research laboratories and pharmaceutical companies for our Signatera technology. We market and sell our prenatal screening tests both through our direct sales force and through our laboratory distribution partners. We bill clinics, laboratory distribution partners, patients and insurance payers for the tests we perform. In cases where we bill laboratory distribution partners, our partners in turn bill clinics, patients and insurers. The majority of our revenue comes from insurers. Insurers with which we have in- 74 Table of Contents network contracts reimburse for NIPT procedures based on positive coverage determinations, which means that the insurer has determined that NIPT in general is medically necessary for this category of patient. In the United States, the majority of insurance providers provide positive NIPT coverage. As of December 31, 2019, we have in-network contracts with insurance providers that account for approximately 212 million covered lives in the United States. A "covered life" means a subscriber, or a dependent of a subscriber, who is insured under an insurance policy with the insurance carrier identified. The number of covered lives represented by insurers that have positive coverage determinations or with which we or our laboratory distribution partners have a contract provides a measure of our access to the healthcare market. Although our target market for NIPT is a much smaller subset of the total number of covered lives because it excludes subscribers for whom our NIPT would not be performed, such as men, children and post-menopausal women, we believe the number of U.S. covered lives for whom we have access under contract represents an important indicator of our access to the total available market for our products. Insurers also reimburse for our products through out-of-network claims submission processes where we do not have a contract with that insurer. The principal focus of our commercial operations currently is to distribute molecular diagnostic tests through our direct sales force, our laboratory distribution partners, and our Constellation licensees under our cloud-based distribution model. The number of tests that we accession is a key indicator that we use to assess our business. A test is accessioned when we receive the test at our laboratory, the relevant information about the test is entered into our computer system and the test sample is routed into the appropriate sample flow. This number is a subset of the number of tests that we process, which includes tests distributed through our Constellation licensees. The number of tests that we process is a key metric as it tracks overall volume growth, particularly as our laboratory partners may transition from sending samples to our laboratory to our cloud-based distribution model. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we processed approximately 804,300 tests, comprised of approximately 753,800 tests accessioned in our laboratory, compared to approximately 668,600 tests processed during the year ended December 31, 2018, comprised of approximately 625,900 tests accessioned in our laboratory; and approximately 515,200 tests processed during the year ended December 31, 2017, comprised of approximately 486,000 tests accessioned in our laboratory. This increase in volume represents continuous commercial growth of Panorama and HCS, both as tests performed in our laboratory as well as through our Constellation software platform. Prior to 2016, we experienced rapid growth in our U.S.-based internal sales force as part of our effort to increase the number of tests distributed through our direct sales force, because we generate a higher gross margin when we sell testing services directly. The percent of our revenues attributable to our U.S. direct sales force were 80%, 83% and 84% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The percent of our revenues attributable to U.S. laboratory partners for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 6%, which was up from 5% when compared to the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Our ability to increase our revenues and gross profit will depend on our ability to further penetrate the U.S. market with our direct sales force. The percent of our revenues attributable to international laboratory partners and other international sales for the years ended December 31, 2019 was 14%, up from 12% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 11% for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition to distributing molecular diagnostic tests to be performed at our laboratory, either directly or through our laboratory partners, we also establish licensing arrangements with laboratories under our cloud-based distribution model, whereby our laboratory licensees run the molecular workflows themselves and then access bioinformatics algorithms through our cloud-based Constellation software. This cloud-based distribution model results in lower revenues and gross profit per test than in cases where we process a test ourselves; however, because we don t incur the costs of processing the tests ourselves, our costs per test under this model are also lower. In February 2014, we entered into a licensing and service arrangement with a prenatal paternity licensee, to enable the development of a non-invasive prenatal paternity test based on our proprietary technology. The prenatal paternity licensee commercializes this test, and we receive royalty revenues from them. Starting the fourth quarter of 2015, we began entering into other licensing arrangements. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we have recognized revenues of $2.6 million, $2.4 million and $2.4 million from the prenatal paternity licensee arrangement, respectively. Regarding revenues recognized from our Constellation licensing arrangements, we have recognized $2.5 million, $2.4 million and $1.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In April 2017, we launched Evercord, a private cord blood and cord tissue processing and storage service. Our U.S. direct sales force sold Evercord to the same OB/GYNs who prescribe and ordered Panorama and HCS tests, and our 75 Table of Contents own inside sales force offered this product to our existing and past patients who have used our Panorama and HCS tests. Upon the launch of Evercord, we also entered into an agreement with a cord blood bank to perform processing and testing of cord blood and cord tissue units and to store those units at its facility. Our Evercord service included the provision of a collection kit and the collection, processing and storage of newborn cord blood and cord tissue units. Evercord customers paid a one-time fee for the processing of the units. Customers had the option to store their units under an annual plan, or to pre-pay for 18 years or the duration of their lifetime (for which we assume a useful life of 78 years); they also had the option to pay for storage in full at the time of collection of the unit, or over a period of six, 12, or 18 months. In September 2019, we sold the Evercord business for total estimated consideration of $15.4 million and recognized a gain of $14.4 million in our consolidated statement of operations. In May 2017, we launched Vistara, which is an NIPT that screens for single-gene disorders and offered as a complement to Panorama. Upon the launch of Vistara, we entered into an agreement with a laboratory partner to collaborate in improving test performance and to launch commercially. In August 2017, we launched Signatera, a circulating tumor DNA technology that analyzes and tracks mutations specific to an individual tumor, for research use only by oncology researchers and biopharmaceutical companies. Signatera was commercially launched in May 2019 for clinical use as an LDT in our own CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratory. In October 2017, we expanded our Panorama test to now screen twin pregnancies for zygosity and chromosomal abnormalities. In August 2019, we received a Medicare positive draft local coverage determination for certain forms of colorectal cancer. We received a final Medicare local coverage determination, or LCD, for Prospera in December 2019, covering all kidney transplant recipients, including those with multiple kidney transplants, and are working towards a full-scale commercial launch of Prospera in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, total revenues were $302.3 million, compared to $257.7 million and $209.6 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Revenues generated from our genetic testing accounted for $269.9 million or 89% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019; $240.4 million or 93% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018; and $203.8 million or 97% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, there were no customers exceeding 10% of the total revenues on an individual basis. Revenues from customers outside the United States were $41.5 million, representing 14% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, revenues from customers outside the United States were $31.7 million and $24.1 million, representing approximately 12% and 11%, respectively, of total revenues. Most of our revenues have been denominated in U.S. dollars, but we began to generate revenue in foreign currency in 2015, primarily denominated in Euros and Singapore Dollars. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were, respectively, $124.8 million, $128.2 million and $137.6 million. This included non-cash stock compensation expense of $28.6 million, $14.2 million and $11.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $699.2 million. Components of the Results of Operations The section of this Management Discussion and Analysis generally discusses year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. Discussions of year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Management Discussion and Analysis in Part II Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2019. Revenues We generate revenues from the sale of our genetic tests, primarily from the sale of our Panorama and HCS tests. Our two primary distribution channels are our direct sales force and our laboratory partners. In cases where we promote our tests through our direct sales force, we generally bill directly to a patient, clinic or insurance carrier, or a combination of the insurance carrier and patient for the fees. In cases where we sell our tests through our laboratory partners, the majority of our laboratory partners bill the patient, clinic or insurance carrier for the performance of our tests, and we are entitled to either a fixed price per test or a percentage of their collections. 76 Table of Contents Starting the fourth quarter of 2015, we began recognizing licensing revenues through the licensing and the provisioning of services to support the use of our proprietary technology by our cloud-based distribution model licensees. From the second quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2019, we recognized revenues from our Evercord offering. Sales of Panorama and HCS tests are recorded as product revenues. Revenues recognized from tests processed through our Constellation software platform, Evercord and Signatera (CLIA) revenues, and revenue recognized from the Qiagen LLC ( Qiagen ), BGI Genomics ( BGI ), and Foundation Medicine, Inc. ( FMI ) agreements (collectively the strategic partnership agreements ), and Signatera (RUO) are reported in licensing and other revenues. As of December 31, 2019, we have commercially launched 14 licensing and service arrangements with laboratories under our cloud-based distribution model from which we recognized revenue from in 2019. Prior to 2018, we recognized the majority of our revenues from contracts with insurance carriers upon receipt of cash due to limited historical experience and uncertainty in determining the amount of revenue and timing of collections. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue guidance, Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606 ), using the full retrospective approach. In accordance with ASC 606, the total consideration we expect to collect from insurance carriers, clinics, and patients in exchange for the goods and services provided is accrued in the period in which our tests are reported to customers. Due to potential future changes in insurance coverage policies, contractual rates, and other trends in the reimbursement of our tests, our collections may fluctuate significantly over time. Our ability to increase our revenues will depend on our ability to further penetrate the domestic and international markets and, in particular generate sales through our direct sales force, develop and commercialize additional tests, obtain reimbursement from additional third-party payers and increase our reimbursement rate for tests performed. In particular, our financial performance depends on reimbursement for Panorama in the average risk population and for microdeletions. The use of Panorama in the average risk population is not yet broadly reimbursed, although many third-party payers have begun to reimburse for this. Many third-party payers do not currently reimburse for microdeletions screening, as further discussed in the risk factor entitled Reimbursement and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business If we are unable to expand or maintain third-party payer coverage and reimbursement for Panorama and our other tests, or if we are required to refund any reimbursements already received, our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected , in part because there is currently limited published data on the performance of microdeletions screening tests. A new current procedure terminology, or CPT, code for microdeletions went into effect beginning January 1, 2017. We have experienced low average reimbursement rates thus far for microdeletions testing under this new code, and we expect that this new code will cause, at least in the near term, our microdeletions reimbursement to remain low, due to third-party payers declining to reimburse and through reduced reimbursement under the new code. This has had, and we expect it will continue to have, an adverse impact on our revenues. In addition, a new CPT code for expanded carrier screening went into effect beginning January 1, 2019, and has had, and may continue to have an adverse effect on our reimbursement rates for our broader Horizon carrier screening panel, for which we previously primarily received reimbursement on a per-condition basis, as those tests may be reimbursed as a combined single panel instead of as multiple individual tests. Because our revenues from Horizon continue to represent an increasing proportion of our overall revenues, a decline in our reimbursement rates for, and therefore our average selling price of, Horizon, could result in a decline in our overall revenue. Our financial performance is also impacted by having increased our in in-network coverage with third-party payers, which we believe is crucial to our growth and long-term success. However, because the negotiated fees under our contracts with third-party payers are typically lower than the list price of our tests, as we enter into additional in-network contracts with insurance providers, our average reimbursement per test decreases. While we expect the reduction in average reimbursement per test from in-network pricing to reduce our revenues and gross margins in the near term, in-network pricing is more predictable than out-of-network pricing, and we intend to continue to mitigate the impact by driving more business from our most profitable accounts. In addition, our strategy to offer our tests to laboratory licensees via our Constellation cloud-based software platform may also cause our revenues to decrease because we do not process the tests and perform the molecular biology analysis in our own laboratory under this model, and therefore are not able to charge as high an amount, and as a result realize lower revenues per test than when we perform the entire test ourselves. However, cost of licensing and other revenues for the Constellation software platform are relatively low, and therefore, its associated gross margin is higher. 77 Table of Contents Cost of Product Revenues The components of our cost of product revenues are materials and service costs, personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with testing samples, electronic medical record, order and delivery systems, shipping charges to transport samples, costs incurred from outsourcing our tests to third parties, and allocated overhead such as rent, information technology costs, equipment depreciation and utilities. Costs associated with performing tests are recorded when the test is accessioned. We expect cost of product revenues in absolute dollars to increase as the number of tests we perform increases. However, having rapidly achieved scale, we have increased our focus on more efficient use of labor, automation, and DNA sequencing. For example, we updated the molecular and bioinformatics process for Panorama to further reduce the sequencing reagents, test steps and associated labor costs required to obtain a test result, while increasing the accuracy of the test to allow it to run with lower fetal fraction input. These improvements also reduced the frequency of the need to require blood redraws from the patient. Cost of Licensing and Other Revenues The components of cost of licensing and other revenues are material costs associated with IVD kits sold to constellation clients, engineering costs incurred by the research and development team to improve and maintain the Constellation software platform, amortization of Constellation software development costs, development and support services relating to our strategic partnership agreements, and costs associated with specimens and Whole Exome Sequencing ( WES ) relating to our Signatera offering. Costs also include labor and other costs of development activities, collection kits consumed during the processing of cord blood samples, processing service and storage of the cord blood samples, and freight charged to transport the samples to the storage facility. Through the third quarter of 2019, cost of licensing and other revenues also includes costs associated with Evercord (see Note 13, Disposal of Business ). We currently have 14 revenue generating licensing and service agreements with laboratories and continue to have active discussions with many other potential licensees under our Constellation distribution model. We consider our cost of licensing and other revenues for the Constellation software platform to be relatively low, and therefore we expect its associated gross margin to be higher. Research and Development Research and development expenses include costs incurred to develop our technology, collect clinical samples and conduct clinical studies to develop and support our products. These costs consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense; prototype materials; laboratory supplies; consulting costs; regulatory costs; electronic medical record set up costs; and costs associated with setting up and conducting clinical studies at domestic and international sites and allocated overhead, including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing enhanced and new products. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses include executive, selling and marketing, legal, finance and accounting, human resources, billing and client services. These expenses consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense; direct marketing expenses; audit and legal expenses; consulting costs; training and medical education activities; payer outreach programs and allocated overhead, including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation, and utilities. 78 Table of Contents Gain on Disposal of Business In September 2019, we sold our Evercord business that provided cord tissue processing and storage services for total estimated consideration of $15.4 million, including $9.7 million in cash, $1.0 million of cash deposited in a third-party escrow account recorded in short-term other receivables, and $4.7 million of additional consideration. We recognized a gain of $14.4 million on the sale, which was included in loss from operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Interest Expense Interest expense is attributable to borrowing under our Credit Line and 2017 Term Loan, as well as the amortization of debt discount associated with the 2017 Term Loan. Interest Income and Other (Expense) Income, Net Interest income and other (expense) income, net is comprised of interest earned on our cash, realized gains and losses on investments, foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses, changes in the fair value of our warrants, and finance charges related to the unused borrowing capacity of our 2017 Term Loan. Critical Accounting Policies Our management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 in this Annual Report. Some of these accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the following critical accounting policies to reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements. On January 1, 2019, we adopted the new accounting requirements under ASC 842 using the modified retrospective approach, which now requires most leases to be recognized as right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities in the balance sheet. Upon adoption, we had three existing leases that were classified as operating leases, and the present value of their minimum future lease payments was determined by discounting the cash flows using the incremental borrowing rate with a term approximating the remaining term of each lease. We elected the optional transitional guidance under ASC 842 that allowed the initial recognition of the operating right-of-use assets and the corresponding lease liabilities as of January 1, 2019 instead of the earliest period presented. Effective January 1, 2019, we also transitioned to the new accounting requirements under Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) ASU 2018-07 for non-employee stock-based awards using the modified retrospective approach. The new guidance changes the fair value measurement requirements for our non-employee stock-based awards from remeasuring them at the end of each reporting period to a one-time measurement as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, while the method of recognizing the stock-based compensation remains unchanged. Starting January 1, 2019, we have elected to use expected term rather than remaining contractual term when determining the fair value of the non-employee awards, as well as the option to recognize actual forfeitures as they occur. Upon adoption, we recorded a $0.2 million cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance of accumulated deficit in the balance sheet. 79 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, using the full retrospective approach, which required us to record a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the earliest period presented in the consolidated financial statements. We recognize revenues when, or as, performance obligations in the contracts are satisfied, in the amount reflecting the expected consideration to be received from the goods or services transferred to the customers. Product Revenues Product revenues are derived from contracts with insurance carriers, laboratory partners and patients in connection with sales of prenatal genetic tests. The majority of our revenues is derived from Panorama NIPT, HCS, and to a lesser extent, other genetic tests. We enter into contracts with insurance carriers with primarily payment terms related to tests provided to the patients who have health insurance coverage. Insurance carriers are considered third-party payers on behalf of the patients, and the patients are considered the customers who receive genetic test services. Tests may be billed to insurance carriers, patients, or a combination of insurance carriers and patients. Further, we sell tests to a number of domestic and international laboratory partners and identify the laboratory partners as customers provided that there is a test services agreement between us and them. A performance obligation represents a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer, which represents a unit of accounting in accordance with ASC 606. A portion of the consideration should be allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. We evaluate our contracts with insurance carriers, laboratory partners and patients and identify a single performance obligation in those contracts, which is the delivery of the test results. The total consideration which we expect to collect in exchange for our products is an estimate and may be fixed or variable. Consideration includes reimbursement from both patients and insurance carriers, adjusted for variable consideration related to disallowed cases, discounts, refunds and doubtful accounts, and is estimated using the expected value approach. For insurance carriers with similar reimbursement characteristics, we use a portfolio of relevant historical data to estimate variable consideration and total collections for our products. We constrain the estimated variable consideration when we assess it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized may occur in future periods. The consideration expected from laboratory partners usually includes a fixed amount, but it can be variable depending on the volume of tests performed, and we determine the variable consideration using the expected value approach. For insurance carriers, laboratory partners and patients, we allocate the total consideration to a single performance obligation, which is the delivery of the test results to the customers. When assessing the total consideration for insurance carriers and patients, a certain percentage of revenues is further constrained for estimated refunds. We generally bill an insurance carrier, a laboratory partner or a patient upon delivery of test results. We also bill patients directly for out-of-pocket costs involving co-pays and deductibles that they are responsible for. Tests billed to insurance carriers and directly to patients usually take an average of nine to twelve months to collect the payments, and for tests billed to laboratory distribution partners, the average collection cycle takes approximately two to three months. At times, we may or may not get reimbursed for the full amount billed. Further, we may not get reimbursed at all for tests performed if such tests are not covered under the insurance carrier reimbursement policies or we are not a qualified provider to the insurance carrier, or if the tests were not previously authorized. Product revenue is recognized in an amount that equals the total consideration (as described above) at a point in time when the test results are delivered. We reserve certain amounts in other accrued liabilities on the balance sheet in anticipation of requests for refunds of payments previously made by insurance carriers, which are accounted for as reductions in product revenues in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. During the years ended December 80 Table of Contents 31, 2019 and 2018, $2.4 million and $3.3 million were released from amounts previously held in reserves in other accrued liabilities and recognized as product revenue. Licensing and Other Revenues We recognize licensing revenues from our Constellation cloud-based distribution model, pursuant to which we grant licenses to laboratories to access our proprietary bioinformatics algorithms through our cloud-based software to analyze the results of molecular workflows that such licensees perform in their laboratories. In addition, the royalties we receive from our arrangement with a prenatal paternity licensee are recognized Constellation revenues. We also recognize revenues from our Signatera (RUO) offering, which is for research use only to cancer researchers and biopharmaceutical companies. We enter into agreements with pharmaceutical companies to utilize the our Signatera tests typically to study new cancer treatments or to validate the outcomes of clinical trials for which the pharmaceutical companies are identified as customers. We also recognize revenues from our strategic partnership agreements (i.e., Qiagen, BGI, and FMI). The performance obligations are unique in each agreement and would typically require the license of intellectual property, development services, support services, and future test work. We recognized $16.4 million of revenues from strategic partnership agreements in the year ended December 31, 2019 (for details see Note 3, Revenue Recognition ). In addition, we recognize revenues from IVD Kits, and the Evercord offering for the processing and storage of newborn cord blood and cord tissue units through the third quarter of 2019. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740 ), which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of our future financial and operating activities. Under ASC 740, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the temporary difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect such differences to reverse. If we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize the value of some or all of our deferred tax assets (net of our deferred tax liabilities), we establish a valuation allowance offsetting the amount we do not expect to realize. We perform this analysis each reporting period and reduce our measurement of deferred taxes, if the likelihood we will realize them becomes uncertain. We also account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, which requires us to adjust our financial statements to reflect only those tax positions that are more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon review by federal or state examiners. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in 2019 and 2018 due to the uncertainty surrounding realization of these assets (for details, please refer to Note 14, Income Taxes ). In addition, our policy is to report interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expenses. 81 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation We have included stock-based compensation as part of our cost of revenues and our operating expenses in our statements of operations as follows: Year ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Employee Non-Employee Total Employee Non-Employee Total Employee Non-Employee Total (in thousands) Cost of revenues $ 905 $ 32 ` 937 $ 564 $ 5 $ 569 $ 544 $ $ 544 Research and development 5,354 5,354 4,043 4,043 3,214 3,214 Selling, general and administrative 21,730 603 22,333 9,474 112 9,586 7,644 7,644 Total $ 27,989 $ 635 $ 28,624 $ 14,081 $ 117 $ 14,198 $ 11,402 $ $ 11,402 Stock-based compensation related to stock options granted to our employees and non-employees is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award, which is determined by the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. No compensation cost is recognized on stock options for employees and non-employees who do not render the requisite service and therefore forfeit their rights to the stock options. The measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustments as the underlying equity instruments vest, and the resulting change in value, if any, is recognized in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the period that the related services are rendered. Impairment of Long-lived Assets We evaluate our long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We then compare the carrying amounts of the assets with the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over the asset fair value determined using discounted estimates of future cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2019, an asset impairment charge of $1.7 million was recorded in general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. This charge is comprised of $1.2 million from the impairment of leasehold improvements, $0.1 million from the impairment of capitalized software held for internal use, and $0.4 million from the right-of-use asset related to the disposal of business. The right-of-use asset and the leasehold improvements relate to the storage facility located in Tukwila, Washington, and both assets were evaluated for impairment as a single asset group. Subsequent to the sale of Evercord, we recognized an impairment charge for the leasehold improvements that was previously capitalized for the storage facility and wrote down the right-of-use asset to its fair value as of the sale date. We have marketed the leased location for subleasing. The impairment charge to capitalized software relate to an internally developed module that was solely used for the Evercord business and scrapped subsequent to the sale of Evercord. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded asset impairment charges totaling $1.5 million in research and development expenses in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. This charge was recorded to write off certain project development costs that were previously capitalized. 82 Table of Contents Results of operations Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 Year Ended December 31, Changes (in thousands) 2019 2018 2017 2019 - 2018 2018 - 2017 Amount Percent Amount Percent Revenues: Product revenues $ 269,881 $ 240,366 $ 203,777 $ 29,515 12.3 % $ 36,589 18.0 % Licensing and other revenues 32,447 17,288 5,848 15,159 87.7 11,440 195.6 Total revenues 302,328 257,654 209,625 44,674 17.3 48,029 22.9 Cost and expenses: Cost of product revenues 162,604 158,081 135,508 4,523 2.9 22,573 16.7 Cost of licensing and other revenues 12,866 7,974 4,088 4,892 61.3 3,886 95.1 Research and development 51,357 51,355 50,064 2 0.0 1,291 2.6 Selling, general and administrative 206,176 154,872 155,306 51,304 33.1 (434) (0.3) Gain on disposal of business (14,388) (14,388) * * Total cost and expenses 418,615 372,282 344,966 46,333 12.4 27,316 7.9 Loss from operations (116,287) (114,628) (135,341) (1,659) 1.4 20,713 (15.3) Interest expense (10,693) (10,476) (4,213) (217) 2.1 (6,263) 148.7 Interest and other (expense) income, net 4,152 (2,729) 2,380 6,881 (252.1) (5,109) (214.7) Loss before income taxes (122,828) (127,833) (137,174) 5,005 (3.9) 9,341 (6.8) Income tax expense (1,999) (321) (454) (1,678) 522.7 133 (29.3) Net loss $ (124,827) $ (128,154) $ (137,628) $ 3,327 (2.6) % $ 9,474 (6.9) % _______________________ * Not meaningful Revenues Total revenues are comprised of product revenues, which are primarily driven by sales of our Panorama and HCS tests, and licensing and other revenues, which include primarily of revenues from our strategic partnership agreements, Signatera (RUO) offering, licensing of our Constellation software to our licensees and revenues from the Evercord business. Total revenues increased by $44.7 million, or 17.3%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Product revenues During the year ended December 31, 2019, product revenues increased $29.5 million, or 12.3%, as a result of continued revenue growth in genetic test products such as Panorama and HCS. The number of Panorama and HCS tests accessioned continued to grow during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in the prior year by approximately 20%, and the resulting growth in revenues was partially offset by continued erosion in collection trends driven by factors such as prior authorization requirements by insurance carriers for an increasing proportion of our volumes. A portion of the net increase in Panorama and HCS revenues pertained to cumulative catch-up revenue adjustments totaling approximately $6.8 million recognized in the current period, due to collections from appeals on claims in the prior periods. Licensing and other revenues Licensing and other revenues increased $15.2 million, or 87.7%, during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase of $15.7 million from license and development services revenue from new strategic partnership agreements, $4.2 million increase of revenues from our other offerings 83 Table of Contents such as Evercord and oncology, and offset by a decrease in revenues from the Qiagen agreement by $5.2 million primarily due to upfront license revenues recognized in the year ended December 31, 2018, while no such revenues were recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019. We derive our revenues from tests based on units reported to customers tests delivered with a result. All reported units are either accessioned in our laboratory, processed outside of our laboratory, or processed as part of the Evercord offering. As noted in Overview, the number of tests that we process is a key metric as it tracks overall volume growth. During the year ended December 31, 2019, total reported units were approximately 763,900, comprising of approximately 718,500 tests reported in our laboratory. In addition, our ability to market and sell our tests outside of the United States has shown growth as revenues from customers outside the United States were $41.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cost of product revenues During the year ended December 31, 2019, cost of product revenues increased $4.5 million, or 2.9%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to $9.5 million of additional costs incurred from increased volume of tests accessioned such as inventory consumption and materials acquired for Panorama tests and our in-house HCS automation and $7.2 million increase attributable to labor and overhead allocation driven by resources dedicated to our HCS automation process and Panorama tests. In addition, overall shipping costs for our products increased by $0.8 million despite a large increase of reported units. This was offset by a decrease of $13.0 million of specimen fees paid to third parties primarily attributable to the HCS automation workflow. Cost of licensing and other revenues Cost of licensing and other revenues increased by $4.9 million, or 61.3%, during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to increased development and support efforts associated with license and test development services for our strategic partnership agreements, and internal and third-party provider costs incurred in connection with our oncology product offering that was launched in August 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2019, costs incurred for one of our strategic partnership agreements entered into in the second quarter of 2019 was $2.1 million and costs associated with a product offering launched in August 2017 increased by $4.3 million compared to $1.0 million in the same period prior year. The increase was offset by a $2.0 million decrease of cost associated with Evercord services due to the sale of this business in the third quarter of 2019. Research and development Research and development expenses remained flat in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily the result of a $2.1 million increase in research and development efforts for the commercialization of our Signatera cancer monitoring offering and our Prospera transplant rejection test due to higher salary and related expenses and employee benefits from increased headcount, offset by an impairment charge of $1.5 million recognized for writing off the project development costs previously capitalized in the year ended December 31, 2018, while no such impairment charge was incurred in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was further offset by a decrease in overall costs associated with clinical trials of $0.7 million. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $51.3 million, or 33.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The primary factors causing the increase were a $27.2 million increase in salaries and related expenses due to increase of $14.5 million resulting from increase in headcount across various selling, general and administrative departments and an increase of $12.7 million stock-based compensation expense resulting from performance- and market-based stock options and restricted stock units granted in the year ended December 31, 2019, changes in the fair value of the stock options and restricted stock units, and annual refreshers. Furthermore, we incurred an additional $9.2 million in outside services related to legal fees for litigation and patent defense, 84 Table of Contents international consultants, and SOX 404b implementation, $6.6 million in third-party billing, $3.5 million in overhead allocation, $3.4 million in travel related expenses, $1.2 million in employee recruiting costs, $1.1 million in bad debt expense, and offset by $0.9 decreases in other expenses. Gain on disposal of business Gain on disposal of business was by $14.4 million in the for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the gain on sale of Evercord. There was no such gain recorded in the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense Interest expense increased by $0.2 million, or 2.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The increase was the result of an increase in the average LIBOR for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period prior year. The Term Loan and Credit Line both have variable interest rates and subject to the fluctuations in the LIBOR. Interest and other (expense) income, net Interest and other income was $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to interest and other expense of $2.7 million in the same period of the prior year, which represented a net increase in expenses of $6.9 million. This increase in interest income was the result of a higher balance maintained in our investment portfolio resulting in an increase of $2.3 million of additional interest income and a charge in the second quarter of 2018 from the revaluation of the warrants to ROS Acquisition Offshore LP ( ROS ) upon exercise of $4.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have incurred net losses each year since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 we had net losses of $124.8 million and $128.2 million, respectively, and we expect to incur additional losses in the future as we continue to devote a substantial portion of our resources to our research and development and commercialization efforts of our existing and new products. As of December 31, 2019, we had $62.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, $379.1 million in marketable securities, $50.1 million of outstanding balance of the Credit Line including accrued interest, and $73.7 million of net of debt discount of the 2017 Term Loan. While we have introduced multiple products that are generating revenues, these revenues have not been sufficient to fund all operations. Accordingly, we have funded the portion of operating costs that exceeds revenues through a combination of equity issuances and debt and other financings. We expect to develop and commercialize future products and, consequently, we will need to generate additional revenues to achieve future profitability and may need to raise additional equity or incur additional debt. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders would experience dilution. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders and requires significant debt service payments, which diverts resources from other activities. Additional financing may not be available at all, or in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to delay the development and commercialization of our products and significantly scale back our business and operations. On April 23, 2019, we completed an underwritten equity offering to sell 5,263,158 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $19 per share. On April 26, 2019, we sold an additional 789,473 shares of our common stock to the underwriters at the same price upon their exercise of the option to purchase those shares. Before offering expenses of $0.6 million, we received proceeds of $108.1 million net of underwriting discount. On October 17, 2019, we completed an underwritten equity offering to sell 5,714,286 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $35 per share. On the same day, we sold an additional 857,142 shares of our common stock to the underwriters at the same price upon their exercise of the option to purchase those shares. Before offering expenses of $0.4 million, we received proceeds of $216.2 million net of the underwriting discount. 85 Table of Contents Based on our current business plan, we believe that our existing cash and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least 12 months after February 28, 2020. Credit Line Agreement In September 2015, we entered into the Credit Line with UBS providing for a $50.0 million revolving line of credit which can be drawn in increments at any time. The Credit Line was amended in July 2017 and bears interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 1.10%, and it is secured by a first priority lien and security interest in our money market and marketable securities held in our managed investment account with UBS. UBS has the right to demand full or partial payment of the Credit Line obligations and terminate it, in its discretion and without cause, at any time. 2017 Term Loan In August 2017, we entered into the 2017 Term Loan with OrbiMed, which had a maximum borrowing capacity of $100.0 million. On the closing date of August 8, 2017, we borrowed $75.0 million, with the remaining $25.0 million available to borrow at our option at any time through December 31, 2018, subject to standard conditions. The amounts borrowed under the 2017 Term Loan will primarily be used for general corporate purposes and to fund and support our business and operations. Interest accrues on the outstanding balance of the loan at a rate equal to the sum of (i) 8.75% plus (ii) the higher of 1.00% or LIBOR. The 2017 Term Loan has an 84-month term and will mature in August 2024. We are required to make interest payments on a quarterly basis, with repayment of the full outstanding balance on the maturity date. Our obligations under the 2017 Term Loan are secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property, subject to certain customary exceptions. On December 31, 2018, we amended certain terms in the 2017 Term Loan with OrbiMed. The amendment increased the existing unused borrowing capacity from $25.0 million to $50.0 million and extended the expiration date for the option to draw the unused borrowing capacity to March 31, 2019. If the aggregate principal amount drawn from the unused borrowing capacity is $50.0 million, the interest rate described above would instead decrease to the sum of (i) 8.25% plus (ii) the higher of 1.00% or LIBOR. If the amount drawn is less than $50.0 million, the interest rate would remain at the sum of (i) 8.75% plus (ii) the higher of 1.00% or LIBOR. In April 2019, we entered into a second amendment of the 2017 Term Loan with OrbiMed to further extend the expiration date until December 31, 2019 to draw the unused borrowing capacity of $50.0 million. In the second amendment, the interest rate is equal to the sum of (i) 8.25% plus (ii) the higher of 1.00% or LIBOR, provided we draw the minimum capacity of $25.0 million. If the amount drawn is less than $25.0 million, the interest rate would remain at the sum of (i) 8.75% plus (ii) the higher of 1.00% or LIBOR. As a fee in consideration of extending the commitment to provide this option to draw until December 31, 2019, we issued an additional 25,000 shares of our common stock to OrbiMed on April 29, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we did not exercise such option, and the right to draw the unused borrowing capacity has expired. 86 Table of Contents Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (in thousands) Cash used in operating activities $ (63,444) $ (70,581) $ (97,825) Cash (used in) provided by investing activities (266,353) (5,161) 13,784 Cash provided by financing activities 340,774 113,725 80,372 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 10,977 37,983 (3,669) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period 51,004 13,021 16,690 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of year $ 61,981 $ 51,004 $ 13,021 Cash Used in Operating Activities Cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $63.4 million.

We currently occupy approximately 136,000 square feet comprised of two office spaces (the First Space and the Second Space ). The First Space covers approximately 88,000 square feet, and the Second Space totals approximately 48,000 square feet. The term of this lease is approximately 84 months and expires in October 2023. This lease contains an option to renew the lease term for five years, but the fair market rent amount upon renewal is not available from the landlord. In addition, we entered into a sublease agreement in June 2019 with a third party to sublease 25,879 square feet of space located on the third floor of the San Carlos, California building while maintaining our primary obligation as the intermediate lessor. The term of this lease is approximately 48 months commencing in October 2019 and expiring in September 2023. The yearly lease payment starts at $1.9 million and will escalate annually starting in October 2020. In March 2018, we entered into a lease for its cord blood tissue storage facility in Tukwila, Washington that covers approximately 10,000 square feet. The lease term of this facility began in June 2018 with rent payment commencing in August 2018. The lease term is 62 months expiring in July 2023. We have the option to extend this lease for five years, and the fair market rent upon renewal is not determinable. However, since we sold our business related to cord blood and tissue storage in September 2019, it is expected we will sublet the facility and will not exercise our option to renew the facility upon expiration. In September 2015, our subsidiary entered into a long-term lease agreement for laboratory and office space totaling approximately 94,000 square feet in Austin, Texas. The lease term is 132 months beginning in December 2015 and expiring in November 2026 with monthly payments beginning in December 2016. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.
