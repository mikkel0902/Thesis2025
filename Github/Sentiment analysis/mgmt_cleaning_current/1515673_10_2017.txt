Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section of this Annual Report entitled “Selected Financial Data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and other parts of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. In this Annual Report, words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” and similar expressions (as well as other words or expressions referencing future events, conditions or circumstances) are intended to identify forward-looking statements, as described elsewhere herein. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.

Overview

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the identification, acquisition, development, and commercialization of novel products for the treatment of serious rare and ultra-rare diseases, with a focus on serious, debilitating genetic diseases. We target diseases for which the unmet medical need is high, the biology for treatment is clear, and for which there are no currently approved therapies. Since our inception in 2010, we have in-licensed potential treatments for multiple rare genetic disorders. Our strategy, which is predicated upon time- and cost-efficient drug development, allows us to pursue multiple programs in parallel with the goal of delivering safe and effective therapies to patients with the utmost urgency.

Our current clinical-stage pipeline consists of two product categories: biologics (including a monoclonal antibody and an enzyme replacement therapy); and small-molecule substrate replacement therapies. Enzymes are proteins that the body uses to process materials needed for normal cellular function, and substrates are the materials upon which enzymes act. When enzymes or substrates are missing, the body is unable to perform its normal cellular functions, often leading to significant clinical disease. Several of our therapies are intended to replace deficient enzymes or substrates.

Our biologics pipeline includes the following product candidates in clinical development for the treatment of three diseases:

 

•

KRN23, or UX023, is an antibody targeting fibroblast growth factor 23, or FGF23, in development for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia, or XLH, a rare genetic disease that impairs bone growth. We are developing KRN23 pursuant to our collaboration with Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., or KHK. KHK has completed one Phase 1 study, one Phase 1/2 study, and one longer-term Phase 1/2 study of KRN23 in adults with XLH. We initiated a Phase 2 pediatric study in July 2014 and a Phase 3 study in pediatric patients in October 2016. We also completed enrollment in a 134-patient Phase 3 adult study in July 2016. We expect data from this study in the first half of 2017. In January 2017, we and Kyowa Kirin International PLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of KHK, announced that we filed a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for the conditional marketing authorization of KRN23 for the treatment of XLH based on the Phase 2 data, and that the EMA validated the application. An opinion from Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, is expected in the second half of 2017.We plan to submit a biologics license application, or BLA to the FDA for KRN23 in the second half of 2017. Based on discussions with the FDA, our understanding is that the pediatric Phase 3 study is currently not expected to be required for a U.S. filing. We continue to discuss the details of the planned submission with the FDA.

 

•

KRN23 is also being developed for the treatment of tumor-induced osteomalacia, or TIO. TIO results from typically benign tumors that produce excess levels of FGF23, which can lead to severe hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia, fractures, fatigue, bone and muscle pain, and muscle weakness. We initiated a Phase 2 study of KRN23 in adult inoperable TIO patients in March 2015. We expect additional data from this study in the second half of 2017.

 

•

Recombinant human beta-glucuronidase, or rhGUS or UX003, is an enzyme replacement therapy we are developing for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis 7, or MPS 7, a rare lysosomal storage disease that often leads to multi-organ dysfunction, pervasive skeletal disease, and death. We have met with the FDA and the EMA and plan to submit regulatory filings in the first half of 2017 based on Phase 3 study results.

Our substrate replacement therapy pipeline includes the following product candidates in clinical development for the treatment of three diseases:

 

•

UX007 is a synthetic triglyceride with a specifically designed chemical composition being studied in an open-label Phase 2 study for the treatment of long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders, or LC-FAOD. LC-FAOD is a set of rare metabolic diseases that prevents the conversion of fat into energy and can cause low blood sugar, muscle rupture, and heart and liver disease. We are planning for a Phase 3 study that we expect to initiate in 2017 after discussions with regulatory authorities.

59

 

 

•

UX007 is also in a Phase 2 study for the treatment of glucose transporter type-1 deficiency syndrome, or Glut1 DS, a rare metabolic disease of brain energy deficiency that is characterized by seizures, developmental delay, and movement disorder. We expect data from the Phase 2 seizure study in the first quarter of 2017. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in the first quarter of 2017.

 

•

Aceneuramic acid extended-release, or Ace-ER or UX001, is an extended-release form of aceneuramic acid in a fully enrolled Phase 3 study for the treatment of GNE myopathy, a neuromuscular disorder that causes muscle weakness and wasting. Data from the Phase 3 study are expected in the second half of 2017. We filed a MAA, seeking conditional approval from the EMA for the use of Ace-ER in the treatment of GNE myopathy based on Phase 2 data. We withdrew this MAA in November 2016, after the CHMP indicated that the Phase 2 study was encouraging, but did not provide a sufficient amount of evidence to support an approval at that time.

Financial Operations Overview

We are a clinical-stage company and have only a limited operating history. To date, we have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in identifying, acquiring, and developing our product candidates, including conducting clinical studies and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have funded our operations primarily from the sale of equity securities.

We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our net losses were $245.9 million, $145.6 million and $59.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.

Revenue

We recorded $0.1 million in revenue for UX003 for the year ended December 31, 2016 for named patient sales in Europe. All of the costs to manufacture the associated inventory were expensed as incurred because the product is not approved for commercial sale. We do not expect to receive any significant product sales revenue until we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:

 

•

expenses incurred under agreements with clinical study sites that conduct research and development activities on our behalf;

 

•

expenses incurred under license agreements with third parties;

 

•

employee and consultant-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits, travel, and stock-based compensation;

 

•

laboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of preclinical, non-clinical, and clinical studies;

 

•

the cost of acquiring, developing, and manufacturing clinical study materials; and

 

•

facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, and other supply costs.

We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and clinical sites. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in future periods for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are then expensed as the related goods are delivered and the services are performed.

The largest component of our total operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities, including the clinical development of our product candidates. We allocate research and development salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, and indirect costs to our product candidates on a program-specific basis, and we include these costs in the program-specific expenses. We expect our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing our product candidates, and as programs advance into later stages of development and we enter into larger clinical studies. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain FDA approval is costly and time consuming and the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent, if any, we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates.

60

 

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, allocated facilities costs, and other expenses for outside professional services, including legal, human resources, audit, and accounting services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities, preparation for potential commercialization of our product candidates, and as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and those of any national securities exchange on which our securities are traded, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities, and other administration and professional services.

Interest Income

Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments.

Other Expense, net

Other expense, net primarily consists of foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Our foreign currency exchange gains and losses relate to transactions and asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates

Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We periodically review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. We believe the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments are as follows:

Accrued Research and Development, and Research and Development Expenses

As part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate and accrue expenses, the largest of which is related to accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs.

We record accruals for estimated costs of research, preclinical and clinical studies, and manufacturing development. These costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses. A substantial portion of our ongoing research and development activities is conducted by third-party service providers. We accrue the costs incurred under our agreements with these third parties based on actual work completed in accordance with agreements established with these third parties. We determine the actual costs through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrual balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accruals. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Our accrual is dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from clinical research organizations and other third-party vendors.

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist of salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation, lab supplies, materials and facility costs, as well as fees paid to other nonemployees and entities that conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf. Amounts incurred in connection with collaboration and license agreements are also included in research and development expense. Payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received.

To date, there have been no material differences from our accrued estimated expenses to the actual clinical trial expenses; however, due to the nature of estimates, we cannot assure you that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical studies and other research activities.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized once all revenue recognition criteria are met.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized revenue from sales of rhGUS (UX003) on a “named patient” basis, which are allowed in certain European countries prior to the commercial approval of the product in the territory. Due to our limited sales and collection history to date, revenue has been recognized upon receipt of payment.

Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees are measured at the date of grant based on the estimated fair value of the award, net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. We expect to continue to grant stock options in the future, and to the extent that we do, our actual stock-based compensation will likely increase. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions which determine the estimated fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include:

 

•

Expected term — The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term).

 

•

Expected Volatility—As we do not have sufficient historical stock price information to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards, our approach to estimating expected volatility is to phase in our own common stock trading history and supplement the remaining historical information with a blended volatility from the trading history from the common stock of the set of comparable publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies. When selecting comparable publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies on which to base the expected stock price volatility, we selected companies with comparable characteristics to us, including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. The historical volatility data was computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the stock-based awards. The average volatility for comparable publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants is used to supplement our historical volatility. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.

 

•

Risk-free interest rate — The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of option.

 

•

Expected dividend — We have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock. Therefore, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.

In addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation for our awards. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected terms, and forfeiture rates utilized for our stock-based compensation calculations on a prospective basis and will revise in subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 stock-based compensation expense was $48.3 million, $24.9 million and $5.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had $136.5 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation costs, net of estimated forfeitures, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.78 years.

Income Taxes

We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We assess the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

We recognize benefits of uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that such positions will be sustained upon examination based solely on their technical merits, as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon the ultimate settlement. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as a component of income tax expense or benefit. To date, there have been no interest or penalties charged in relation to the unrecognized tax benefits.

62

 

As of December 31, 2016, our total deferred tax assets were $212.4 million. Due to our lack of earnings history and uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The deferred tax assets were primarily comprised of federal and state tax net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to historical or future ownership percentage change rules provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before their utilization.

Research and development expenses increased $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in research and development expenses above is primarily due to:

 

•

for KRN23, an increase of $21.8 million related to the continued development of the XLH clinical program, including the enrollment of our Phase 3 adult study, the initiation of our Phase 3 pediatric study, the execution of our MAA filing, as well as continued clinical development and other regulatory activities for both the XLH and TIO clinical programs, net of KHK reimbursement;

 

•

for rhGUS, an increase of $10.7 million related to our Phase 3 and Under 5 studies in addition to increases in manufacturing-related and quality activities;

 

•

for UX007, an increase of $14.5 million related to clinical manufacturing, the continued development of our clinical Phase 2 program for LC-FAOD, study start-up activities for our Phase 3 clinical study for Glut1 DS, as well as patient identification efforts and support of investigator-sponsored studies across multiple diseases;

 

•

for Ace-ER, an increase of $8.4 million related to the enrollment of our Phase 3 study, and manufacturing, quality, patient identification, and regulatory activities for this program;

 

•

an increase of $13.0 million in other research and development costs including expenses in support of our clinical product candidate pipeline, expenses related to our research stage programs and research collaborations, and certain cost allocations, including stock compensation.

We expect our research and development expenses to increase in the future as we advance our product candidates through clinical development. The timing and amount of expenses incurred will depend largely upon the outcomes of current or future clinical studies for our product candidates as well as the related regulatory requirements, manufacturing costs and any costs associated with the advancement of our preclinical programs.

General and administrative expenses increased $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in commercial planning costs, professional services costs, stock-based compensation, and personnel costs resulting from an increase in the number of employees in support of our activities

We expect general and administrative expenses to increase to support our organizational growth and for our expected staged build out of our commercial organization over the next several years related to multiple late-stage product candidates.

Research and development expenses increased $68.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in research and development expenses above is primarily due to:

 

•

for KRN23, an increase of $8.2 million related to the continued development of the XLH clinical program, including the initiation of our Phase 3 adult study, the initiation of our adult TIO study, and other clinical development and regulatory activities, net of KHK reimbursement;

 

•

for rhGUS, an increase of $9.5 million related to an increase in manufacturing, quality, and clinical study related activities, including the enrollment of our Phase 3 study;

 

•

for UX007, an increase of $6.7 million related to clinical manufacturing and the continued development of our clinical program, including patient identification efforts, and support of investigator-sponsored studies across multiple diseases;

 

•

for Ace-ER, an increase of $13.3 million related to the increase in clinical, manufacturing, quality and regulatory activities for this program, including the initiation of our Phase 3 trial and efforts associated with the conditional MAA filing; and

 

•

an increase of $31.0 million in other research and development costs includes: $10.0 million for the Arcturus upfront license fee that was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $3.9 million related to the continued development of our pre-clinical programs, and an increase of $17.1 million in non-program specific support and overhead costs, including stock compensation expenses.

General and administrative expenses increased $22.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in commercial planning costs, professional services costs, stock-based compensation and personnel costs resulting from an increase in employees in support of our operations.

Other expense, net decreased $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. This was primarily related to the fair value remeasurement of the liability related to our convertible preferred stock warrants. There was no corresponding expense in 2015 as the preferred stock warrants were converted to common stock warrants upon the completion of the IPO and are no longer subject to remeasurement.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily with net proceeds from our equity financings. As of December 31, 2016, we had $498.1 million in available cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Our cash, cash equivalents and investments are held in a variety of interest-bearing accounts, corporate debt securities, U.S government securities and money market accounts. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with a view toward liquidity and capital preservation, and we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and credit risk.

Cash Used in Operating Activities

Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures. Due to our significant research and development expenditures, we have generated significant operating losses since our inception. Cash used to fund operating expenses is affected by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses.

65

 

Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $161.0 million and reflected a net loss of $245.9 million, offset by non-cash charges of $48.3 million for stock-based compensation, $4.8 million for the amortization of premium paid on purchased investments, $3.4 million for depreciation and amortization, $1.3 million for a foreign currency remeasurement loss due to an increase in foreign entity transactions and fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate during the period, and $0.7 million for the estimated fair value of a license fee in conjunction with the Takeda collaboration agreement. Cash used in operating activities also reflected a $7.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to an increase in prepaid manufacturing and an increase in receivables related to a tenant improvement allowance, and a $1.2 million increase in non-current assets as result of an increase in upfront payments to contract research organizations and in clinical study costs. These increases were offset by a $32.2 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities as a result of an accrual for a liability under a collaboration agreement, increase in clinical study, manufacturing, and related costs as we continued to increase our research and development activities and employee compensation in bonuses and vacation due to higher headcount, and a $2.5 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to increased spend and the timing of payments.

Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $106.0 million and reflected a net loss of $145.6 million, offset by non-cash charges of $1.4 million for depreciation and amortization, $5.6 million for the amortization of premium paid on purchased investments, and $24.9 million for stock-based compensation. Cash used in operating activities also reflected a $7.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to an increase in CRO prepaid clinical costs, an increase in KHK receivable and an increase in interest receivable, and a $2.0 million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to the timing of payments. These increases were offset by a $0.2 million decrease in non-current assets as result of a decrease in manufacturing prepaid expenses and a $16.7 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities as a result of an increase in clinical study, manufacturing, related costs as we continued to increase our research and development activities and employee bonuses.

Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $44.6 million and reflected a net loss of $59.8 million, offset by non-cash charges of $0.7 million for depreciation and amortization, $3.6 million for the amortization of premium paid on purchased short-term investments, $5.4 million for stock-based compensation and $3.3 million for the revaluation of convertible preferred stock warrant liability. Cash used in operating activities also reflected a $4.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to an increase in CRO prepaid expenses and an increase in interest income receivable as our invested funds increased with the closing of our IPO in February 2014 and our underwritten public offering in July 2014. Cash used in operations also reflected a $0.4 million increase in long-term other assets primarily from the increase in CRO prepaid expenses and value added tax receivables. These increases were offset by a $6.7 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily due to an increase in clinical study, manufacturing and related costs as we continued to increase our research and development activities.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $89.9 million and related to purchases of investments of $442.5 million, purchases of property and equipment of $10.2 million and an increase of $1.2 million in restricted cash for the expansion of the space under our current lease, offset by proceeds from maturities of investments of $403.2 million and the sale of investments of $140.6 million.

Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $292.4 million and related to purchases of investments of $624.2 million, purchases of property and equipment of $5.0 million and an increase of $1.5 million in restricted cash for the expansion of the space under our current lease, offset by proceeds from maturities of investments of $249.0 million and the sale of investments of $89.3 million.

Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $123.4 million and was related to purchases of short-term investments of $209.0 million and property and equipment of $2.1 million and an increase in restricted cash of $0.3 million for the expansion of the space under our current lease, offset by proceeds from maturities of short-term investments of $83.0 million, sales of investments of $5.0 million.

Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities

Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $138.7 million and was comprised of $79.5 million from the sale of common stock from our ATM offering, $51.4 million from the sale of common stock to Takeda, and $7.8 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units.

Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $467.6 million and was comprised of $461.1 million from our underwritten public offerings and $6.5 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and warrants and the vesting of restricted stock units.

Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $185.0 million and was comprised of $188.6 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our IPO and the underwritten public offering and $0.7 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and warrants, offset by the payment of a $4.3 million dividend to our preferred stockholders in connection with the closing of our IPO.

Funding Requirements

We anticipate that we will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, and begin to commercialize any approved products. We anticipate that we will require additional capital to fund our operations, complete our ongoing and planned clinical studies and commercialize our products, and funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. We expect to satisfy future cash needs through existing capital balances or, if necessary, through equity or debt financings, or strategic collaborations. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce the scope of, or terminate one or more of our clinical studies, research and development programs, future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the following:

 

•

the scope, rate of progress, results and cost of our clinical studies, nonclinical testing, and other related activities;

 

•

the cost of manufacturing clinical supplies, and establishing commercial supplies, of our product candidates and any products that we may develop;

 

•

the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue;

 

•

the cost, timing, and outcomes of regulatory approvals;

 

•

the cost and timing of establishing our commercial infrastructure, and distribution capabilities; and

 

•

the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, and other arrangements that we may establish, including any required upfront milestone and royalty payments thereunder.

We may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through some combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, and other marketing and distribution arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations and strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we do raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders’ rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.

Contractual Obligations

We have contractual obligations from our operating leases, manufacturing and service contracts, licenses, royalties, development and collaboration arrangements, and other research and development activities.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in a contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In March, April, May and December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations, ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients to provide supplemental adoption guidance and clarification to ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2014-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The effective date for these new standards is the same as the effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2014-09. We will early adopt the new revenue standard as of January 1, 2017 using a full retrospective application to each prior reporting period presented. We have substantially completed an assessment of the effect of the adoption of the new revenue standard. We do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires an entity that is a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. This guidance also requires disclosures about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, using a modified retrospective approach, and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payments, including income tax consequences, application of award forfeitures to expense, classification on the statement of cash flows, and classification of awards as either equity or liabilities. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. We are evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition method which is a cumulative-effective adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective reporting period. We are evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Since our inception in April 2010, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
