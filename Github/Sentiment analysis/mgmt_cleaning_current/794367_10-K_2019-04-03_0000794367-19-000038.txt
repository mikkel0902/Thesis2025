Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The discussion in this Item 7 should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The discussion in this Item 7 contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's plans, estimates and beliefs. The Company's actual results could materially differ from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. Company Overview The Company is an omnichannel retail organization operating stores, websites and mobile applications under three brands (Macy's, Bloomingdale's and bluemercury) that sell a wide range of merchandise, including apparel and accessories (men's, women's and kids'), cosmetics, home furnishings and other consumer goods. The Company operates 867 stores in 43 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam. As of February 2, 2019 , the Company's operations were conducted through Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Bloomingdale The Outlet, Macy Backstage, and bluemercury, which are aggregated into one reporting segment in accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 280, Segment Reporting. Bloomingdale's in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Al Zahra, Kuwait are operated under a license agreement with Al Tayer Insignia, a company of the Al Tayer Group, LLC. Strategic Initiatives and 2018 Summary The Company continues to implement its North Star strategy to transform its omnichannel business and focus on key growth areas, embrace customer centricity, and optimize value in its real estate portfolio. The components to this strategy are: 1. From Familiar to Favorite includes everything the Company does to further its brand awareness and identity to its core customers. Actions include understanding and anticipating customers needs, strengthening the Company's fashion authority and executing initiatives around its loyalty and pricing strategies. It celebrates the Company's iconic events and includes strategies to appeal to more value-oriented customers. 2. It Must Be Macy encompasses delivering the products and experiences customers love and are exclusive to the Company. This includes styles and home fashion for every day and special occasions, from the Company's leading private brands, as well as exclusive national brands or assortments. 3. Every Experience Matters , in-store and online. The Company's competitive advantage is the ability to combine the human touch in its physical stores with cutting-edge technology in its mobile applications and websites. Key to this point is the enhancement of a customer's experience as they explore the Company's stores, mobile applications and websites, find their favorite styles, sizes and colors, and receive their purchases through the shopping channels they prefer. 4. Funding our Future represents the decisions and actions the Company takes to identify and realize resources to fuel growth. This involves a focus on cost reduction and reinvestment as well as creating value from the Company's real estate portfolio. 5. What New, What Next explores and develops innovations to turn consumer and technology trends to the Company's advantage and to drive growth. This includes exploring previously unmet customer needs and making smart investment decisions based on customer insights and analytics. During 2018, the Company completed the foundational work for five key strategic initiatives underlying components of the North Star strategy. This activity resulted in positive contributions from each initiative during the fiscal year. The Macy's Star Rewards loyalty program marked its one-year anniversary and continued to offer improved benefits to its members, including exclusive experiences for the program's platinum loyalty members. Loyalty program members are shopping more and spending more in total, resulting in increased penetration of the Company's proprietary credit card. Additionally, a tender-neutral option was launched during 2018, resulting in the addition of more than three million new members to the loyalty program. Continuing the aggressive expansion of Backstage, Macy's mall-based off-price business, the Company opened more than 120 new Backstage locations within Macy stores. This expansion brings the total Backstage locations 18 to 172 (seven freestanding and 165 inside Macy's stores) as of February 2, 2019. The Company will expand to at least 45 more Backstage locations within Macy's stores in 2019. The Company enhanced customer options for pick-up, delivery and checkout at Macy's, including the expansion of Buy Online Pickup in Stores ("BOPS"), launch of Buy Online Ship to Store ("BOSS") and creation of At Your Service stations in all stores. The Company's vendor direct program (merchandise purchased from the Company's websites and digital applications and shipped directly to customers from the respective vendor) continued its expansion during 2018, with increased assortment and the addition of new categories and brands. This program will continue its expansion into more categories and brands in 2019. The Growth50 locations (a mix of stores where the Company accelerated a number of successful store initiatives, such as facility upgrades, merchandising strategies, and localized marketing) contributed to the strong operating results for 2018, with sales results outperforming the other Macy's locations. As a result of the performance of the Growth50 locations, the Company will expand the initiative to another 100 stores in 2019, creating the Growth150. 2018 was also a year of innovation. The Company acquired STORY and invested in b8ta to integrate in-store experiences with innovative technology and increase customer engagement. STORY is a concept store in New York City that reinvents itself every few weeks to attract new customers and retain existing ones. b8ta is a technology-powered retailer whose software platform provides an automated and seamless experience for emerging brands launching a physical retail presence. This technology platform allows the Company to implement its Market @ Macy's concept, also launched during 2018, across its store base at a faster pace. The Company also delivered the first national virtual reality roll-out in retail, opening over 100 virtual reality furniture galleries in 2018. The Company will carry three of its 2018 strategic initiatives forward into 2019 (Growth150, Backstage, and vendor direct) and will add two new initiatives: 1) the enhancement of the Company's mobile platforms and 2) investment in destination businesses comprising six merchandise categories (dresses, fine jewelry, big ticket, men's tailored, women's shoes and beauty). As part of the Company's commitment to increased productivity to fund investment in the business, in February 2019 the Company launched a comprehensive, multi-year program focused on growing its profitability rate by improving productivity across the enterprise. The program includes initiatives to improve margin through enhanced inventory planning and operations, supply chain efficiencies, pricing optimization, improved private brand sourcing and customer acquisition and retention strategies. As an initial step, the Company developed a plan in 2018 that reduces the complexity of the upper management structure to increase the speed of decision making, reduce costs and respond to changing customer expectations. Beginning in 2019, the Company expects the announced restructuring actions to generate annual expense savings of $100 million. In addition to the expected 2019 savings, the Company anticipates that these activities will fuel the productivity plan over the next three to five years and contribute significantly to profitable growth. For 2018, the Company recorded expense of approximately $80 million of severance and other human resource-related costs associated with these restructuring activities. In 2018, the Company continued to execute on its real estate strategy through both monetization and redevelopment of certain assets. Overall, the Company had asset sale gains of $389 million, totaling $474 million in cash proceeds in 2018. Included in these gains and proceeds are the sale of the former I. Magnin building in Union Square San Francisco, the sale of the upper seven floors of the Macy's State Street store in Chicago, as well as the continued recognition of the deferred gain from Macy's Brooklyn transaction executed in 2015. During 2018, the Company announced a retail store strategy for Macy's that focuses on identifying a scalable investment strategy for all of the brand's stores, improving the customer's experience and growing total sales profitably. This strategy includes categorization of the Company's Macy's stores into three groups: Flagship, Magnet and Neighborhood stores. Flagship stores include Herald Square and 10 other regional flagship stores which serve as premier retail destinations within their respective regions. Magnet stores are retail destinations within major markets that offer an expanded selection of merchandise. Included within these stores are the Growth50 stores, which, as noted previously, will be expanded to another 100 stores in 2019. 19 Neighborhood stores are smaller locations that are visited primarily for convenience and on-line order fulfillment. Bloomingdale's had a strong 2018, including an improved trend in stores performance and online growth. Notably, the renovation of Bloomingdale flagship store at 59 th Street brought new energy, products and experiences to this location, serving as a shopping destination for both locals and tourists. The Company continued its growth of its luxury beauty products and spa retailer, bluemercury, by opening additional freestanding bluemercury stores in urban and suburban markets and adding bluemercury products and boutiques to Macy's stores. As of February 2, 2019, the Company is operating 183 bluemercury locations (163 freestanding and 20 inside Macy's stores). In January 2019, the Company ended the joint venture with Fung Retailing Limited after winding down the operations of Macy's China Limited earlier in 2018. In conjunction with the termination of the joint venture, the Company acquired the noncontrolling interest in Macy's China Limited from Fung Retailing Limited, resulting in one hundred percent ownership. For the period of time prior to the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest, Fung Retailing Limited's thirty-five percent proportionate share of the results of Macy's China Limited was reported as noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview of 2018 Financial Results 2018 saw the execution of the Company's North Star strategy which resulted in healthier stores and continued e-commerce growth. 2018 ended with a solid fourth quarter and selected results of 2018 include: Net sales increased 0.1% compared to 2017, which included a 53rd week of operations.

Sales in 2018 were less strong in women's sportswear collections, handbags, fashion watches and color cosmetics. Sales of the Company's private label brands represented approximately 20% of net sales in the Macy's-branded operations in both 2018 and 2017. Credit Card Revenues, Net Net credit card revenues were $768 million for 2018 , an increase of $66 million compared to $702 million recognized in 2017 .

The cost of sales rate as a percent to net sales of 60.9% in 2018 was flat to 2017 , primarily due to lower merchandise costs, including lower markdowns, which offset higher delivery expenses associated with the Company's omnichannel activities, free shipping promotions and loyalty programs. Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses SG&A expenses for 2018 increased $85 million from 2017 and the SG&A rate as a percent to net sales increased 30 basis points to 36.2% as compared to 2017.

Settlement Charges $88 million and $105 million of non-cash settlement charges were recognized in 2018 and 2017, respectively. These charges relate to the pro-rata recognition of net actuarial losses associated with the Company defined benefit retirement 22 plans and are the result of an increase in lump sum distributions associated with retiree distribution elections and restructuring activity. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense, excluding losses and gains on early retirement of debt, for 2018 decreased $74 million from 2017 . This decrease was primarily driven by the reduction in the Company's debt resulting from the tender offer repurchases in 2017 and open market repurchases in 2018. Losses and Gains on Early Retirement of Debt In 2018, the Company repurchased approximately $344 million face value of senior notes and debentures and completed a tender offer debt repurchase of $750 million face value of senior notes and debentures.

As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a $10 million benefit related to the write-off of the unamortized premium associated with the debt repayments, net of the premium costs and other expenses. Effective Tax Rate The Company's effective tax rate was expense of 22.7% for 2018 and a benefit of 2.6% for 2017 . On a comparative basis, the 2018 rate reflects the Company's lower federal income tax statutory rate of 21% as compared to 35% resulting from the U.S. federal tax reform enacted in 2017. 2017 included the recognition of a non-cash tax benefit of $584 million associated with the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax balances due to U.S. federal tax reform.

By family of business, sales in 2017 were strongest in active apparel, fine jewelry, fragrances, dresses and men's tailored clothing. Sales in 2017 were less strong in handbags although the trend improved in the second half of the year. Sales of the Company's private label brands represented approximately 20% of net sales in the Macy's-branded operations in 2017 and 2016. Credit Card Revenues, Net Credit card revenues, net were $702 million for 2017 , an increase of $46 million compared to $656 million recognized in 2016. Increased proprietary card usage driven by the enhanced Macy's Star Rewards loyalty program drove the favorable results. Cost of Sales Cost of sales for 2017 decreased $485 million from 2016 . The cost of sales rate as a percent to net sales of 60.9% was 40 basis points higher in 2017 , as compared to 60.5% in 2016 , primarily due to higher delivery expenses associated with the Company's omnichannel activities and free shipping promotions. SG&A Expenses SG&A expenses for 2017 decreased $303 million from 2016 , however, the SG&A rate as a percent to net sales of 35.9% was 20 basis points higher in 2017 , as compared to 2016 . The dollar decrease from 2016 was mainly due to store closings and the restructuring activities announced in 2016 and 2017, offset slightly by higher expenses associated with the continued investments in the Company's omnichannel operations, and investments in bluemercury and Macy's Backstage. 23 Advertising expense, net of cooperative advertising allowances, was $1,108 million for 2017 compared to $1,153 million for 2016.

Benefit Plan Income, Net 2017 and 2016 included $57 million and $55 million , respectively, of non-cash net benefit plan income relating to the Company's defined benefit plans. This income includes the net of: interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs or credits and actuarial gains and losses. Settlement Charges $105 million and $98 million of non-cash settlement charges were recognized in 2017 and 2016, respectively. These charges relate to the pro-rata recognition of net actuarial losses associated with the Company defined benefit retirement plans and are the result of an increase in lump sum distributions associated with retiree distribution elections and restructuring activity. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense, excluding gains on early retirement of debt, for 2017 decreased $53 million from 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by the early repayment of $647 million of debt and the repayment at maturity of $300 million of debt in 2017. Gains on Early Retirement of Debt In 2017, the Company repurchased approximately $247 million face value of senior notes and debentures and completed a tender offer debt repurchase of $400 million face value of senior notes and debentures. As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a $10 million benefit related to the write-off of the unamortized premium associated with the debt repayments, net of the premium costs and other expenses. Effective Tax Rate The Company's effective tax rate was a benefit of 2.6% for 2017 and expense of 35.9% for 2016 . As previously discussed, 2017 differs from the federal income tax statutory rate of 33.7%, principally due to U.S. federal tax reform enacted in 2017 that led to the recognition of a non-cash tax benefit of $584 million associated with the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax balances. Further, 2017 included the recognition of approximately $15 million of net tax shortfalls associated with share-based payment awards. Net Income Attributable to Macy's, Inc. Shareholders Net income attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders for 2017 increased compared to 2016, driven by higher operating income due to higher asset sale gains, lower SG&A expenses, restructuring, impairment, store closing and other costs, partially offset by lower sales and gross margin. Coupled with higher credit card revenue, lower net interest expense and a net income tax benefit resulted in net income attributable to Macy's Inc. shareholders increasing by $939 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. 24 Guidance The Company's operations are impacted by competitive pressures from department stores, specialty stores, general merchandise stores, manufacturers' outlets, off-price and discount stores, online retailers, catalogs and television shopping, among others. The Company's operations are also impacted by general consumer spending levels, including the impact of general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability, cost and level of consumer debt, the costs of basic necessities and other goods and the effects of weather or natural disasters and other factors over which the Company has little or no control. In recent years, consumer spending levels have been affected to varying degrees by a number of factors, including modest economic growth, uncertainty regarding governmental spending and tax policies, unemployment levels, tightened consumer credit, and a fluctuating housing and stock market. In addition, consumer spending levels of international customers are impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. These factors have affected, to varying degrees, the amount of funds that consumers are willing and able to spend for discretionary purchases, including purchases of some of the merchandise offered by the Company. All economic conditions ultimately affect the Company's overall operations. However, the effects of economic conditions can be experienced differently and at different times, in the various geographic regions in which the Company operates, in relation to the different types of merchandise that the Company offers for sale, or in relation to each of the Company's branded operations. Based on its assessment of current and anticipated market conditions and its recent performance, the Company's 2019 guidance assumptions include the following: Net sales are estimated to be approximately flat to 2018. Comparable sales on both an owned and owned plus licensed basis are estimated to be flat to up 1.0%. Credit revenue is estimated to be approximately $740 million to $765 million. Gross margin rate is estimated to be down moderately in the first half and down slightly in the second half of the year. SG&A expense rate is expected to be up slightly with expense savings increasing throughout the year and helping to offset incremental investment spend. Benefit plan income is estimated to be approximately $25 million. Estimated asset sale gains of approximately $100 million. Estimated interest expense of approximately $190 million. Effective tax rate is expected to be 23.0%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be $3.05 to $3.25. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding asset sale gains, is expected to be $2.80 to $3.00. Estimated depreciation and amortization of approximately $975 million. Capital expenditures are estimated at approximately $1 billion. 25 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash on hand and the credit facility described below. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,735 million in 2018 compared to $1,976 million in 2017 . The decline was driven by lower earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and higher net inventory investment. These declines in operating cash flows were partially offset by lower cash paid for taxes in 2018 compared to 2017. Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities for 2018 was $456 million , compared to net cash used by investing activities of $351 million for 2017 . Investing activities for 2018 included purchases of property and equipment totaling $657 million and capitalized software of $275 million , compared to purchases of property and equipment totaling $487 million and capitalized software of $273 million for 2017 . Capital expenditures were higher by $172 million in 2018 as compared to 2017. This increase in capital expenditures was largely driven by the Company's Growth50 and Backstage strategic initiatives. In 2018, the Company continued to execute on its real estate strategy that includes creating value through monetization and, in some cases, redevelopment of real estate assets. Overall, property and equipment sales, primarily related to real estate, generated cash proceeds of $474 million in 2018 compared to $411 million in 2017. Financing Activities Net cash used by the Company for financing activities was $1,544 million for 2018 , including the repayment of $1,149 million of debt and the payment of $463 million of cash dividends, partially offset by the issuance of $45 million of common stock, primarily related to the exercise of stock options, and proceeds of $7 million received from Macy's China Limited's noncontrolling interest shareholder. During December 2018, the Company completed a tender offer and purchased $750 million in aggregate principal amount of certain senior unsecured notes and debentures. The purchased senior unsecured notes and debentures included $164 million of 6.65% senior debentures due 2024, $155 million of 7.0% senior debentures due 2028, $114 million of 6.9% senior debentures due 2029, $103 million of 4.5% senior notes due 2034, $94 million of 6.79% senior debentures due 2027, $35 million of 6.7% senior debentures due 2034, $34 million of 6.375% senior notes due 2037, $34 million of 6.7% senior debentures due 2028, $10 million of 6.9% senior debentures due 2032, $5 million of 8.75% senior debentures due 2029, and $2 million of 7.875% senior debentures due 2030. The total cash cost for the tender offer was $789 million. The Company recognized $28 million of expense related to the recognition of the tender premium and other costs partially offset by the unamortized debt premium associated with this debt. This expense is presented as losses on early retirement of debt on the Consolidated Statements of Income during 2018. During 2018, the Company repurchased $344 million face value of senior notes and debentures. The debt repurchases were made in the open market for a total cost of $354 million , including expenses and other fees related to the transactions. Such repurchases resulted in the recognition of expense of $5 million during 2018 presented as losses on early retirement of debt on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Net cash used by the Company for financing activities was $1,446 million for 2017 , including the repayment of $988 million of debt and the payment of $461 million of cash dividends, partially offset by the issuance of $6 million of common stock, primarily related to the exercise of stock options, and proceeds of $13 million received from Macy's China Limited's noncontrolling interest shareholder. During December 2017, the Company completed a tender offer and purchased $400 million in aggregate principal amount of certain senior unsecured notes and debentures. The purchased senior unsecured notes and debentures included $147 million of 6.9% senior debentures due 2032, $108 million of 6.7% senior debentures due 2034, $96 million of 6.375% senior notes due 2037, $43 million of 8.75% senior debentures due 2029, and $6 million of 7.875% senior debentures due 2030. The total cash cost for the tender offer was $423 million. The Company recognized $11 million of income related to the recognition of the unamortized debt premium partially offset by the tender premium and other costs 26 associated with this debt. This income is presented as gains on early retirement of debt on the Consolidated Statements of Income during 2017. In July 2017, the Company paid $300 million of debt at maturity. During the first and second quarters of 2017, the Company repurchased $247 million face value of senior notes and debentures. The debt repurchases were made in the open market for a total cash cost of $257 million , including expenses related to the transactions. Such repurchases resulted in the recognition of expense of $1 million during 2017 presented as losses on early retirement of debt on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company entered into a credit agreement with certain financial institutions as of May 6, 2016 providing for revolving credit borrowings and letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1,500 million (which may be increased to $1,750 million at the option of the Company, subject to the willingness of existing or new lenders to provide commitments for such additional financing) outstanding at any particular time. This agreement is set to expire May 6, 2021 and replaced the prior agreement which was set to expire May 10, 2018. As of February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018 , there were no revolving credit loans outstanding under this credit agreement, and there were no borrowings under the agreement during 2018 and 2017 . In addition, there were no standby letters of credit outstanding at February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018 . Revolving loans under the credit agreement bear interest based on various published rates. The Company is party to a $1,500 million unsecured commercial paper program. The Company may issue and sell commercial paper in an aggregate amount outstanding at any particular time not to exceed its then-current combined borrowing availability under the bank credit agreement with certain financial institutions. There were no borrowings under the program during 2018 and 2017. As of February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018, there were no remaining borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program. The credit agreement requires the Company to maintain a specified interest coverage ratio for the latest four quarters of no less than 3.25 and a specified leverage ratio as of and for the latest four quarters of no more than 3.75. The Company's interest coverage ratio for 2018 was 11.22 and its leverage ratio at February 2, 2019 was 1.74 , in each case as calculated in accordance with the credit agreement. The interest coverage ratio is defined as EBITDA divided by net interest expense and the leverage ratio is defined as debt divided by EBITDA. For purposes of these calculations EBITDA is calculated as net income plus interest expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment of goodwill, intangibles and real estate, non-recurring cash charges not to exceed in the aggregate $300 million and extraordinary losses less interest income and non-recurring or extraordinary gains. Debt is adjusted to exclude the premium on acquired debt and net interest is adjusted to exclude the amortization of premium on acquired debt and premium on early retirement of debt. A breach of a restrictive covenant in the Company's credit agreement or the inability of the Company to maintain the financial ratios described above could result in an event of default under the credit agreement. In addition, an event of default would occur under the credit agreement if any indebtedness of the Company in excess of an aggregate principal amount of $150 million becomes due prior to its stated maturity or the holders of such indebtedness become able to cause it to become due prior to its stated maturity. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders could, subject to the terms and conditions of the credit agreement, elect to declare the outstanding principal, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. Moreover, most of the Company's senior notes and debentures contain cross-default provisions based on the non-payment at maturity, or other default after an applicable grace period, of any other debt, the unpaid principal amount of which is not less than $100 million that could be triggered by an event of default under the credit agreement. In such an event, the Company's senior notes and debentures that contain cross-default provisions would also be subject to acceleration. At February 2, 2019 , no notes or debentures contain provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade. However, the terms of approximately $3,759 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company's senior notes outstanding at that date require the Company to offer to purchase such notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in specified circumstances involving both a change of control (as defined in the applicable indenture) of the Company and the rating of the notes by specified rating agencies at a level below investment grade. 27 As of February 2, 2019 , the Company had $1,716 million of authorization remaining under its share repurchase program. The Company may continue or, from time to time, suspend repurchases of shares under its share repurchase program, depending on prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital and other factors. On February 22, 2019, the Company's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 37.75 cents per share on its common stock, payable April 1, 2019, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2019. Contractual Obligations and Commitments At February 2, 2019 , the Company had contractual obligations (within the scope of Item 303(a)(5) of Regulation S-K) as follows: Obligations Due, by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years (millions) Short-term debt $ 42 $ 42 $ $ $ Long-term debt 4,671 1,092 1,150 2,429 Interest on debt 2,069 214 402 327 1,126 Capital lease obligations 46 3 6 6 31 Operating leases (a) 4,254 325 624 547 2,758 Letters of credit 28 28 Other obligations 5,022 3,188 825 299 710 $ 16,132 $ 3,800 $ 2,949 $ 2,329 $ 7,054 (a) Operating leases include executed leases not yet commenced. Other obligations in the foregoing table includes post employment and postretirement benefits, self-insurance reserves, group medical/dental/life insurance programs, merchandise purchase obligations and obligations under outsourcing arrangements, construction contracts, energy and other supply agreements identified by the Company and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that the Company expects to settle in cash in the next year excluding interest and penalties. The Company's merchandise purchase obligations fluctuate on a seasonal basis, typically being higher in the summer and early fall and being lower in the late winter and early spring. The Company purchases a substantial portion of its merchandise inventories and other goods and services otherwise than through binding contracts. Consequently, the amounts shown as Other obligations in the foregoing table do not reflect the total amounts that the Company would need to spend on goods and services in order to operate its businesses in the ordinary course. Of the Company's $149 million of unrecognized tax benefits at February 2, 2019, within "other obligations" in the foregoing table, the Company has excluded $4 million of deferred tax assets and $117 million of long-term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various tax positions taken. The table also excludes federal, state and local interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of $56 million. These liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations, and given the status of examinations, the Company cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Liquidity and Capital Resources Outlook Management believes that, with respect to the Company's current operations, cash on hand and funds from operations, together with its credit facility and other capital resources, will be sufficient to cover the Company's reasonably foreseeable working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements and other cash requirements in both the near term and over the longer term. The Company's ability to generate funds from operations may be affected by numerous factors, including general economic conditions and levels of consumer confidence and demand; however, the Company expects to be able to manage its working capital levels and capital expenditure amounts so as to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity. To the extent that the Company's cash balances from time to time exceed amounts that are needed to fund its immediate liquidity requirements, the Company will consider alternative uses of some or all of such excess cash. Such alternative uses may include, among others, the redemption or repurchase of debt, equity or other securities through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, and the funding of pension related obligations. Depending upon its actual and anticipated sources and uses of liquidity, conditions in the capital markets and other factors, the Company will from time to time consider the issuance of debt or other securities, or other possible capital markets transactions, for the purpose of raising capital which could be used to refinance current indebtedness or for other corporate 28 purposes including the redemption or repurchase of debt, equity or other securities through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, and the funding of pension related obligations. The Company intends from time to time to consider additional acquisitions of, and investments in, retail businesses and other complementary assets and companies. Acquisition transactions, if any, are expected to be financed from one or more of the following sources: cash on hand, cash from operations, borrowings under existing or new credit facilities and the issuance of long-term debt or other securities, including common stock. Important Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of the Company's financial information with additional useful information in evaluating operating performance. Management believes that providing supplemental changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis, which includes the impact of growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties, assists in evaluating the Company's ability to generate sales growth, whether through owned businesses or departments licensed to third parties, on a comparable basis, and in evaluating the impact of changes in the manner in which certain departments are operated. In addition, management believes that excluding certain items that are not associated with the Company's core operations and that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude period-to-period from diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders, EBIT and EBITDA, including as a percent to sales, provide useful supplemental measures that assist in evaluating the Company's ability to generate earnings and leverage sales, respectively, and to more readily compare these metrics between past and future periods. Management also believes that EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, and that such supplemental measures facilitate comparisons between companies that have different capital and financing structures and/or tax rates. In addition, management believes that ROIC is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating how efficiently the Company employs its capital. The Company uses some of these non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures for components of executive compensation. The reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure of changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis to GAAP comparable sales (i.e., on an owned basis) is in the same manner as illustrated below, where the impact of growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties is the only reconciling item. In addition, the Company does not provide the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure of diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy s, Inc. shareholders excluding certain items because the timing and amount of excluded items are unreasonably difficult to fully and accurately estimate. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the Company's actual and future financial condition and performance. Additionally, the amounts received by the Company on account of sales of departments licensed to third parties are limited to commissions received on such sales. The methods used by the Company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. 29 Changes in Comparable Sales The following is a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis, to GAAP comparable sales (i.e., on an owned basis), which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 2018 2017 2016 Increase (decrease) in comparable sales on an owned basis (note 1) 1.7 % (2.2 )% (3.5 )% Impact of growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties (note 2) 0.3 % 0.3 % 0.6 % Increase (decrease) in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis 2.0 % (1.9 )% (2.9 )% Notes: (1) Represents the period-to-period percentage change in net sales from stores in operation throughout the year presented and the immediately preceding year and all online sales, adjusting for the 53rd week in 2017, excluding commissions from departments licensed to third parties. Stores impacted by a natural disaster or undergoing significant expansion or shrinkage remain in the comparable sales calculation unless the store, or a material portion of the store, is closed for a significant period of time. Definitions and calculations of comparable sales differ among companies in the retail industry. (2) Represents the impact of including the sales of departments licensed to third parties occurring in stores in operation throughout the year presented and the immediately preceding year and all online sales, adjusting for the 53rd week in 2017, in the calculation of comparable sales. The Company licenses third parties to operate certain departments in its stores and online and receives commissions from these third parties based on a percentage of their net sales. In its financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP, the Company includes these commissions (rather than sales of the departments licensed to third parties) in its net sales. The Company does not, however, include any amounts in respect of licensed department sales (or any commissions earned on such sales) in its comparable sales in accordance with GAAP (i.e., on an owned basis). The amounts of commissions earned on sales of departments licensed to third parties are not material to its net sales for the periods presented. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Macy's, Inc. Shareholders The following is a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders, excluding certain items, to GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 2018 2017 2016 As reported $ 3.56 $ 5.10 $ 2.02 Restructuring, impairment, store closing and other costs (a) 0.41 0.61 1.54 Settlement charges 0.28 0.34 0.31 Losses (gains) on early retirement of debt 0.11 (0.03 ) Income tax impact of certain items identified above (0.18 ) (0.33 ) (0.73 ) Deferred tax effects of federal tax reform (1.90 ) As adjusted $ 4.18 $ 3.79 $ 3.14 Gains on sale of real estate (1.25 ) $ (1.77 ) (0.67 ) Income tax impact of gains on sale of real estate 0.33 $ 0.67 0.26 As adjusted excluding gains on sale of real estate $ 3.26 $ 2.69 $ 2.73 (a) 2018 excludes impairment, restructuring, and other costs attributable to the noncontrollling interest shareholder of $8 million. 30 Adjusted EBIT and EBITDA as a Percent to Net Sales The following is a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure EBIT and EBITDA, as adjusted to exclude certain items ("Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA"), as a percent to net sales to GAAP net income attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders as a percent to net sales, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 2018 2017 2016 (millions, except percentages) Net sales $ 24,971 $ 24,939 $ 25,908 Net income attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders $ 1,108 $ 1,566 $ 627 Net income attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders as a percent to net sales 4.4 % 6.3 % 2.4 % Net income attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders $ 1,108 $ 1,566 $ 627 Restructuring, impairment, store closing and other costs (a) 128 186 479 Settlement charges 88 105 98 Interest expense - net 236 310 363 Losses (gains) on early retirement of debt 33 (10 ) Federal, state and local income tax expense (benefit) 322 (39 ) 346 Adjusted EBIT $ 1,915 $ 2,118 $ 1,913 Adjusted EBIT as a percent to net sales 7.7 % 8.5 % 7.4 % Add back depreciation and amortization 962 991 1,058 Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,877 $ 3,109 $ 2,971 Adjusted EBITDA as a percent to net sales 11.5 % 12.5 % 11.5 % (a) 2018 excludes impairment, restructuring, and other costs attributable to the noncontrollling interest shareholder of $8 million. 31 ROIC The Company defines ROIC as adjusted EBITDA, excluding net rent expense, as a percent to average invested capital. Average invested capital is comprised of an annual two-point (i.e., end of the year presented and the immediately preceding year) average of gross property and equipment, a capitalized value of non-capitalized leases equal to periodic annual reported net rent expense multiplied by a factor of eight and a four-point (i.e., end of each quarter within the period presented) average of other selected assets and liabilities. The calculation of the capitalized value of non-capitalized leases is consistent with industry and credit rating agency practice and the specified assets are subject to a four-point average to compensate for seasonal fluctuations. The following is a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of ROIC to net income as a percent to property and equipment - net, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 2018 2017 2016 (millions, except percentages) Net income $ 1,098 $ 1,555 $ 619 Property and equipment - net $ 6,655 $ 6,845 $ 7,317 Net income as a percent to property and equipment - net 16.5 % 22.7 % 8.5 % Net income $ 1,098 $ 1,555 $ 619 Add back interest expense, net 236 310 363 Add back (deduct) losses (gains) on early retirement of debt 33 (10 ) Add back (deduct) federal, state and local tax expense (benefit) 322 (39 ) 346 Add back restructuring, impairment, store closing and other costs 136 186 479 Add back settlement charges 88 105 98 Add back depreciation and amortization 962 991 1,058 Add back rent expense, net Real estate 327 310 306 Personal property 9 10 11 Deferred rent amortization 14 14 9 Adjusted EBITDA $ 3,225 $ 3,432 $ 3,289 Property and equipment - net $ 6,655 $ 6,845 $ 7,317 Add back accumulated depreciation and amortization 4,553 4,733 5,088 Add capitalized value of non-capitalized leases 2,800 2,672 2,608 Add (deduct) other selected assets and liabilities: Receivables 273 327 402 Merchandise inventories 5,664 5,712 6,012 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 608 616 687 Other assets 803 830 881 Merchandise accounts payable (2,219 ) (2,115 ) (2,173 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (2,917 ) (3,127 ) (3,075 ) Total average invested capital $ 16,220 $ 16,493 $ 17,747 ROIC 19.9 % 20.8 % 18.5 % 32 Critical Accounting Policies Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, inventory is segregated into departments of merchandise having similar characteristics, and is stated at its current retail selling value. The retail inventory method inherently requires management judgments and estimates, such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow-moving inventory, which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margins. Permanent markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the utility of the inventory has diminished. Factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise and fashion trends. When a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise, the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded. Long-Lived Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges The carrying values of long-lived assets are periodically reviewed by the Company whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as historical operating losses or plans to close stores before the end of their previously estimated useful lives. Additionally, on an annual basis, the recoverability of the carrying values of individual stores is evaluated. A potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets. The estimate of cash flows includes management's assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations. When a potential impairment has occurred, an impairment write-down is recorded if the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. The Company believes its estimated cash flows are sufficient to support the carrying value of its long-lived assets. If estimated cash flows significantly differ in the future, the Company may be required to record asset impairment write-downs. If the Company commits to a plan to dispose of a long-lived asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life, estimated cash flows are revised accordingly, and the Company may be required to record an asset impairment write-down. Additionally, related liabilities arise such as severance, contractual obligations and other accruals associated with store closings from decisions to dispose of assets. The Company estimates these liabilities based on the facts and circumstances in existence for each restructuring decision. The amounts the Company will ultimately realize or disburse could differ from the amounts assumed in arriving at the asset impairment and restructuring charge recorded. Income Taxes Income taxes are estimated based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred income tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Uncertain tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Uncertain tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are then measured to determine the amount of benefit eligible for recognition in the financial statements. Each uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated and adjusted as appropriate, while taking into account the progress of audits of various taxing jurisdictions. Resolution of these matters could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's uncertain tax positions, provision for income taxes, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. Although the Company believes that its judgments are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company's historical income provisions and accruals. 33 Pension and Supplementary Retirement Plans The Company has a funded defined benefit pension plan (the Pension Plan ) and an unfunded defined benefit supplementary retirement plan (the SERP ). The Company accounts for these plans in accordance with ASC Topic 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits. Under ASC Topic 715, an employer recognizes the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognizes changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. Additionally, pension expense is generally recognized on an accrual basis over the average remaining lifetime of participants. The pension expense calculation is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 provides the funding requirements for the Pension Plan which are different from the employer's accounting for the plan as outlined in ASC Topic 715. No funding contributions were required, and the Company made no funding contributions to the Pension Plan in 2018 and 2017. As of the date of this report, the Company does not anticipate making funding contributions to the Pension Plan in 2019. Management believes that, with respect to the Company's current operations, cash on hand and funds from operations, together with available borrowing under its credit facility and other capital resources, will be sufficient to cover the Company's Pension Plan cash requirements in both the near term and also over the longer term. The calculation of pension expense and pension liabilities requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience may differ significantly from current expectations. The Company believes that the most critical assumptions relate to the long-term rate of return on plan assets (in the case of the Pension Plan) and the discount rate used to determine the present value of projected benefit obligations. The Company's assumed annual long-term rate of return for the Pension Plan's assets was 6.75% for 2018, and 7.00% for 2017 and 2016 based on expected future returns on the portfolio of assets. For 2019, the Company is lowering the assumed annual long-term rate of return to 6.50% based on expected future returns of the portfolio of assets. The Company develops its expected long-term rate of return assumption by evaluating input from several professional advisors taking into account the asset allocation of the portfolio and long-term asset class return expectations, as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Pension expense increases or decreases as the expected rate of return on the assets of the Pension Plan decreases or increases, respectively. Lowering or raising the expected long-term rate of return assumption on the Pension Plan's assets by 0.25% would increase or decrease the estimated 2019 pension expense by approximately $7 million. The Company discounted its future pension obligations using a weighted-average rate of 4.03% at February 2, 2019 and 3.74% at February 3, 2018 for the Pension Plan and 4.10% at February 2, 2019 and 3.78% at February 3, 2018 for the SERP. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the Company's Pension Plan and SERP obligations is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with various maturities. Each year's expected future benefit payments are discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate, thereby generating the overall discount rate for Pension Plan and SERP obligations. As the discount rate is reduced or increased, the pension liability would increase or decrease, respectively, and future pension expense would decrease or increase, respectively. Lowering the discount rates by 0.25% would increase the projected benefit obligations at February 2, 2019 by approximately $77 million and would decrease estimated 2019 pension expense by approximately $3 million. Increasing the discount rates by 0.25% would decrease the projected benefit obligations at February 2, 2019 by approximately $72 million and would increase estimated 2019 pension expense by approximately $3 million. The Company estimates the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for the Pension Plan and SERP. This method uses a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of net periodic benefit costs. Under this approach, the Company applies discounting using individual spot rates from the yield curve composed of the rates of return from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities available at the measurement date. These spot rates align to each of the projected benefit obligation and service cost cash flows.
