ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to the historical information, certain statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding forward-looking statements. Overview We own and operate a diversified entertainment platform, consisting of a portfolio of gaming assets that focus on resort casino operations and distributed gaming (including gaming in our branded taverns). We conduct our business through two reportable operating segments: Casinos and Distributed Gaming. In our Casinos segment, we own and operate ten resort casino properties in Nevada and Maryland. Our Distributed Gaming segment involves the installation, maintenance and operation of slots and amusement devices in non-casino locations such as restaurants, bars, taverns, convenience stores, liquor stores and grocery stores in Nevada and Montana, and the operation of branded taverns targeting local patrons located primarily in the greater Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area. On April 25, 2019, we issued $375 million of 2026 Notes in a private placement to institutional buyers at face value. The 2026 Notes bear interest at 7.625%, payable semi-annually on April 15th and October 15th of each year. See Note 8, Debt , in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. Casinos On January 14, 2019, we completed the acquisition of the Laughlin Entities from Marnell for $156.2 million in cash (after giving effect to the post-closing adjustment provisions in the purchase agreement) and the issuance by us of 911,002 shares of our common stock to certain assignees of Marnell. The Laughlin Acquisition added two resort casino properties in Laughlin, Nevada to our casino portfolio: the Edgewater and the Colorado Belle, which increase our scale and presence in the Southern Nevada market. The results of operations of the Laughlin Entities are included in our results subsequent to the acquisition date. See Note 4, Acquisitions , in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. On October 20, 2017, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of American for $787.6 million in cash (after giving effect to post-closing adjustments) and the issuance by us of approximately 4.0 million shares of our common stock to a former American equity holder. The American Acquisition added four Nevada resort casino properties to our casino portfolio, including The Strat in Las Vegas. The results of operations of American and its subsidiaries have been included in our results subsequent to that date. See Note 4, Acquisitions , in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 29 We own and operate ten resort casino properties in Nevada and Maryland .

As of December 31, 2019, in addition to hotel rooms and gaming in an 80,000 square foot casino, The Strat featured nine restaurants, two rooftop pools, a fitness center, retail shops and entertainment facilities. Arizona Charlie casinos : Our Arizona Charlie Decatur and Arizona Charlie Boulder casino properties primarily serve local Las Vegas patrons, and provide an alternative experience to the Las Vegas Strip. As of December 31, 2019, in addition to hotel rooms, gaming and bingo facilities, Arizona Charlie Decatur casino offered five restaurants and Arizona Charlie Boulder casino offered four restaurants and an RV park with approximately 220 RV hook-up sites. Laughlin casinos : We own and operate three casinos in Laughlin, Nevada, which is located approximately 90 miles from Las Vegas on the western riverbank of the Colorado River.

As of December 31, 2019, in addition to hotel rooms and gaming, Rocky Gap offered three restaurants, a spa and the only Jack Nicklaus signature golf course in Maryland. Rocky Gap is a AAA Four Diamond Award winning resort and includes an event and conference center. 30 Distributed Gaming Our Distributed Gaming segment involves the installation, maintenance and operation of slots and amusement devices in non-casino locations such as restaurants, bars, taverns, convenience stores, liquor stores and grocery stores in Nevada and Montana. We place our slots and amusement devices in locations where we believe they will receive maximum customer traffic, generally near a store entrance. In addition, we own and operate branded taverns with slots, which target local patrons, primarily in the greater Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area. As of December 31, 2019, our distributed gaming operations comprised approximately 10,900 slots in over 1,000 locations. Our branded taverns offer a casual, upscale environment catering to local patrons offering superior food, craft beer and other alcoholic beverages, and typically include 15 onsite slots. As of December 31, 2019, we owned and operated 66 branded taverns, which offered a total of over 1,000 onsite slots. Most of our taverns are located in the greater Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area and cater to local patrons seeking more convenient entertainment establishments than traditional casino properties. Our tavern brands include PT Gold, PT Pub, Sierra Gold, Sean Patrick s, PT Place, PT Ranch, Sierra Junction and SG Bar. Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Year Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2019 2018 2017 Revenues by segment Casinos $ 615,401 $ 513,949 $ 179,049 Distributed Gaming 357,239 337,067 327,506 Corporate and other 770 778 583 Total revenues 973,410 851,794 507,138 Operating expenses by segment Casinos 302,371 247,042 90,037 Distributed Gaming 275,104 263,953 255,621 Corporate and other 1,037 3,237 641 Total operating expenses 578,512 514,232 346,299 Selling, general and administrative 225,848 183,892 98,382 Depreciation and amortization 116,592 94,456 40,786 Acquisition and severance expenses 3,488 3,740 6,183 Preopening expenses 1,934 1,171 1,632 Loss on disposal of assets 919 3,336 441 Gain on contingent consideration (1,719 ) Other operating, net (157 ) Total expenses 927,293 800,827 491,847 Operating income 46,117 50,967 15,291 Non-operating expense, net (87,538 ) (62,242 ) (21,128 ) Income tax benefit (provision) 1,876 (9,639 ) 7,921 Net income (loss) $ (39,545 ) $ (20,914 ) $ 2,084 31 Year Ended December 31, 201 9 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 201 8 Revenues The $121.6 million, or 14%, increase in revenues resulted primarily from increases of $53.6 million, $32.5 million, $25.4 million and $10.1 million in gaming, food and beverage, room and other revenues, respectively, due primarily to the inclusion in 2019 of almost a full year of revenues from the resort casino properties acquired in the Laughlin Acquisition, the rebranding of The Strat, and growth in our tavern portfolio and Montana distribution gaming locations. The $101.5 million, or 20.0%, increase in revenues related to our Casinos segment compared to the prior year resulted primarily from increases of $37.4 million, $29.3 million, $25.4 million and $9.3 million in gaming, food and beverage, room and other revenues, respectively, due primarily to the inclusion in 2019 of almost a full year of revenues from the resort casino properties acquired in the Laughlin Acquisition and the rebranding of The Strat. The $20.2 million, or 6%, increase in revenues related to our Distributed Gaming segment resulted primarily from increases of $16.2 million, $3.1 million and $0.8 million in gaming revenues, food and beverage revenues and other revenues, respectively. These increases reflect the opening of six new taverns in the Las Vegas Valley in 2019, as a full year of revenues from the three taverns opened in 2018, stabilized performance of our Nevada distributed gaming locations and the increase of locations and slot product performance in our Montana distributed gaming locations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Adjusted EBITDA in our Casinos segment as a percentage of segment revenues (or Adjusted EBITDA margin) was 29%, compared to Adjusted EBITDA margin in our Distributed Gaming segment of 15%. The lower Adjusted EBITDA margin in our Distributed Gaming segment relative to our Casinos segment reflects the fixed and variable amounts paid to third parties under our space and revenue share agreements as expenses in the Distributed Gaming segment (which includes the percentage of gaming revenues paid to third parties under revenue share agreements). See Note 16, Segment Information , in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding segment Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of segment Adjusted EBITDA to segment net income (loss). Operating Expenses The $64.3 million, or 13%, increase in operating expenses compared to the prior year resulted primarily from $23.3 million, $21.6 million, $13.4 million and $6.0 million increases in gaming, food and beverage, room and other expenses, respectively. These operating expense increases primarily reflect the inclusion in 2019 of almost a full year of operating expenses relating to the resort casino properties acquired in the Laughlin Acquisition and the operating expenses of six new taverns, renovated food and beverage outlets at The Strat, and additional Montana distributed gaming locations. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The $42.0 million, or 23%, increase in selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses compared to the prior year resulted primarily from the inclusion in 2019 of almost a full year of SG&A expenses relating to the resort casino properties acquired in the Laughlin Acquisition and corporate related expenses. Within our Casinos segment, SG&A expenses increased $28.8 million, or 26%, resulting primarily from the inclusion in 2019 of almost a full year of SG&A relating to the resort casino properties acquired in the Laughlin Acquisition. The majority of the SG&A expenses in this segment comprised labor costs, marketing and advertising, utilities expenses, repairs and maintenance, and property taxes. Within our Distributed Gaming segment, SG&A expenses increased $4.8 million or 18%, primarily due to the opening of six new taverns in the Las Vegas Valley in 2019 as well as a full year of expenses from the three taverns opened in 2018. The majority of SG&A expenses in this segment comprised payroll and payroll taxes, marketing, building and rent expense, insurance and property taxes. 32 Corporate SG&A expenses increased $ 9.5 million, or 19 % compared to the prior year, primarily from labor costs and pr ofessional services in accounting. The majority of SG&A expense in this segment comprised of corporate office overhead, information technology, legal, accounting, third party service providers, executive compensation, share based compensation, payroll expe nses and payroll taxes . Acquisition and Severance Expenses Acquisition and severance expenses during the year ended December 31, 2019 related primarily to the Laughlin Acquisition, which closed on January 14, 2019 and subsequent integration activities. During the prior year, acquisition expenses primarily related to the American Acquisition and the Laughlin Acquisition. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses consist of labor, food, utilities, training, initial licensing, rent and organizational costs incurred. Non-capital costs associated with the opening of tavern and casino locations are also expensed as preopening expenses as incurred. During 2019 and 2018, preopening expenses related primarily to costs incurred in the opening of new taverns in the Las Vegas Valley. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $22.1 million, or 23%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the depreciation of the assets and the amortization of the intangibles acquired in the Laughlin Acquisition. Non-Operating Expense, Net Non-operating expense, net increased $25.3 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $10.2 million increase in interest expense from the higher level of indebtedness following the consummation of the Laughlin Acquisition, and a loss on change in fair value of derivative of $3.7 million. Non-operating expense, net in 2019 also included $5.5 million related to a loss on extinguishment of debt. Income Taxes Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $1.9 million, which resulted primarily from the change in valuation allowance. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $9.6 million, attributable primarily to the change in valuation allowance. The effective tax rate was 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019, which differed from the federal tax rate of 21% due primarily to the change in valuation allowance. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was (85.5)%, which differed from the federal tax rate of 21% due primarily to the change in valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2019, we evaluated all available positive and negative evidence related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets. We considered the expected future taxable income (and losses) and deductions from existing deferred tax assets and liabilities, net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and other factors in reaching the conclusion that the deferred tax assets are not currently expected to be realized, and that therefore, the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets required adjustment. The Company recognizes penalties and interest related to uncertain tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017 For a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, see Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 21, 2018. 33 Non-GAAP Measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), we use Adjusted EBITDA, a measure we believe is appropriate to provide meaningful comparison with, and to enhance an overall understanding of, our past financial performance and prospects for the future. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding specific expenses and gains that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. Further, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of operating performance used by management, as well as industry analysts, to evaluate operations and operating performance and is widely used in the gaming industry. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA is provided in the table below. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening expenses, acquisition and severance expenses, loss on disposal of assets, share-based compensation expenses, gain on contingent consideration, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain/loss on change in fair value of derivative, and other operating expenses. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA: Year Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2019 2018 2017 Net income (loss) $ (39,545 ) $ (20,914 ) $ 2,084 Depreciation and amortization 116,592 94,456 40,786 Preopening and related expenses (1) 4,548 1,171 1,632 Acquisition and severance expenses 3,488 3,740 6,183 Asset disposal and other writedowns 1,309 3,336 441 Share-based compensation 10,124 9,988 8,754 Other, net 2,216 1,088 1,460 Gain on contingent consideration (1,719 ) Interest expense, net 74,220 64,028 19,598 Loss on extinguishment of debt 9,150 1,708 Change in fair value of derivative 4,168 (1,786 ) (178 ) Income tax provision (benefit) (1,876 ) 9,639 (7,921 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 184,394 $ 164,746 $ 72,828 (1) Preopening and related expenses include rent, organizational costs, non-capital costs associated with the opening of tavern and casino locations, and expenses related to The Strat rebranding and the launch of the True Rewards loyalty program. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2019, we had $111.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. We currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements during the next 12 months. Our operating results and performance depend significantly on national, regional and local economic conditions and their effect on consumer spending. Declines in consumer spending would cause revenues generated in both our Casinos and Distributed Gaming segments to be adversely affected. 34 To further enhance our liquidity position or to finance any future acquisition or other business investment initiatives, we may obtain additional financing, which could consist of debt, convertible debt or equity financing from public and/or private credit and capital markets. In January 2018, the SEC declared our universal shelf registration statement effective for the future sale of up to $150.0 million in aggregate amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units and the resale of up to approximately 8.0 million shares of our common stock held by the selling security holders named therein. The securities may be offered from time to time, separately or together, directly by us or through underwriters, dealers or agents at amounts, prices, interest rates and other terms to be determined at the time of the offering. In January 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering pursuant to our universal shelf registration statement, in which certain of our shareholders resold an aggregate of 6.5 million shares of our common stock, and we sold 975,000 newly issued shares of our common stock. Our net proceeds from the offering were approximately $25.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. In April 2019, we issued $375 million of 2026 Notes in a private placement to institutional buyers at face value. The net proceeds of the 2026 Notes were used to (i) repay our former $200 million Second Lien Term Loan, (ii) repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility under our Credit Facility, (iii) repay $18 million of the outstanding term loan indebtedness under our Credit Facility, and (iv) pay accrued interest, fees and expenses related to each of the foregoing. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $113.9 million for the year end December 31, 2019 compared to $98.0 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the flow-through effect of higher revenues from the Laughlin Acquisition. Net cash used in investing activities was $256.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which included $107.3 million for capital expenditures and $149.0 million for the Laughlin Acquisition. Net cash used in investing activities was $69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which included $68.2 million for capital expenditures. Net cash provided by financing activities was $137.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which primarily related to $375.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes offset by $220.0 million of repayments under our Credit Facility. Net cash used in financing activities was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which primarily related to $19.6 million of stock repurchases authorized in November 2018 and $8.0 million of repayments under our Credit Facility, offset by $25.6 million of net proceeds to us in the underwritten public offering completed in January 2018. Senior Secured Credit Facility In October 2017, we entered into the Credit Facility, then consisting of a $800 million term loan and a $100 million revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility was subsequently increased from $100 million to $200 million in 2018. As of December 31, 2019, we had $772 million in outstanding term loan borrowings under the Credit Facility, no letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility, and our revolving credit facility was undrawn, leaving borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2019 of $200 million. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either (1) a base rate equal to the greatest of the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, the applicable administrative agent prime rate as announced from time to time, or the LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, subject to a floor of 1.75% (with respect to the term loan) or 1.00% (with respect to borrowings under the revolving credit facility) or (2) the LIBOR rate for the applicable interest period, subject to a floor of 0.75% (with respect to the term loan only), plus in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin for the term loan under the Credit Facility is 2.00% for base rate loans and 3.00% for LIBOR rate loans. The applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility ranges from 35 1.50% to 2.00% for base rate loans and 2.50% to 3.00% for LIBOR rate loans, based on our net leverage ratio . The commitment fee for the revolving credit facil ity is payable quarterly at a rate of 0.375% or 0.50%, depending on our net leverage ratio, and is accrued based on the average daily unused amount of the available revolving commitment. As of December 31, 2019, the weighted-average effective interest rate on our outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility was approximately 5. 3 %. The revolving credit facility matures on October 20, 2022, and the term loan under the Credit Facility matures on October 20, 2024. The term loan under the Credit Facility is repayable in 27 quarterly installments of $2 million each, which commenced in March 2018, followed by a final installment of $746 million at maturity. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by each of our existing and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (other than certain insignificant or unrestricted subsidiaries) and are secured by substantially all of the present and future assets of Golden and our subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain exceptions). Under the Credit Facility, we and our restricted subsidiaries are subject to certain limitations, including limitations on our respective ability to: incur additional debt, grant liens, sell assets, make certain investments, pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments. In addition, we will be required to pay down the term loan under the Credit Facility under certain circumstances if we or our restricted subsidiaries issue debt, sell assets, receive certain extraordinary receipts or generate excess cash flow (subject to exceptions). The revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant regarding a maximum net leverage ratio that applies when borrowings under the revolving credit facility exceed 30% of the total revolving commitment. The Credit Facility also prohibits the occurrence of a change of control, which includes the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of our capital stock (other than by certain permitted holders, which include, among others, Blake L. Sartini, Lyle A. Berman, and certain affiliated entities). If we default under the Credit Facility due to a covenant breach or otherwise, the lenders may be entitled to, among other things, require the immediate repayment of all outstanding amounts and sell our assets to satisfy the obligations thereunder. We were in compliance with our financial covenants under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2019. Senior Notes due 2026 On April 15, 2019, we issued $375 million of 2026 Notes in a private placement to institutional buyers at face value. The 2026 Notes bear interest at 7.625%, payable semi-annually on April 15th and October 15th of each year. In conjunction with the issuance of the 2026 Notes, we incurred approximately $6.7 million in debt financing costs and fees that have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the 2026 Notes using the effective interest method. The net proceeds of the 2026 Notes were used to (i) repay our former $200 million Second Lien Term Loan , (ii) repay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility under our Credit Facility, (iii) repay $18 million of the outstanding term loan indebtedness under the Credit Facility, and (iv) pay accrued interest, fees and expenses related to each of the foregoing. The 2026 Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time during the 12 months beginning on April 15, 2022 at a redemption price of 103.813%, during the 12 months beginning on April 15, 2023 at a redemption price of 101.906%, and at any time on or after April 15, 2024 at a redemption price of 100%, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date. Prior to April 15, 2022, we may redeem up to 40% of the 2026 Notes at a redemption price of 107.625% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date, from the net cash proceeds of specified equity offerings. Prior to April 15, 2022, we may also redeem the 2026 Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and an Applicable Premium (as defined in the Indenture), if any, thereon to the redemption date. 36 The 2026 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each o f our existing and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantees the Credit Facility. The 2026 Notes are our and the subsidiary guarantors general senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our respective exi sting and future unsecured unsubordinated debt. The 2026 Notes are effectively junior in right of payment to our and the subsidiary guarantors existing and future secured debt, including under the Credit Facility (to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt), are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities (including trade payables) of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 2026 Notes, and are senior in right of payment to all of our and the subsidiary guaran tors existing and future subordinated indebtedness. Under the Indenture, we and our restricted subsidiaries are subject to certain limitations, including limitations on our respective ability to: incur additional debt, grant liens, sell assets, make certain investments, pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments. In the event of a change of control (which includes the acquisition of more than 50% of our capital stock, other than by certain permitted holders, which include, among others, Blake L. Sartini, Lyle A. Berman, and certain affiliated entities), each holder will have the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of such holder 2026 Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. Expenses Related to Extinguishment and Modification of Debt In April 2019, we recognized a $5.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt and $3.7 million of expense related to modification of debt, related to the repayment of our Second Lien Term Loan and an $18 million prepayment of the term loan under our Credit Facility. Share Repurchase Program On November 7, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $25.0 million shares of common stock, subject to available liquidity, general market and economic conditions, alternate uses for the capital and other factors. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock in open market transactions for approximately $19.6 million at an average price of $16.06 per share. The November 7, 2018 authorization was replaced on March 12, 2019, when our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $25.0 million worth of additional shares of common stock, subject to available liquidity, general market and economic conditions, alternate uses for the capital and other factors. Share repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, block trades or in private transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws and regulations and other legal requirements, including compliance with our finance agreements. There is no minimum number of shares that we are required to repurchase and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. No shares were repurchased under our share repurchase program during the year ended December 31, 2019. Other Items Affecting Liquidity The outcome of the following specific matters, including our commitments and contingencies, may also affect our liquidity. Commitments, Capital Spending and Development We perform on-going refurbishment and maintenance at our facilities, of which certain maintenance costs are capitalized if such improvement or refurbishment extends the life of the related asset, while other maintenance costs that do not so qualify are expensed as incurred. The commitment of capital and the related timing thereof are contingent upon, among other things, negotiation of final agreements and receipt of approvals from the appropriate regulatory bodies. We intend to fund such capital expenditures through our revolving credit facility and operating cash flows. See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies , in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding commitments and contingencies that may also affect our liquidity. 37 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019: 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Term loan $ $ 4,000 $ 8,000 $ 8,000 $ 8,000 $ 744,000 $ 772,000 Senior Notes due 2026 375,000 375,000 Notes payable 4,835 1,495 25 14 6,369 Interest on long-term debt (1) 67,890 67,651 67,303 66,898 57,056 38,125 364,923 Operating leases (2) 45,171 43,653 37,218 31,540 30,490 101,441 289,513 Finance lease obligations (3) 4,442 3,953 2,617 529 227 3,828 15,596 Purchase obligations (4) 973 1,296 1,320 910 922 5,734 11,155 $ 123,311 $ 122,048 $ 116,483 $ 107,891 $ 96,695 $ 1,268,128 $ 1,834,556 (1) Represents estimated interest payments on our outstanding term loan balance based on interest rates as of December 31, 2019 until maturity.

(4) Represents obligations related to license agreements. Other Opportunities We may investigate and pursue expansion opportunities in our existing or new markets from time to time. Such expansions will be influenced and determined by a number of factors, which may include licensing availability and approval, suitable investment opportunities and availability of acceptable financing. Investigation and pursuit of such opportunities may require us to make substantial investments or incur substantial costs, which we may fund through cash flows from operations or borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility. To the extent such sources of funds are not sufficient, we may also seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings or from other sources. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that, if available, such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us. Moreover, we can provide no assurances that the investigation or pursuit of an opportunity will result in a completed transaction. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the application of the acquisition method of accounting, long-lived assets, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, revenue recognition, income taxes and share-based compensation expenses. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. The following represent our accounting policies that involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding our significant accounting policies. 38 Property and Equipment Property and equipment, net was $1,047 million as of December 31, 2019, comprising 60.1% of our consolidated total assets. We evaluate the carrying value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. If triggering events are identified, we then compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of such assets to the carrying value of the assets. Any such assets are not impaired if the undiscounted future cash flows exceed their carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, then an impairment charge is recorded, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model, which is based on the estimated future results of the relevant reporting unit discounted using our weighted-average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year free cash flow multiples. Property and equipment must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use the asset, a change in its physical condition, or an unexpected change in financial performance. We reconsider changes in circumstances on a frequent basis, as well as whenever a triggering event related to potential impairment has occurred. There are three generally accepted approaches available in developing an opinion of value: the cost, sales comparison and income approaches. We generally consider each of these approaches in developing a recommendation of the fair value of the asset; however, the reliability of each approach is dependent upon the availability and comparability of the market data uncovered, as well as the decision-making criteria used by market participants when evaluating an asset. We will bifurcate our investment and apply the most indicative approach to overall fair valuation, or in some cases, a weighted analysis of any or all of these methods. Given the need for significant judgements in conducting such valuations, we may engage the assistance of independent valuation firms. Goodwill We test our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each year, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level, and we consider each of our operating properties to be a separate reporting unit. When performing the annual goodwill impairment testing, we either conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired or elect to bypass this qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative test for impairment. Under the qualitative assessment, we consider both positive and negative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry events, financial performance and other changes, and make a determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the qualitative factors, we determine it is more likely than not the asset is impaired, we perform a quantitative test in which the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. When performing the quantitative test, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using the expected present value of future cash flows along with value indications based on our current valuation multiple and multiples of comparable publicly traded companies. The estimation of fair value requires management to make critical estimates, judgments and assumptions, including estimating expected future cash flows and selecting appropriate discount rates, valuation multiples and market comparables. Application of alternative estimates and assumptions could produce significantly different results. As of our 2019 annual goodwill testing date, the estimated fair values of each of our properties exceeded their respective carrying amounts. If the fair value of any of our properties should decline in the future, we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge, which could be material. A property fair value may decline as a result of a decrease in the property actual or projected operating results or changes in significant assumptions and judgments used in the estimation process, including the discount rate and market multiple. 39 Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Our indefinite-lived intangible assets include trade names and licenses. The fair value of our trade names is estimated using the income approach to valuation at each of our reporting units. We test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each year, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset is impaired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized unless it is determined that an asset useful life is no longer indefinite. We periodically review our indefinite-lived assets to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset no longer has an indefinite life, the asset is tested for impairment and is subsequently accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset. Finite-Lived Intangible Assets Our finite-lived intangible assets primarily represent assets related to our customer relationships, player relationships, non-compete agreements and leasehold interest, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. We periodically evaluate the remaining useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Lessee Arrangements We are the lessee under non-cancelable real estate leases, equipment leases and space agreements. Beginning on January 1, 2019 (the date of our adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-02, Leases ( Topic 842 )), operating lease right-of-use ( ROU ) assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date and initially measured based on the present value of lease payments over the defined lease term. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. We assess these options using a threshold of reasonably certain. For leases we are reasonably certain to renew, those option periods are included within the lease term and, therefore, the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, restrictions or covenants. Our lease agreements for land, buildings and taverns with lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately. The lease and non-lease components of certain vehicle and equipment leases are accounted for as a single lease component. Additionally, for certain vehicle and equipment leases, a portfolio approach is utilized to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, the incremental borrowing rate is estimated based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The implicit rate will be used when readily determinable. The operating lease ROU assets also include any prepaid lease payments made and are net of lease incentives. We do not record an asset or liability for operating leases with a term of 12 months or less. Prior to the adoption of Topic 842 on January 1, 2019, we did not record an asset or liability for any of our operating leases. Lessor Arrangements We are the lessor under non-cancelable operating leases for retail and food and beverage outlet space within our resort casino properties. The lease arrangements generally include minimum base rent and/or contingent rental clauses based on a percentage of net sales exceeding minimum base rent. Generally, the terms of the leases range between five and 10 years, with options to extend the leases. We record revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and recognizes revenue for contingent rentals when the contingency has been resolved. We have elected to combine lease and non-lease components for the purpose of measuring lease revenue. Revenue is recorded in other operating revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. 40 Acquisition Method of Accounting Accounting for acquisitions requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. The fair values of identifiable intangible assets are estimated using both the cost approach and an income approach, including the excess earnings, relief from royalty, cost savings method and the with-and-without methods. This requires significant estimates in determining the fair values, including market participant assumptions, projected financial information, estimates of expected cash flows, brand recognition, customer attrition rates and discount rates. Given the need for such significant judgments, we may engage the assistance of independent valuation firms. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but are inherently unpredictable and uncertain. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record measurement period adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred in our consolidated statement of operations. Revenue Recognition Revenue from contracts with customers primarily consists of casino wagers, room sales, food and beverage transactions, rental income from our retail tenants and entertainment sales. Casino gaming revenues are the aggregate of gaming wins and losses. The commissions rebated to premium players for cash discounts and other cash incentives to patrons related to gaming play are recorded as a reduction to casino gaming revenues. Gaming contracts include a performance obligation to honor the patron wager and typically include a performance obligation to provide a product or service to the patron on a complimentary basis to incentivize gaming or in exchange for points earned under our loyalty programs. We generally enter into three types of slot and amusement device placement contracts as part of our distributed gaming business: space agreements, revenue share agreements and participation agreements. Under space agreements, we pay a fixed monthly rental fee for the right to install, maintain and operate our slots at a business location. Under these agreements, we recognize all gaming revenue and record fixed monthly rental fees as gaming expenses. Under revenue share agreements, we pay the business location a percentage of the gaming revenue generated from our slots placed at the location and record that amount as an expense. With regard to both space and revenue share agreements, we hold the applicable gaming license to conduct gaming at the location (although revenue share locations are required to obtain separate regulatory approval to receive a percentage of the gaming revenue). Under participation agreements, the business location holds the applicable gaming license and retains a percentage of the gaming revenue that it generates from our slots, which we record as an expense. In Montana, our slot and amusement device placement contracts are all participation agreements. In our distributed gaming business, we consider our customers to be the gaming player since we control all aspects of the slot machines. Due to the maintaining of control of the services directly before they are transferred to the customer, we are considered to be the principal in these transactions and therefore record revenue on a gross basis. For wagering contracts that include complimentary products and services provided by us to incentivize gaming, we allocate the stand-alone selling price of each product and service to the respective revenue type. Complimentary products or services provided under our control and discretion that are supplied by third parties are recorded as an operating expense. For wagering contracts that include products and services provided to a patron in exchange for points earned under our loyalty program, True Rewards, we allocate the estimated stand-alone selling price of the points earned to the loyalty program liability. Upon redemption of loyalty program points for Golden-owned products and services, the stand-alone selling price of each product or service is allocated to the respective revenue type. For redemptions of points with third parties, the redemption amount is deducted from the loyalty program liability and paid directly to the third party. Any discounts received by us from the third party in connection with this transaction are recorded to other revenue. 41 After allocation to the other revenue types for products and services provided to patrons as part of a wagering contract, the residual amount is recorded to casino gaming revenue as soon as the wager is settled. As all wagers have similar characteristics, we account for our gaming contracts collectively on a portfolio basis. Revenue from leases is primarily recorded to other revenues and is generated from base rents through long-term leases with retail tenants. Base rent, adjusted for contractual escalations, is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the term of the related lease. Overage rent is paid by a tenant when its sales exceed an agreed upon minimum amount and is not recognized by us until the threshold is met. Food, beverage, and retail revenues are recorded at the time of sale. Room revenue is recorded at the time of occupancy. Sales taxes and surcharges collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements. Regulation and Taxes The casino and distributed gaming industries are subject to extensive regulation by state gaming authorities. Changes in applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. The gaming industry represents a significant source of tax revenues to regulators. From time to time, various federal and state legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax law, or in the administration of such law, affecting the gaming industry. It is not possible to determine the likelihood of possible changes in tax law or in the administration of such law. Such changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. See the Regulation section included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of applicable regulations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 42
