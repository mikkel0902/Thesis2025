Introduction Landstar System, Inc. and its subsidiary, Landstar System Holdings, Inc. (together, referred to herein as Landstar or the Company ), is a worldwide asset-light provider of integrated transportation management solutions. The Company offers services to its customers across multiple transportation modes, with the ability to arrange for individual shipments of freight to enterprise-wide solutions to manage all of a customer transportation needs. Landstar provides services principally throughout the United States and to a lesser extent in Canada, and between the United States and Canada, Mexico and other countries around the world. The Company services emphasize safety, information coordination and customer service and are delivered through a network of independent commission sales agents and third party capacity providers linked together by a series of technological applications which are provided and coordinated by the Company. The nature of the Company business is such that a significant portion of its operating costs varies directly with revenue. Landstar markets its integrated transportation management solutions primarily through independent commission sales agents and exclusively utilizes third party capacity providers to transport customers freight. Landstar independent commission sales agents enter into contractual arrangements with the Company and are responsible for locating freight, making that freight available to Landstar capacity providers and coordinating the transportation of the freight with customers and capacity providers. The Company third party capacity providers consist of independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the Company under exclusive lease arrangements (the BCO Independent Contractors ), unrelated trucking companies who provide truck capacity to the Company under non-exclusive contractual arrangements (the Truck Brokerage Carriers ), air cargo carriers, ocean cargo carriers and railroads. Through this network of agents and capacity providers linked together by Landstar information technology systems, Landstar operates an integrated transportation management solutions business primarily throughout North America with revenue of $3.2 billion during the most recently completed fiscal year. The Company reports the results of two operating segments: the transportation logistics segment and the insurance segment. The transportation logistics segment provides a wide range of integrated transportation management solutions. Transportation services offered by the Company include truckload and less-than-truckload transportation, rail intermodal, air cargo, ocean cargo, expedited ground and air delivery of time-critical freight, heavy-haul/specialized, U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico cross-border, project cargo and customs brokerage. Examples of the industries serviced by the transportation logistics segment include automotive products, building products, metals, chemicals, foodstuffs, heavy machinery, retail, electronics, ammunition and explosives and military equipment. In addition, the transportation logistics segment provides transportation services to other transportation companies, including third party logistics and less-than-truckload service providers. Each of the independent commission sales agents has the opportunity to market all of the services provided by the transportation logistics segment. Billings for freight transportation services are typically charged to customers on a per shipment basis for the physical transportation of freight and are referred to as transportation revenue. During fiscal year 2016, revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors, Truck Brokerage Carriers and railroads represented approximately 47%, 46% and 3%, respectively, of the Company consolidated revenue. Collectively, revenue generated by air and ocean cargo carriers represented approximately 2% of the Company consolidated revenue during fiscal year 2016. The insurance segment is comprised of Signature Insurance Company, a wholly owned offshore insurance subsidiary ( Signature ), and Risk Management Claim Services, Inc. This segment provides risk and claims management services to certain of Landstar Operating Subsidiaries. In addition, it reinsures certain risks of the Company BCO Independent Contractors and provides certain property and casualty insurance directly to certain of Landstar Operating Subsidiaries. Revenue at the insurance segment represents reinsurance premiums from third party insurance companies that provide insurance programs to BCO Independent Contractors where all or a portion of the risk is ultimately borne by Signature. Revenue at the insurance segment represented approximately 1% of the Company consolidated revenue for fiscal year 2016. 20 Table of Contents Changes in Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management believes the Company success principally depends on its ability to generate freight through its network of independent commission sales agents and to safely and efficiently deliver that freight utilizing third party capacity providers. Management believes the most significant factors to the Company success include increasing revenue, sourcing capacity and controlling costs, including insurance and claims. While customer demand, which is subject to overall economic conditions, ultimately drives increases or decreases in revenue, the Company primarily relies on its independent commission sales agents to establish customer relationships and generate revenue opportunities. Management emphasis with respect to revenue growth is on revenue generated by independent commission sales agents who on an annual basis generate $1 million or more of Landstar revenue ( Million Dollar Agents ). Management believes future revenue growth is primarily dependent on its ability to increase both the revenue generated by Million Dollar Agents and the number of Million Dollar Agents through a combination of recruiting new agents and increasing the revenue opportunities generated by existing independent commission sales agents. The following table shows the number of Million Dollar Agents, the average revenue generated by these agents and the percent of consolidated revenue generated by these agents during the past three fiscal years: Fiscal Years 2016 2015 2014 Number of Million Dollar Agents 502 512 525 Average revenue generated per Million Dollar Agent $ 5,831,000 $ 5,998,000 $ 5,609,000 Percent of consolidated revenue generated by Million Dollar Agents 92 % 92 % 92 % The change in the number of Million Dollar Agents on a year-over-year basis is influenced by many factors and is not solely the result of terminations of contractual relationships between agents and the Company, whether such terminations are initiated by the agent or the Company. Such other factors include consolidations among agencies or retirement or similar transition actions. The change in the number of Million Dollar Agents on a year-over-year basis may also be affected by agents that remain with the Company yet experienced lower year-over-year revenue that resulted in such agent moving below the Million Dollar Agent category. In general, the number of agents in the million dollar category who terminate in a given year has been 3% or less of the total number of Million Dollar Agents. The number of Landstar agents who generated between $250,000 and $999,999 of revenue increased by 13, or 4.3%, from 305 during fiscal 2015 to 318 during fiscal 2016. In addition, revenue from accounts formerly handled by terminated Million Dollar Agents is often retained by the Company as the customer may choose to transfer its account to an existing Landstar agent. Management monitors business activity by tracking the number of loads (volume) and revenue per load by mode of transportation. Revenue per load can be influenced by many factors other than a change in price. Those factors include the average length of haul, freight type, special handling and equipment requirements, fuel costs and delivery time requirements. For shipments involving two or more modes of transportation, revenue is generally classified by the mode of transportation having the highest cost for the load. The following table summarizes this information by trailer type for truck transportation and by mode for all others for the past three fiscal years: Fiscal Years 2016 2015 2014 Revenue generated through (in thousands): Truck transportation Truckload: Van equipment $ 1,900,406 $ 1,894,221 $ 1,814,195 Unsided/platform equipment 963,649 1,109,356 1,093,999 Less-than-truckload 74,530 80,687 80,384 Total truck transportation 2,938,585 3,084,264 2,988,578 Rail intermodal 103,721 105,347 81,220 Ocean and air cargo carriers 78,513 86,664 74,952 Other (1) 46,815 44,816 40,040 $ 3,167,634 $ 3,321,091 $ 3,184,790 Revenue on loads hauled via BCO Independent Contractors included in total truck transportation $ 1,488,925 $ 1,522,513 $ 1,514,254 21 Table of Contents Number of loads: Truck transportation Truckload: Van equipment 1,179,183 1,102,654 1,038,517 Unsided/platform equipment 451,686 485,993 444,852 Less-than-truckload 115,521 112,363 96,541 Total truck transportation 1,746,390 1,701,010 1,579,910 Rail intermodal 48,820 45,060 31,640 Ocean and air cargo carriers 20,690 18,060 16,260 1,815,900 1,764,130 1,627,810 Loads hauled via BCO Independent Contractors included in total truck transportation 865,430 826,600 818,480 Revenue per load: Truck transportation Truckload: Van equipment $ 1,612 $ 1,718 $ 1,747 Unsided/platform equipment 2,133 2,283 2,459 Less-than-truckload 645 718 833 Total truck transportation 1,683 1,813 1,892 Rail intermodal 2,125 2,338 2,567 Ocean and air cargo carriers 3,795 4,799 4,610 Revenue per load on loads hauled via BCO Independent Contractors $ 1,720 $ 1,842 $ 1,850 Revenue by capacity type (as a % of total revenue): Truck capacity providers: BCO Independent Contractors 47 % 46 % 48 % Truck Brokerage Carriers 46 % 47 % 46 % Rail intermodal 3 % 3 % 3 % Ocean and air cargo carriers 2 % 3 % 2 % Other 1 % 1 % 1 % (1) Includes primarily reinsurance premium revenue generated by the insurance segment. Also critical to the Company success is its ability to secure capacity, particularly truck capacity, at rates that allow the Company to profitably transport customers freight. The following table summarizes the number of available truck capacity providers as of the end of the three most recent fiscal years: Dec. 31, 2016 Dec. 26, 2015 Dec. 27, 2014 BCO Independent Contractors 8,824 8,907 8,372 Truck Brokerage Carriers: Approved and active(1) 31,471 29,728 26,222 Other approved 15,982 14,715 12,135 47,453 44,443 38,357 Total available truck capacity providers 56,277 53,350 46,729 Trucks provided by BCO Independent Contractors 9,439 9,500 8,932 (1) Active refers to Truck Brokerage Carriers who moved at least one load in the 180 days immediately preceding the fiscal year end. The Company incurs costs that are directly related to the transportation of freight that include purchased transportation and commissions to agents. The Company incurs indirect costs associated with the transportation of freight that include other operating costs and insurance and claims. In addition, the Company incurs selling, general and administrative costs essential to administering its business operations. Management continually monitors all components of the costs incurred by the Company and establishes annual cost budgets which, in general, are used to benchmark costs incurred on a monthly basis. Purchased transportation represents the amount a BCO Independent Contractor or other third party capacity provider is paid to haul freight. The amount of purchased transportation paid to a BCO Independent Contractor is primarily based on a contractually agreed-upon percentage of revenue generated by loads hauled by the BCO Independent Contractor. Purchased transportation paid to a Truck Brokerage Carrier is based on either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or, to a lesser extent, a contractually agreed-upon fixed rate per load. Purchased transportation paid to railroads is based on either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or a 22 Table of Contents contractually agreed-upon fixed rate per load. Purchased transportation paid to air cargo carriers is generally based on a negotiated rate for each load hauled and purchased transportation paid to ocean cargo carriers is generally based on contractually agreed-upon fixed rates. Purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue for truck brokerage, rail intermodal and ocean cargo services is normally higher than that of BCO Independent Contractor and air cargo services. Purchased transportation is the largest component of costs and expenses and, on a consolidated basis, increases or decreases as a percentage of consolidated revenue in proportion to changes in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated through BCO Independent Contractors and other third party capacity providers and external revenue from the insurance segment, consisting of reinsurance premiums. Purchased transportation as a percent of revenue also increases or decreases in relation to the availability of truck brokerage capacity and with changes in the price of fuel on revenue generated by Truck Brokerage Carriers. The Company passes 100% of fuel surcharges billed to customers for freight hauled by BCO Independent Contractors to its BCO Independent Contractors. These fuel surcharges are excluded from revenue and the cost of purchased transportation. Purchased transportation costs are recognized upon the completion of freight delivery. Commissions to agents are based on contractually agreed-upon percentages of revenue or net revenue, defined as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation, or net revenue less a contractually agreed upon percentage of revenue retained by Landstar. Commissions to agents as a percentage of consolidated revenue will vary directly with fluctuations in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated by the various modes of transportation and reinsurance premiums and with changes in net revenue margin, defined as net revenue divided by revenue, on services provided by Truck Brokerage Carriers, railroads, air cargo carriers and ocean cargo carriers. Commissions to agents are recognized upon the completion of freight delivery. The Company defines gross profit as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation and commissions to agents. Gross profit divided by revenue is referred to as gross profit margin. The Company operating margin is defined as operating income divided by gross profit. In general, gross profit margin on revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors represents a fixed percentage of revenue due to the nature of the contracts that pay a fixed percentage of revenue to both the BCO Independent Contractors and independent commission sales agents. For revenue generated by Truck Brokerage Carriers, gross profit margin is either fixed or variable as a percent of revenue, depending on the contract with each individual independent commission sales agent. Under certain contracts with independent commission sales agents, the Company retains a fixed percentage of revenue and the agent retains the amount remaining less the cost of purchased transportation (the retention contracts ). Gross profit margin on revenue generated by railroads, air cargo carriers, ocean cargo carriers and Truck Brokerage Carriers, other than those under retention contracts, is variable in nature as the Company contracts with independent commission sales agents provide commissions to agents at a contractually agreed upon percentage of net revenue for these types of loads. Approximately 55% of the Company consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2016 was generated under contracts that have a fixed gross profit margin while 45% was under contracts that have a variable gross profit margin. Maintenance costs for Company-provided trailing equipment and BCO Independent Contractor recruiting and qualification costs are the largest components of other operating costs. Also included in other operating costs are trailer rental costs, the provision for uncollectible advances and other receivables due from BCO Independent Contractors and independent commission sales agents and gains/losses, if any, on sales of Company-owned trailing equipment. With respect to insurance and claims cost, potential liability associated with accidents in the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable. For commercial trucking claims, Landstar retains liability up to $5,000,000 per occurrence. In addition, for commercial trucking claims incurred on or after May 1, 2016 through April 30, 2017, the Company retains liability up to an additional $700,000 in the aggregate on any claims exceeding its $5,000,000 per occurrence self-insured retention. The Company also retains liability of up to $1,000,000 for each general liability claim, up to $250,000 for each workers compensation claim and up to $250,000 for each cargo claim. The Company exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by Truck Brokerage Carriers, railroads and air and ocean cargo carriers who transport freight on behalf of the Company is reduced by various factors including the extent to which such carriers maintain their own insurance coverage. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, cargo claims or workers compensation claims or the material unfavorable development of existing claims could have a material adverse effect on Landstar cost of insurance and claims and its results of operations. During the 2016 fiscal year, employee compensation and benefits accounted for approximately sixty-five percent of the Company selling, general and administrative costs. Depreciation and amortization primarily relate to depreciation of trailing equipment and information technology hardware and software. 23 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the percentage relationship of purchased transportation and commissions to agents, both being direct costs, to revenue and indirect costs as a percentage of gross profit for the periods indicated: Fiscal Years 2016 2015 2014 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Purchased transportation 76.3 76.8 77.3 Commissions to agents 8.3 8.1 7.9 Gross profit margin 15.4 % 15.0 % 14.8 % Gross profit 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Investment income 0.3 0.3 0.3 Indirect costs and expenses: Other operating costs, net of gains on asset sales/dispositions 6.1 6.3 5.4 Insurance and claims 11.7 9.8 9.8 Selling, general and administrative 29.4 30.0 31.8 Depreciation and amortization 7.3 5.8 5.8 Total costs and expenses 54.5 51.9 52.8 Operating margin 45.8 % 48.4 % 47.4 % Management believes that a discussion of indirect costs as a percentage of gross profit is useful and meaningful to potential investors for the following principal reasons: (1) disclosure of these relative measures (i.e., each indirect operating cost line item as a percentage of gross profit) allows investors to better understand the underlying trends in the Company results of operations; (2) due to the generally fixed nature of these indirect costs (other than insurance and claims costs), these relative measures are meaningful to investors evaluations of the Company management of its indirect costs attributable to operations; (3) management considers this financial information in its decision-making, such as budgeting for infrastructure, trailing equipment and selling, general and administrative costs; and (4) this information facilitates comparisons by investors of the Company results to the results of other non-asset or asset-light companies in the transportation and logistics services industry who report net revenue in Management Discussion and Analysis, which represents revenue less the cost of purchased transportation. The difference between the Company use of the term gross profit and the use of the term net revenue by other companies in the transportation and logistics services industry is due to the direct cost of commissions to agents under the Landstar business model, whereas other companies in this industry generally have no commissions to agents. Also, as previously mentioned, the Company reports two operating segments: the transportation logistics segment and the insurance segment. External revenue at the insurance segment, representing reinsurance premiums, has historically been relatively consistent on a year-over-year basis at 2% or less of consolidated revenue and generally corresponds directly with the number of trucks provided by BCO Independent Contractors. The discussion of indirect cost line items in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations considers the Company costs on a consolidated basis rather than on a segment basis. Management believes this presentation format is the most appropriate to assist users of the financial statements in understanding the Company business for the following reasons: (1) the insurance segment has no other operating costs; (2) discussion of insurance and claims at either segment without reference to the other may create confusion amongst investors and potential investors due to intercompany arrangements and specific deductible programs that affect comparability of financial results by segment between various fiscal periods but that have no effect on the Company from a consolidated reporting perspective; (3) selling, general and administrative costs of the insurance segment comprise less than 10% of consolidated selling, general and administrative costs and have historically been relatively consistent on a year-over-year basis; and (4) the insurance segment has no depreciation and amortization. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 26, 2015 Revenue for fiscal year 2016 was $3,167,634,000, a decrease of $153,457,000, or 5%, compared to fiscal year 2015. Transportation revenue decreased $155,467,000, or 5%. The decrease in transportation revenue was attributable to decreased revenue per load of approximately 7%, while the number of loads hauled in fiscal year 2016 increased approximately 3% compared to fiscal year 2015. Reinsurance premiums were $46,424,000 and $44,414,000 for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in revenue from reinsurance premiums was primarily attributable to the increase in the average number of BCO Independent Contractors in fiscal year 2016. The Company fiscal year ends each year on the last Saturday in December and, as such, the Company fiscal year 2016 included fifty three weeks of operations whereas fiscal year 2015 included fifty two. 24 Table of Contents Truck transportation revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors and Truck Brokerage Carriers (together, the third party truck capacity providers ) for fiscal year 2016, was $2,938,585,000, or 93% of total revenue, a decrease of $145,679,000, or 5%, compared to fiscal year 2015. Revenue per load on loads hauled by third party truck capacity providers decreased approximately 7% in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, while the number of loads hauled increased approximately 3% compared to fiscal year 2015. The decrease in revenue per load on loads hauled via truck was primarily attributable to a somewhat softer freight environment as compared to fiscal year 2015, which resulted in more readily available truck capacity, and the impact of lower diesel fuel costs on loads hauled via Truck Brokerage Carriers. The increase in the number of loads hauled via truck compared to fiscal year 2015 was due to an increase in demand for the Company drop and hook services using the Company van trailers, the effect of the extra operating week during fiscal year 2016, which contributed approximately 20,000 incremental truckloads, and increased market share from new agents. The number of loads hauled via van equipment increased 7%, while the number of loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment decreased 7% in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. Demand for van transportation services utilizing Company provided van trailers, primarily relating to drop and hook services, drove the growth in the number of loads hauled via van trailing equipment during fiscal year 2016. The decrease in the number of loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment was entirely attributable to the impact of approximately 51,000 loads hauled in fiscal year 2015 related to a significant project for a single account in the automotive industry. The project was completed at the end of 2015. Excluding the impact of the loads related to this project hauled during fiscal year 2015, the number of loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment increased 4% during fiscal year 2016. Fuel surcharges billed to customers on revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors are excluded from revenue. Fuel surcharges on Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue identified separately in billings to customers and included as a component of Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue were $56,408,000 and $84,266,000 in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. It should be noted that many customers of truck brokerage services require a single all-in rate that does not separately identify fuel surcharge. Accordingly, the overall impact of changes in fuel prices on revenue and revenue per load on loads hauled via truck is likely greater than that indicated. Transportation revenue generated by rail intermodal, air cargo and ocean cargo carriers (collectively, the multimode capacity providers ) for fiscal year 2016, was $182,234,000, or 6% of total revenue, a decrease of $9,777,000, or 5%, compared to fiscal year 2015. The number of loads hauled by multimode capacity providers in fiscal year 2016 increased approximately 10% compared to fiscal year 2015, while revenue per load on revenue generated by multimode capacity providers decreased approximately 14% over the same period. The increase in loads hauled by multimode capacity providers was primarily due to increased rail intermodal loads, mostly attributable to increased loadings at one specific agency, and a 15% increase in loads hauled by air and ocean cargo carriers. The 15% increase in loads hauled by air and ocean cargo carriers was broad-based across many customers. Revenue per load on loads hauled by multimode capacity providers decreased for all modes, primarily due to softness in the U.S. and global economies. Also, revenue per load on revenue generated by multimode capacity providers is influenced by many factors, including revenue mix among the various modes of transportation used, length of haul, complexity of freight, density of freight lanes, fuel costs and availability of capacity. Purchased transportation was 76.3% and 76.8% of revenue in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a decreased rate of purchased transportation paid to Truck Brokerage Carriers, primarily due to the impact of lower diesel fuel costs and more readily available capacity, and an increase in the percentage of revenue contributed by BCO Independent Contractors, which typically has a lower rate of purchased transportation than revenue generated by Truck Brokerage Carriers. Commissions to agents were 8.3% and 8.1% of revenue in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in commissions to agents as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to an increased net revenue margin on revenue generated by Truck Brokerage Carriers. Investment income was $1,502,000 and $1,396,000 in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other operating costs decreased $1,916,000 in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 and represented 6.1% of gross profit in fiscal year 2016 compared to 6.3% in fiscal year 2015. The decrease in other operating costs compared to the prior year was primarily due to increased gains on sales of used trailing equipment and decreased trailing equipment rental costs, partially offset by an increased provision for contractor bad debt and increased trailing equipment maintenance costs, as the Company increased its number of owned trailers in response to customer demand. The decrease in other operating costs as a percentage of gross profit was caused by the decrease in other operating costs, partially offset by the effect of decreased gross profit. 25 Table of Contents Insurance and claims increased $8,526,000 in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 and represented 11.7% of gross profit in fiscal year 2016 compared to 9.8% in fiscal year 2015. The increase in insurance and claims compared to prior year was due to increased severity of current year claims in fiscal year 2016 and increased insurance premiums on the Company commercial trucking liability coverage, partially offset by decreased net unfavorable development of prior years claims in fiscal year 2016 as unfavorable development of prior years claims was $1,079,000 and $4,852,000 in fiscal year 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in insurance and claims as a percentage of gross profit was caused by the increase in insurance and claims costs and the effect of decreased gross profit. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased $6,465,000 in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 and represented 29.4% of gross profit in fiscal year 2016 compared to 30.0% of gross profit in fiscal year 2015. The decrease in selling, general and administrative costs compared to prior year was attributable to a decreased provision for bonuses under the Company incentive compensation plan, decreased stock-based compensation expense and a decreased provision for customer bad debt in fiscal year 2016, partially offset by increased costs during fiscal year 2016 associated with the Company multi-year project designed to enhance the Company information systems. The decrease in selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of gross profit was due primarily to the decrease in selling, general and administrative costs, partially offset by the effect of decreased gross profit. Depreciation and amortization increased $6,694,000 in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 and represented 7.3% of gross profit in fiscal year 2016 compared to 5.8% of gross profit in fiscal year 2015. The increase in depreciation and amortization costs was due to depreciation on new trailing equipment as the Company increased its number of owned trailers in response to increased customer demand for the Company drop and hook services using Company-owned van trailers and a lower average age of the fleet during the 2016 period. The increase in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of gross profit was primarily due to the increased depreciation costs and the effect of decreased gross profit. Interest and debt expense in fiscal year 2016 was $845,000 higher than fiscal year 2015. The increase in interest and debt expense was primarily due to increased interest related to capital lease obligations as the Company increased its number of owned trailers in response to customer demand. The provisions for income taxes for both fiscal years 2016 and 2015 were based on estimated annual effective income tax rates of 38.2% adjusted for discrete events, such as benefits resulting from disqualifying dispositions of the Company Common Stock by employees who obtained the stock through exercises of incentive stock options. The effective income tax rate for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 were 37.4% and 38.1%, respectively, which was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily as a result of state taxes, the meals and entertainment exclusion and non-deductible stock-based compensation. The decrease in the effective income tax rate compared to prior year is primarily attributable to benefits related to certain tax matters recognized in the 2016 period. Net income was $137,350,000, or $3.26 per common share ($3.25 per diluted share), in fiscal year 2016. Net income was $147,689,000, or $3.38 per common share ($3.37 per diluted share), in fiscal year 2015. Fiscal Year Ended December 26, 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 27, 2014 Revenue for fiscal year 2015 was $3,321,091,000, an increase of $136,301,000, or 4%, compared to fiscal year 2014. Transportation revenue increased $131,264,000, or 4%. The increase in transportation revenue was primarily attributable to an approximately 8% increase in the number of loads hauled, partially offset by decreased revenue per load of approximately 4%. Reinsurance premiums from third party insurance companies that provide insurance programs to BCO Independent Contractors where all or a portion of the risk of loss is ultimately borne by Signature, were $44,414,000 and $39,377,000 for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in revenue from reinsurance premiums was primarily attributable to the net increase in the number of BCO Independent Contractors in fiscal year 2015. Truck transportation revenue hauled by third party truck capacity providers for fiscal year 2015, was $3,084,264,000, or 93% of total revenue, an increase of $95,686,000, or 3%, compared to fiscal year 2014. The number of loads hauled by third party truck capacity providers in fiscal year 2015 increased approximately 8% compared to fiscal year 2014, while revenue per load decreased approximately 4% compared to fiscal year 2014. The increase in the number of loads hauled via truck compared to fiscal year 2014 was due to an increase in demand for the Company drop and hook services using the Company van trailers, an increase in loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment, driven by demand from one shipper for a specific project in the automotive sector and increased market share from new agents. The decrease in revenue per load on loads hauled via truck was primarily attributable to the impact of lower diesel fuel costs on loads hauled via Truck Brokerage Carriers and a decrease in the number of loads hauled via heavy specialized equipment as a percentage of total truck loads, which typically have a higher revenue per load. The number of loads 26 Table of Contents hauled via van equipment increased 6% while revenue per load on loads hauled via van equipment decreased 2% compared to fiscal year 2014. Demand for Landstar van transportation services was broad-based across many customers and geographic regions, with particular strength for drop and hook services. The decrease in van revenue per load was primarily due to the impact of lower diesel fuel costs on loads hauled via Truck Brokerage Carriers. The number of loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment increased 9% while revenue per load on loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment decreased 7% compared to fiscal year 2014. The increase in the number of loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment was driven by one shipper for a specific project in the automotive sector during fiscal year 2015. The decrease in unsided/platform revenue per load of 7% was due to a decreased average length of haul in fiscal year 2015, primarily driven by increased loadings from a project for an existing automotive customer, which had a comparatively lower average length of haul, a decrease in the percentage of unsided/platform revenue contributed by heavy specialized equipment, which tends to have a higher revenue per load and the impact of lower diesel fuel costs on loads hauled via Truck Brokerage Carriers. The increase in the number of LTL loads of 16% compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to increased loadings at one specific customer and increased market share as more of the Company independent commission agents participate in this service offering. The decrease in LTL revenue per load of 14% compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to increased loadings at one specific customer, which had a comparatively low revenue per load. Fuel surcharges on Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue identified separately in billings to customers and included as a component of Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue were $84,266,000 and $121,656,000 in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. Not all customers require separately identified fuel surcharges and, therefore, the fuel surcharges separately identified do not necessarily represent the overall impact of changes in fuel prices on Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue and revenue per load. Fuel surcharges billed to customers on revenue hauled by BCO Independent Contractors are excluded from revenue. Transportation revenue hauled by multimode capacity providers for fiscal year 2015, was $192,011,000, or 6% of total revenue, an increase of $35,839,000, or 23%, compared to fiscal year 2014. The number of loads hauled by multimode capacity providers in fiscal year 2015 increased approximately 32% compared to fiscal year 2014, while revenue per load on revenue hauled by multimode capacity providers decreased approximately 7% over the same period. The increase in loads hauled by multimode capacity providers was primarily due to increased rail intermodal loads. The decrease in revenue per load on revenue hauled by multimode capacity providers was primarily due to decreased revenue per load on rail intermodal loads and an increase in rail intermodal loads as a percentage of multimode loads, as rail intermodal loads generally generate a lower revenue per load compared to loads hauled by ocean or air carriers. Also, revenue per load on revenue hauled by multimode capacity providers is influenced by many factors, including revenue mix among the various modes of transportation used, length of haul, complexity of freight, density of freight lanes, fuel costs and availability of capacity. Purchased transportation was 76.8% and 77.3% of revenue in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a decreased rate of purchased transportation paid to Truck Brokerage Carriers, primarily due to the impact of lower diesel fuel costs. Commissions to agents were 8.1% and 7.9% of revenue in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in commissions to agents as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to an increased net revenue margin on revenue hauled by Truck Brokerage Carriers. Investment income was $1,396,000 and $1,381,000 in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. Other operating costs increased $5,847,000 in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 and represented 6.3% of gross profit in fiscal year 2015 compared to 5.4% in fiscal year 2014. The increase in other operating costs compared to the prior year was primarily due to increased trailing equipment maintenance and rental costs, as the Company increased its number of owned trailers in response to customer demand and retained older van trailing equipment that tends to have higher maintenance costs than new trailing equipment, and decreased gains on sales of used trailing equipment. The increase in other operating costs as a percentage of gross profit was primarily caused by the increase in trailing equipment and rental costs and decreased gains on sale of used trailing equipment, partially offset by the effect of increased gross profit in fiscal year 2015. Insurance and claims increased $2,474,000 in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 and represented 9.8% of gross profit in both fiscal years 2015 and 2014. The increase in insurance and claims compared to prior year was due to increased frequency in the number of insurance claims in fiscal year 2015, partially offset by decreased net unfavorable development of prior years claims estimates from $6,664,000 in fiscal year 2014 to $4,852,000 in fiscal year 2015. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased $546,000 in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 and represented 30.0% of gross profit in fiscal year 2015 compared to 31.8% of gross profit in fiscal year 2014. The decrease in selling, general and administrative costs compared to prior year was due to a $17,793,000 provision for incentive compensation in fiscal year 2014 compared to a $6,638,000 provision in fiscal year 2015, partially offset by increased employee wages and benefits and an increased provision for customer bad debt, primarily related to one customer. The decrease in selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of gross profit was also due to the effect of increased gross profit in fiscal year 2015. 27 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization increased $1,527,000 in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 and represented 5.8% of gross profit in both fiscal years 2015 and 2014. The increase in depreciation and amortization costs were primarily due to depreciation on new trailing equipment that replaced older, fully depreciated trailing equipment. Interest and debt expense in fiscal year 2015 was $228,000 lower than fiscal year 2014. The decrease in interest and debt expense was primarily due to lower average borrowing rates on capital lease obligations. The provisions for income taxes for both fiscal years 2015 and 2014 were based on estimated annual effective income tax rates of approximately 38.2% adjusted for discrete events, such as benefits resulting from disqualifying dispositions of the Company Common Stock by employees who obtained the stock through exercises of incentive stock options. The effective income tax rates for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 were 38.1% and 37.2%, respectively, which was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily as a result of state taxes, the meals and entertainment exclusion and non-deductible stock-based compensation. The increase in the effective income tax rate compared to prior year is primarily attributable to benefits related to certain tax matters recognized in the 2014 period. Net income was $147,689,000, or $3.38 per common share ($3.37 per diluted share), in fiscal year 2015. Net income was $138,809,000, or $3.09 per common share ($3.07 per diluted share), in fiscal year 2014. Capital Resources and Liquidity Working capital and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities were $357,096,000 and 1.9 to 1, respectively, at December 31, 2016, compared with $286,581,000 and 1.8 to 1, respectively, at December 26, 2015, and $315,281,000 and 1.8 to 1, respectively, at December 27, 2014. Landstar has historically operated with current ratios within the range of 1.5 to 1 to 2.0 to 1. Cash provided by operating activities was $190,242,000, $216,022,000, and $101,869,000 in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2016 was primarily attributable to the reduction in net income and the timing of collections of trade receivables. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily attributable to the timing of collections of trade receivables. The Company declared and paid $0.34 per share, or $14,332,000 in the aggregate, in cash dividends during fiscal year 2016. The Company declared and paid $0.30 per share, or $13,088,000 in the aggregate, in cash dividends during fiscal year 2015 and, during such period, also paid $44,794,000 of dividends payable which were declared during fiscal year 2014 and included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 27, 2014. The Company declared and paid $0.26 per share, or $11,685,000 in the aggregate, in cash dividends during fiscal year 2014 and, during such period, also paid $15,921,000 of dividends payable which were declared during fiscal year 2013 and included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 28, 2013. During fiscal year 2016, the Company purchased 773,281 shares of its Common Stock at a total cost of $50,516,000. During fiscal year 2015 and 2014, the Company purchased 2,497,748 and 939,872 shares of its Common Stock at a total cost of $161,152,000 and $56,393,000, respectively. The Company has used cash provided by operating activities to fund the purchases. Since January 1997, the Company has purchased approximately $1,379,000,000 of its Common Stock under programs authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company in open market and private block transactions. As of December 31, 2016, the Company may purchase up to an additional 1,036,125 shares of its Common Stock under its authorized stock purchase program. Long-term debt, including current maturities, was $138,304,000 at December 31, 2016, compared to $124,292,000 at December 26, 2015 and $111,321,000 at December 27, 2014. Shareholders equity was $542,557,000, or 80% of total capitalization (defined as long-term debt including current maturities plus equity), at December 31, 2016, compared to $466,237,000, or 79% of total capitalization, at December 26, 2015 and $488,261,000, or 81% of total capitalization, at December 27, 2014. The increase in equity in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily a result of net income, partially offset by the purchase of shares of the Company Common Stock and dividends declared by the Company in fiscal year 2016. The decrease in equity in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily a result of the purchases of shares of the Company Common Stock and dividends declared by the Company in fiscal year 2015, partially offset by net income. On June 2, 2016, Landstar entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement, which matures on June 2, 2021, provides $250,000,000 of borrowing capacity in the form of a revolving credit facility, $50,000,000 of which may be utilized in the form of letter of credit guarantees. The credit agreement includes an accordion feature providing for a possible increase up to an aggregate borrowing amount of $400,000,000. The Company prior credit agreement was terminated on June 2, 2016. 28 Table of Contents The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that limit, among other things, the incurrence of additional indebtedness. The Company is required to, among other things, maintain a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, and maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, below a specified maximum. The Credit Agreement provides for a restriction on cash dividends and other distributions to stockholders on the Company capital stock to the extent there is a default under the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement under certain circumstances limits the amount of such cash dividends and other distributions to stockholders to the extent that, after giving effect to any payment made to effect such cash dividend or other distribution, the Leverage Ratio would exceed 2.5 to 1 on a pro forma basis as of the end of the Company most recently completed fiscal quarter. The Credit Agreement provides for an event of default in the event that, among other things, a person or group acquires 35% or more of the outstanding capital stock of the Company or obtains power to elect a majority of the Company directors or directors cease to consist of a majority of Continuing Directors, as defined in the Credit Agreement. None of these covenants are presently considered by management to be materially restrictive to the Company operations, capital resources or liquidity. The Company is currently in compliance with all of the debt covenants under the Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2016, the Company had no borrowings outstanding and $35,599,000 of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2016, there was $214,401,000 available for future borrowings under the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Company has $61,110,000 in letters of credit outstanding as collateral for insurance claims that are secured by investments totaling $67,900,000 at December 31, 2016. Investments, all of which are carried at fair value, include primarily investment-grade bonds and U.S. Treasury obligations having maturities of up to five years. Fair value of investments is based primarily on quoted market prices. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further discussion on measurement of fair value of investments. Historically, the Company has generated sufficient operating cash flow to meet its debt service requirements, fund continued growth, both organic and through acquisitions, complete or execute share purchases of its Common Stock under authorized share purchase programs, pay dividends and meet working capital needs. As an asset-light provider of integrated transportation management solutions, the Company annual capital requirements for operating property are generally for trailing equipment and information technology hardware and software. In addition, a significant portion of the trailing equipment used by the Company is provided by third party capacity providers, thereby reducing the Company capital requirements. During fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, Landstar acquired $61,504,000, $49,491,000 and $47,232,000, respectively, of trailing equipment by entering into capital leases. During fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company also purchased $22,645,000, $4,804,000 and $10,539,000, respectively, of operating property. Included in the $22,645,000 of purchases of operating property during fiscal year 2016 is $17,237,000 related to a new freight staging and transload facility in Laredo, Texas. Landstar also acquired $5,298,000 of operating property relating to the development of the Laredo property for which the Company accrued a corresponding liability in accounts payable as of December 31, 2016. Landstar anticipates acquiring either by purchase or lease financing approximately $43,000,000 in operating property in fiscal year 2017, consisting primarily of new trailing equipment to replace older trailing equipment and information technology equipment. Management believes that cash flow from operations combined with the Company borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement will be adequate to meet Landstar debt service requirements, fund continued growth, both internal and through acquisitions, pay dividends, complete the authorized share purchase program and meet working capital needs. Contractual Obligations and Commitments At December 31, 2016, the Company obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as debt and lease agreements, were as follows (in thousands): Contractual Obligation Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Capital lease obligations $ 144,571 $ 47,860 $ 67,085 $ 29,626 $ Operating lease obligations 1,551 634 547 106 264 Purchase obligations 18,053 16,012 1,773 268 $ 164,175 $ 64,506 $ 69,405 $ 30,000 $ 264 Capital lease obligations above include $6,267,000 of imputed interest. Purchase obligations at December 31, 2016 are primarily commitments for trailing equipment additions during fiscal 2017. At December 31, 2016, the Company has gross unrecognized tax benefits of $2,635,000. This amount is excluded from the table above as the Company cannot reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. At December 31, 2016, the Company has insurance claims liabilities of $53,004,000. 29 Table of Contents This amount is excluded from the table above as the Company cannot reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement on these liabilities. The short-term portion of the insurance claims liability is reported on the consolidated balance sheets primarily on an actuarially determined basis. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2016, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements, other than operating leases as disclosed in the table of Contractual Obligations and Commitments above, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the Company financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Legal Matters The Company is involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business. Many of these claims are covered in whole or in part by insurance. Based on knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable losses with respect to the resolution of all such claims and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome, after provisions therefor, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company, but could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given quarter or year. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The allowance for doubtful accounts for both trade and other receivables represents management estimate of the amount of outstanding receivables that will not be collected. Historically, management estimates for uncollectible receivables have been materially correct. Although management believes the amount of the allowance for both trade and other receivables at December 31, 2016 is appropriate, a prolonged period of low or no economic growth may adversely affect the collection of these receivables. In addition, liquidity concerns and/or unanticipated bankruptcy proceedings at any of the Company larger customers in which the Company is carrying a significant receivable could result in an increase in the provision for uncollectible receivables and have a significant impact on the Company results of operations in a given quarter or year. However, it is not expected that an uncollectible accounts receivable resulting from an individual customer would have a significant impact on the Company financial condition. Conversely, a more robust economic environment or the recovery of a previously provided for uncollectible receivable from an individual customer may result in the realization of some portion of the estimated uncollectible receivables. Landstar provides for the estimated costs of self-insured claims primarily on an actuarial basis. The amount recorded for the estimated liability for claims incurred is based upon the facts and circumstances known on the applicable balance sheet date. The ultimate resolution of these claims may be for an amount greater or less than the amount estimated by management. The Company continually revises its existing claim estimates as new or revised information becomes available on the status of each claim. Historically, the Company has experienced both favorable and unfavorable development of prior years claims estimates. During fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, insurance and claims costs included $1,079,000, $4,852,000 and $6,664,000 of net unfavorable adjustments to prior years claims estimates, respectively. The unfavorable development of prior years claims in the 2015 fiscal year primarily related to a single claim for which the Company incurred a pre-tax charge of $4,500,000. The majority of the unfavorable development of prior years claims in the 2014 fiscal year related to three claims. It is reasonably likely that the ultimate outcome of settling all outstanding claims will be more or less than the estimated claims reserve at December 31, 2016. The Company utilizes certain income tax planning strategies to reduce its overall cost of income taxes. If the Company were to be subject to an audit, it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed resulting in an increased liability for income taxes. Certain of these tax planning strategies result in a level of uncertainty as to whether the related tax positions taken by the Company would result in a recognizable benefit. The Company has provided for its estimated exposure attributable to such tax positions due to the corresponding level of uncertainty with respect to the amount of income tax benefit that may ultimately be realized. Management believes that the provision for liabilities resulting from the uncertainty in certain income tax positions is appropriate. To date, the Company has not experienced an examination by governmental revenue authorities that would lead management to believe that the Company past provisions for exposures related to the uncertainty of such income tax positions are not appropriate. Significant variances from management estimates for the amount of uncollectible receivables, the ultimate resolution of self-insured claims and the provision for uncertainty in income tax positions could each be expected to positively or negatively affect Landstar earnings in a given quarter or year. However, management believes that the ultimate resolution of these items, given a range of reasonably likely outcomes, will not significantly affect the long-term financial condition of Landstar or its ability to fund its continuing operations. 30 Table of Contents Effects of Inflation Management does not believe inflation has had a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition of Landstar in the past five years. However, inflation in excess of historical trends might have an adverse effect on the Company results of operations in the future. Seasonality Landstar operations are subject to seasonal trends common to the trucking industry. Results of operations for the quarter ending in March are typically lower than for the quarters ending June, September and December.
