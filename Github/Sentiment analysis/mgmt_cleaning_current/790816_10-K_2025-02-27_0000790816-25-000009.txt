Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere herein and is based primarily on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. This report including the following discussion, contains forward-looking statements, which we intend to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, will, should and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the 31 expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be achieved. These forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and actual results may differ from expectations. See Forward-Looking Statements immediately before Part I of this report. OVERVIEW During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, we owned and managed properties within four segments: (1) Philadelphia Central Business District ( Philadelphia CBD ), (2) Pennsylvania Suburbs, (3) Austin, Texas, and (4) Other. The Philadelphia CBD segment includes properties located in the City of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Suburbs segment includes properties in Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties in the Philadelphia suburbs. The Austin, Texas segment includes properties in the City of Austin, Texas. The Other segment includes properties in Northern Virginia, Washington, D.C., Southern Maryland, Camden County, New Jersey and New Castle County, Delaware. In addition to the four segments, our corporate group is responsible for cash and investment management, development/redevelopment of certain properties during the construction period, and certain other general support functions. Our financial condition and operating performance are dependent upon the demand for office, residential, life science, parking and retail space in our markets, our leasing results, our acquisition, disposition and development/redevelopment activity, our financing activity, our cash requirements and economic and market conditions, including prevailing interest rates. We generate cash and revenue from leases of space at our Properties and, to a lesser extent, from the management and development/redevelopment of properties owned by third parties (primarily unconsolidated real estate ventures) and from investments in the unconsolidated real estate ventures. Factors that we evaluate when leasing space include rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, tenant creditworthiness, current and expected operating costs, the length of the lease term, vacancy levels and demand for space. We also generate cash through sales of assets, including assets that we do not view as core to our business plan, either because of location or expected growth potential, and assets that are commanding premium prices from third party investors. Overall macroeconomic conditions, including but not limited to inflation and high interest rates and changes in work patterns, including remote working arrangements, that have contributed to negative lease absorption within our office markets, have had a dampening effect on the fundamentals of our business, as reflected in, among other metrics, our increased borrowing costs and lower occupancy as well as downward pressures on asset valuations. These adverse conditions could continue to impact our net income, cash flows and liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Notwithstanding the challenging macroeconomic conditions, which have contributed to recent difficulties in asset dispositions at acceptable prices, leasing of vacant space at attractive rents and sourcing of capital for development projects at acceptable costs, as well as to impairments of assets, we believe that our portfolio of Properties and investments, and liquidity profile, will allow us to maintain stable operating performance. In our ongoing assessment of our Properties as quality or high quality , we consider both their quantitative and qualitative attributes, including in relation to other properties within a given submarket or adjacent submarkets that compete with our portfolio for tenants. The attributes that we consider in our assessment include the age and condition of the property, average asking rental rates, access to mass transit and highways, floorplate efficiencies, amenities within, and nearby, the property and availability of parking as well as market demographics such that bear on demand for space at our portfolio. We also believe that our portfolio and liquidity profile will enable us to raise capital, as necessary, in various forms and from different sources, including through secured or unsecured loans from banks, pension funds and life insurance companies. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow funds on terms that are economically attractive or at all. We continue to seek revenue growth throughout our portfolio by increasing occupancy and rental rates. Occupancy at our Core Properties at December 31, 2024 was 87.8% compared to 88.0% at December 31, 2023. 32 The table below summarizes selected operating and leasing statistics of our wholly owned properties for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023: Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Leasing Activity Core Properties (1)(2): Total net rentable square feet owned 11,930,549 12,698,115 11,930,549 12,698,115 Occupancy percentage (end of period) 87.8 % 88.0 % 87.8 % 88.0 % Average occupancy percentage 87.4 % 88.0 % 88.3 % 88.9 % Total Portfolio, less properties in development/redevelopment: Tenant retention rate (3) 75.6 % 44.7 % 63.0 % 49.3 % New leases and expansions commenced (square feet) 97,657 123,515 425,604 342,731 Leases renewed (square feet) 100,776 85,620 597,808 423,998 Net absorption (square feet) 32,455 (62,512) (128,494) (298,896) Percentage change in rental rates per square foot (4): New and expansion rental rates 8.0 % 24.6 % 17.8 % 22.2 % Renewal rental rates 5.4 % 5.9 % 11.3 % 10.9 % Combined rental rates 5.9 % 13.4 % 12.6 % 13.5 % Weighted average lease term for leases commenced (years) 6.4 4.9 6.2 6.2 Average annual rent (per square foot) (6) (7) $ 40.07 $ 36.54 $ 40.08 $ 37.25 Capital Costs Committed (5)(6): Leasing commissions (per square foot) $ 5.56 $ 5.63 $ 7.77 $ 7.65 Tenant improvements (per square foot) $ 12.32 $ 11.30 $ 21.19 $ 14.11 Total capital per square foot per lease year $ 3.07 $ 3.10 $ 3.88 $ 3.23 Average annualized capital as % of average annual rent (6) (7) 8.9 % 10.8 % 12.0 % 10.0 % (1) Does not include properties under development, redevelopment, held for sale, or sold. (2) Includes leasing at recently completed not-stabilized Properties. The statistics presented for periods ended prior to the three-month period ended December 31, 2024 have not been adjusted for properties sold subsequent to the periods presented. (3) Calculated as percentage of total square feet. (4) Includes base rent plus reimbursement for operating expenses and real estate taxes. (5) Calculated on a weighted average basis. (6) For comparison purposes, we exclude new leases of space when the previous lease of such space ended more than 12 months from the signing date for the new leases. (7) Average annual rent represents total initial contractual rent under the applicable leases plus contractual fixed rent increases due under the applicable leases averaged over the total terms of the applicable leases. Our actual leasing capital costs as a percentage of rents are largely a function of the composition of our leases to new tenants or renewals with existing tenants, in addition to size and timing of occupancy. We generally experience lower leasing costs in connection with the renewal of leases with existing tenants compared to leases with new tenants. Our properties compete for tenants with similar properties primarily on the basis of location, total occupancy costs (including base rent and operating expenses), services and amenities, and the design and condition of the properties. As leases at our properties expire, we face competition to renew or re-let space in light of the competing properties within the applicable markets. As a result, and as part of customary lease negotiations, we are often required to provide rent concessions or abatements, incur charges for tenant improvements and other inducements, including early termination rights or potential below market renewal options, all of which impact, in varying degrees, annualized rents. 33 The table below summarizes occupancy statistics of our Core Properties by segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023: Twelve months ended December 31, % Occupied % Occupied 2024 2023 Philadelphia CBD 93.7 % 95.2 % Pennsylvania Suburbs 88.2 % 86.5 % Austin, Texas 77.8 % 81.7 % Other 83.2 % 80.5 % Total - Core Properties 87.8 % 88.0 % The table below summarizes the occupancy statistics of our Properties, broken down by property types for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023: Twelve months ended December 31, Twelve months ended December 31, % Net Operating Income (4) % Net Operating Income (4) % Occupied % Occupied 2024 2023 2024 2023 Office 90.8 % 91.1 % 89.5 % 89.2 % Life Science (1) 6.1 % 6.1 % 81.7 % 84.6 % Residential (2) 3.1 % 2.8 % 82.2 % 83.7 % Total (3) 100.0 % 100.0 % 88.9 % 89.1 % (1) Represents Philadelphia portfolio assets located at 3000 Market Street and 3025 Market Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, dedicated life science floors at Cira Centre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and 250 King of Prussia Road in Radnor, Pennsylvania. (2) Represents our residential operation at 2929 Walnut Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (3) Does not include Properties under development/redevelopment. (4) See Note 18 Segment Information, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the definition of Net Operating Income. In seeking to increase revenue through our operating, financing, and investment activities, we also seek to minimize operating risks, including (i) tenant rollover risk, (ii) tenant credit risk and (iii) development risk. We have compared our weighted-average in-place rental rates to our leases signed in 2024 and our current market leasing assumptions, and while the actual results will be dependent on the leases expiring in any particular period, we believe the current portfolio should generate positive rental rate increases for the remainder of fiscal 2024. Tenant Rollover Risk We are subject to the risk that tenant leases, upon expiration, will not be renewed, that space may not be relet, or that the terms of renewal or reletting (including the cost of renovations) may be less favorable to us than the current lease terms. Leases that accounted for approximately 3.9% of our aggregate final annualized base rents as of December 31, 2024 (representing approximately 4.2% of the net rentable square feet of the properties) are scheduled to expire without penalty in 2025. We maintain an active dialogue with our tenants in an effort to maximize lease renewals. If we are unable to renew leases or relet space under expiring leases, at anticipated rental rates, or if tenants terminate their leases early, our cash flow would be adversely impacted. Tenant Credit Risk In the event of a tenant default, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment. Our management evaluates our accrued rent receivable reserve policy in light of our tenant base and general and local economic conditions. Our accrued rent receivable allowance was $0.9 million or 0.5% of our accrued rent receivable balance as of December 31, 2024 compared to $2.7 million or 1.4% of our accrued rent receivable balance as of December 31, 2023. 34 If economic conditions deteriorate, including as a result of inflation and high interest rates we may experience increases in past due accounts, defaults, lower occupancy and reduced effective rents. This condition would negatively affect our future net income and cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Development and Redevelopment Risk Development and Redevelopment projects are subject to a variety of risks, including construction delays, construction cost overruns, building moratoriums, inability to obtain financing on favorable terms, inability to lease space at projected rates, inability to enter into construction, development and other agreements on favorable terms, and unexpected environmental and other hazards. As of December 31, 2024, the following recently completed development project was not yet stabilized (dollars, in thousands): Property/Portfolio Name Location Completion Date Activity Type Approximate Square Footage Estimated Costs Amount Funded 250 King of Prussia Road Radnor, PA Q3 2022 Redevelopment 168,294 $ 102,563 (a) $ 90,734 (a) Total project costs include $20.6 million of existing property basis.

(b) Debt financing amount represents an estimate at 55% Loan-to-Value ratio for 3151 Market Street. (c) Estimated costs include base building costs plus projected tenant fit out costs for remaining vacancies. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. Certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies, as they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Impairment We assess each of our real estate investments for indicators of impairment quarterly or when circumstances indicate that a real estate investment may be impaired. When indicators of potential impairment are present that suggest that the carrying amounts of real estate investments and related intangible assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability by determining whether the respective carrying values will be recovered through the estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition over, in most cases, a ten-year holding period. If we believe there is a significant possibility that we might dispose of the assets earlier, we assess the recoverability using a probability weighted analysis of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the operations and eventual disposition of the assets over the various possible holding periods. If the recoverability assessment indicates that 35 the carrying value of a tested real estate investment is not recoverable from estimated undiscounted future cash flows, it is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment is recognized. If and when our plans change, we revise our recoverability analyses to use the cash flows expected from the operations and eventual disposition of each asset using holding periods that are consistent with our revised plans. Real estate investment fair values are estimated based on agreements with third parties, discounted cash flows, or comparable sales. Estimated future cash flows used in such analyses are based on our views of market and economic conditions. The estimation of future cash flows is subjective and is based on various assumptions, including but not limited to market rental rates, capitalization rates, and recent sales data for comparable real estate investments. Estimated future cash flows are discounted when determining fair value of an asset. Most of these assumptions are influenced by our direct experience with the real estate investments and their markets as well as market data obtained from real estate leasing and brokerage firms. Determining the appropriate capitalization or discount rate also requires significant judgment and is typically based on many factors, including the prevailing rate for the market or submarket, as well as the quality and location of the real estate investment. Changes in the estimated future cash flows due to changes in our plans for a real estate investment, views of market and economic conditions and/or our ability to obtain development rights could result in recognition of an impairment which could be material. Real estate investments held for sale are carried at the lower of their carrying values (i.e., cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment recognized, where applicable) or estimated fair values less costs to sell. Accordingly, decisions to sell certain operating real estate investments, real estate investments in development or land held for development will result in impairments if carrying values of the specific real estate investments exceed their estimated fair values less costs to sell. The estimates of fair value consider matters such as recent sales data for comparable real estate investments and, where applicable, contracts or the results of negotiations with prospective purchasers. These estimates are subject to revision as market conditions, and our assessment of such conditions, change. In addition to our real estate investments, we review each of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures to determine whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance, changes in anticipated hold periods, and general market conditions, that the Company's investment in the unconsolidated joint venture may be impaired. If any indicators of impairment are present, we calculate the fair value of the investment in the unconsolidated real estate venture. If the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value, we determine whether the impairment is other than temporary. If the impairment is determined to be other than temporary, we record an impairment. We use considerable judgment in the determination of whether indicators of impairment are present and, in the assumptions, estimations, and inputs used in calculating the fair value of the investment, which is generally determined through income valuation approaches, including discounted cash flows and direct capitalization models. These judgments are similar to those outlined above in the impairment of real estate investments. We also use judgment in making the determination as to whether or not the impairment is temporary by considering, among other things, the length of time that the market value has been less than cost, the financial condition of the unconsolidated real estate venture and our ability and intent to retain the investment long enough for a recovery in value. Our judgments related to the determination of fair value and whether an impairment is other than temporary could result in the recognition of an impairment which could be material. Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenues are derived from leases and are reflected as rents on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Most of our leases involve some form of improvements to leased space. When we are required to provide improvements under the terms of a lease, we need to determine whether the improvements constitute landlord assets or tenant assets. If the improvements are landlord assets, we capitalize the cost of the improvements and recognize depreciation expense associated with such improvements over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the lease. If the improvements are tenant assets, we defer the cost of improvements funded by us as a lease incentive asset and amortize it as a reduction of rental revenue over the term of the lease. Our determination of whether improvements are landlord assets or tenant assets also may affect when we commence revenue recognition in connection with a lease. In determining whether improvements constitute landlord or tenant assets, we consider a number of factors that may require subjective or complex judgments, including: whether the improvements are unique to the tenant or reusable by other tenants; whether the tenant is permitted to alter or remove the improvements without our consent or without compensating us for any 36 lost fair value; whether the ownership of the improvements remains with us or remains with the tenant at the end of the lease term; and whether the economic substance of the lease terms is properly reflected. For certain leases, we make significant assumptions and judgments in determining the lease term, including assumptions when the lease provides the tenant with an early termination option. The lease term impacts the period over which we determine and record rental revenue and impacts the period over which we amortize lease-related costs. Changes in these assessments could result in the write-off of any recorded assets associated with straight-line rental revenue and acceleration of depreciation and amortization expense associated with costs we incurred related to these leases. Purchase Price Allocation When we acquire real estate investments, we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets, consisting of land, building, site improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, including in-place leases and acquired above- and below-market leases, and if applicable, assumed debt, based on our estimate of their fair values. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and capitalization rates as well as available market information. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired real estate investment considers the value of the real estate investment as if it were vacant. The estimated relative fair value of acquired in-place leases are the estimated costs to lease the real estate investment to the occupancy level at the date of acquisition. We evaluate the period over which we expect stabilized occupancy level to be achieved during the lease-up period. Above- and below-market leases are recorded as an asset or liability based upon the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid or received pursuant to the in-place leases, and our estimate of fair market rental rates for the corresponding in-place leases, over the remaining noncancellable term. Assumed debt, if any, is recorded at fair value based upon the present value of the expected future payments. A change in any of the key assumptions can materially change not only the presentation of acquired real estate investments in our consolidated financial statements but also our reported results of operations. Common Development Cost Estimates for Contributions to Development Joint Ventures When land is contributed to a development joint venture, estimated common development costs include actual costs incurred and estimates of future common development costs benefiting the property sold. When land is sold, common development costs, if they cannot be specifically identified, are allocated to each sold parcel based upon its relative sales value. For purposes of allocating common development costs, estimates of future sales proceeds and common development costs are re-evaluated throughout the year, with adjustments being allocated prospectively to the remaining land parcels available for sale. The common development cost estimates for development joint ventures are highly judgmental as they are sensitive to cost escalation, sales price escalation and pace of absorption, which are subject to judgment and are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. Changes in the assumptions used to estimate future common development costs could result in a significant impact on the amounts recorded as net gain on disposition of real estate or net gain on sale of undepreciated real estate. 37 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Part II, Item 7. Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 which is presented therein in the form of a year-to-year comparison to the year ended December 31, 2023. We believe that presentation of our consolidated financial information, without a breakdown by segment, will effectively present important information useful to our investors. Net operating income ( NOI ), as presented in the comparative analysis, below is defined as total revenue less property operating expenses, real estate taxes, and third party management expenses. Property operating expenses that are included in determining NOI consist of costs that are necessary and allocable to our operating properties such as utilities, property-level salaries, repairs and maintenance, property insurance, management fees, and bad debt expense. General and administrative expenses that are not reflected in NOI primarily consist of corporate-level salaries, amortization of share awards, and professional fees that are incurred as part of corporate office management. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use internally to evaluate the operating performance of our real estate assets by segment, as presented in Note 18 Segment Information, to our Consolidated Financial Statements, and of our business as a whole. We believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. While NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. NOI does not reflect interest expenses, real estate impairments, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures, and leasing costs. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. See Note 18 Segment Information, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of NOI to our consolidated net income (loss) as defined by GAAP. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2024 to the Year Ended December 31, 2023 The following comparison for the year ended December 31, 2024 to the year ended December 31, 2023, makes reference to the effect of the following: (a) Same Store Property Portfolio, which represents 61 properties containing an aggregate of approximately 11.5 million net rentable square feet that we owned and consolidated for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Same Store Property Portfolio includes properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2023 and owned and consolidated through December 31, 2024, excluding properties classified as held for sale, (b) Total Portfolio, which represents all properties owned and consolidated by us during 2024 and 2023, (c) Recently Completed/Acquired Properties, which represents three properties placed into service or acquired on or subsequent to January 1, 2023, (d) Development/Redevelopment Properties, which represents zero properties currently in development/redevelopment. A property is excluded from our Same Store Property Portfolio and moved into Development/Redevelopment in the period that we determine to proceed with development/redevelopment for a future development strategy, and (e) 2023 and 2024 Dispositions, which represents four properties disposed of during 2023 and 2024. 38 Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2024 to the Year Ended December 31, 2023 Same Store Property Portfolio Recently Completed/Acquired Properties Development/Redevelopment Properties Other (Eliminations) (a) Total Portfolio (dollars and square feet in millions except per share amounts) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 $ Change % Change Revenue: Rents $ 413.8 $ 417.3 $ (3.5) (0.8) % $ 16.7 $ 9.4 $ $ $ 38.7 $ 53.1 $ 469.2 $ 479.8 $ (10.6) (2.2) % Third party management fees, labor reimbursement and leasing % 23.7 24.4 23.7 24.4 (0.7) (2.9) % Other 1.1 1.1 % 11.5 9.4 12.6 10.5 2.1 20.0 % Total revenue 414.9 418.4 (3.5) (0.8) % 16.7 9.4 73.9 86.9 505.5 514.7 (9.2) (1.8) % Property operating expenses 111.0 111.2 (0.2) (0.2) % 3.3 1.6 15.6 17.1 129.9 129.9 % Real estate taxes 42.3 43.2 (0.9) (2.1) % 1.2 0.5 4.2 6.3 47.7 50.0 (2.3) (4.6) % Third party management expenses % 9.7 10.1 9.7 10.1 (0.4) (4.0) % Net operating income 261.6 264.0 (2.4) (0.9) % 12.2 7.3 44.4 53.4 318.2 324.7 (6.5) (2.0) % Depreciation and amortization 144.9 148.9 (4.0) (2.7) % 9.4 6.4 23.9 33.5 178.2 188.8 (10.6) (5.6) % General & administrative expenses 42.8 34.8 42.8 34.8 8.0 23.0 % Provision for impairment 44.7 131.6 44.7 131.6 (86.9) (66.0) % Net gain on disposition of real estate (2.3) (7.7) 5.4 (70.1) % Net gain on sale of undepreciated real estate (1.2) 1.2 (100.0) % Operating income (loss) $ 116.7 $ 115.1 $ 1.6 1.4 % $ 2.8 $ 0.9 $ $ $ (67.0) $ (146.5) $ 54.8 $ (21.6) $ 76.4 (353.7) % Number of properties 61 61 3 64 Square feet 11.5 11.5 0.6 12.1 Core Occupancy % (b) 87.6 % 89.0 % 56.4 % Other Income (Expense): Interest and investment income 3.8 1.7 2.1 123.5 % Interest expense (116.3) (95.5) (20.8) 21.8 % Interest expense Deferred financing costs (5.0) (4.4) (0.6) 13.6 % Equity in loss of unconsolidated real estate ventures (191.6) (77.9) (113.7) 146.0 % Net gain on real estate venture transactions 56.8 0.2 56.6 28,300.0 % Gain on early extinguishment of debt 1.0 0.2 0.8 400.0 % Income tax provision (0.1) 0.1 (100.0) % Net loss $ (196.5) $ (197.4) $ 0.9 (0.5) % Net loss attributable to Common Shareholders of Brandywine Realty Trust $ (1.14) $ (1.15) $ 0.01 (0.9) % (a) Represents certain revenues and expenses at the corporate level as well as various intercompany costs that are eliminated in consolidation, third-party management fees, provisions for impairment, and changes in the accrued rent receivable allowance.

Total Revenue Rents from the Total Portfolio decreased $(10.6) million primarily as a result of the following: $6.6 million decrease due to the sales of 200 North Radnor Chester Road, Radnor, PA and 8521 Leesburg Pike, Vienna, VA in the fourth quarter of 2023 and T hree Barton Skyway, Austin, TX in the third quarter of 2023; $3.3 million decrease due to the sale of five Class B office properties in the Plymouth Meeting Executive Center in Plymouth Meeting, PA in the third quarter of 2024; $2.5 million decrease due to the early termination of a single tenant occupant at a property in our Austin, Texas segment in the third quarter of 2023; and $7.3 million increase relate Recently Completed/Acquired Properties which comprise 250 King of Prussia Road, Radnor, PA, 155 King of Prussia Road, Radnor, PA and 2340 Dulles Corner Boulevard, Herndon VA. The remaining $5.5 million decrease in Rents is primarily due to increase vacancies across our Same Store Property Portfolio. 39 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily as a result of the following: $5.6 million decrease related to the reduction in the cost basis of assets as a result of the provision for impairment recorded on two properties in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C. area within our Other segment in 2023; $4.0 million decrease related to accelerated depreciation on tenant improvements due to the early termination of a single tenant occupant at a property in our Austin, Texas segment in 2023; $2.9 million decrease related to the sales of three properties in 2023; $2.0 million decrease due to the sale of five Class B office properties in the Plymouth Meeting Executive Center in Plymouth Meeting, PA in the third quarter of 2024; and $3.0 million increase due to the placement into service of our Recently Completed/Acquired Properties. General & Administrative Expenses General and Administrative Expenses increase is primarily as a result of increased deferred compensation expenses. Provision for Impairment During the fourth quarter of 2024, we recognized a provision for impairment of $17.3 million on two office properties sold during the fourth quarter of 2024 located in our Austin, Texas segment. During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a provision for impairment of $3.8 million on six properties sold during the third quarter of 2024, five of which were located in our Pennsylvania Suburbs segment and one of which was located in our Other segment . In addition, during the third quarter of 2024, w e recognized a provision for impairment of $23.5 million on one property in our Other segment. The estimated fair value for this property was based upon a purchase and sale agreement pending as of September 30, 2024. The purchase and sale agreement was terminated during the fourth quarter of 2024 and the property currently remains in our portfolio. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized a provision for impairment of $103.2 million on three properties in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C. area within our Other segment. These impairments resulted from the shortened hold period assumptions for the assets as a result of our plan to exit these markets. Additionally, we recognized a provision for impairment of $12.3 million on an office property located within our Other segment, prior to sale. During the third quarter of 2023, we recognized a provision for impairment of $11.7 million on office properties located in our Pennsylvania Suburbs segment. The estimated fair value was based upon a pending purchase and sale agreement as of September 30, 2023 that was not completed as of December 31, 2023 due to the termination of the purchase and sale agreement. During the second quarter of 2023, we recognized a provision for impairment of $4.5 million on an office property located in our Austin Texas, segment which met the held for sale criteria as of June 30, 2023 and was sold during the three months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 3 Real Estate Investments, for further information. Net Gain on Disposition of Real Estate The $2.3 million gain on disposition of real estate for 2024 is due to the sale of a parking lot property in Richmond, VA for a gross sales price of $8.5 million and net cash proceeds of $8.3 million. The $7.7 million gain on disposition of real estate for 2023 is due to the sale of a retail building located at 200 North Radnor Chester Road, Radnor, PA for a gross sales price of $14.2 million and net cash proceeds of $13.8 million. Interest Expense Interest expense increased primarily due to our issuance of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 Notes in April 2024, partially offset by the tender offer and redemption of our $350 million 4.10% Guaranteed Notes due 2024 in June 2024. Additionally, interest expense increased during the third quarter of 2023 when Moody downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from Baa3 to Ba1. As a result of the downgrade, the interest rate on our 2028 Notes increased 25 basis points in September 2023 due to the coupon adjustment provisions within the 2028 Notes. During the first quarter of 2024, S&P downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from BBB- to BB+. As a result of the downgrade, the interest rate on the 2028 Notes increased 25 basis points to 8.05% in March 2024 due to the coupon adjustment provisions within the 2028 Notes. During the second quarter of 2024, Moody's downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from Ba1 to Ba2. As a result of the downgrade, the interest rate on the 2028 Notes increased 25 basis points to 8.30% in April 2024 due to the coupon adjustment provisions within the 2028 Notes. 40 Equity in Loss of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures Equity in loss of real estate ventures increased primarily due to our recognition of an impairment charge on the properties in our Commerce Square Venture and JBG Venture. Additionally, the increased losses from our unconsolidated real estate ventures are due to higher interest rates on the ventures outstanding indebtedness. See Note 4 Investment in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Net Gain on Real Estate Venture Transactions On June 28, 2024, we recapitalized our Original MAP Venture, in which we had a negative investment balance of $52.2 million as of March 31, 2024. In connection with the recapitalization, we recognized a one-time, non-cash gain of $53.8 million in connection with the derecognition of the negative investment balance in the Original MAP Venture. See Note 4 Investment in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 41 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES General Our principal liquidity funding needs for the next twelve months are as follows: normal recurring expenses; capital expenditures, including capital and tenant improvements and leasing costs; debt service and principal repayment obligations; current development and redevelopment costs; commitments to unconsolidated real estate ventures; distributions to shareholders to maintain our REIT status; possible acquisitions of properties, either directly or indirectly through the acquisition of equity interest therein; and possible common share repurchases. We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: cash flows from operations; distributions of cash from our unconsolidated real estate ventures; cash and cash equivalent balances; availability under our unsecured credit facility; secured construction loans and long-term unsecured indebtedness; sales of real estate or contributions of interests in real estate to joint ventures; and issuances of Parent Company equity securities and/or units of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2024, the Parent Company owned a 99.7% interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining interest of approximately 0.3% pertains to common limited partnership interests owned by non-affiliated investors who contributed property to the Operating Partnership in exchange for their interests. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company has full and complete responsibility for the Operating Partnership day-to-day operations and management. The Parent Company source of funding for its dividend payments and other obligations is the distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership. As summarized above, we believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied through available cash balances and cash flows from operations, financing activities and real estate sales. Rental revenue and other income from operations are our principal sources of cash to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distributions required to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to increase cash flows from our properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our revenue also includes third-party fees generated by our property management, leasing, development and construction businesses. We believe that our revenue, together with proceeds from property sales and debt financings, will continue to provide funds for our short-term liquidity needs. However, material changes in our operating or financing activities may adversely affect our net cash flows. With uncertain economic conditions, vacancy rates may increase, effective rental rates on new and renewed leases may decrease and tenant installation costs, including concessions, may increase in most or all of our markets during 2025 and possibly beyond. As a result, our revenues and cash flows could be insufficient to cover operating expenses, including increased tenant installation costs, pay debt service or make distributions to shareholders over the short-term. If this situation were to occur, we expect that we would finance cash deficits through borrowings under our unsecured credit facility and other sources of debt and equity financings. In addition, a material adverse change in cash provided by operations could adversely affect our compliance with financial performance covenants under our unsecured credit facility, including unsecured term loans and unsecured notes. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and requirement obligations. On January 19, 2023, we closed on a term loan secured by seven operating properties with an aggregate principal amount of $245.0 million (the Secured Facility ). The Secured Facility matures on February 6, 2028. We used the net proceeds from the Secured Facility for general corporate purposes, including to reduce outstanding borrowings under our unsecured credit facility. See Note 8 Debt Obligations, for further information. On March 1, 2023, we closed on an unsecured term loan with a principal amount of $70.0 million (the Unsecured Term Loan ). The Unsecured Term Loan has a scheduled maturity date of February 28, 2024 with an option to extend for twelve months and bears interest at Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.75% with a 0.10% SOFR adjustment. The Company exercised its 42 option to extend the Facility for an additional twelve months on January 24, 2024. See Note 8 Debt Obligations, for further information. On August 15, 2023, we entered into a construction loan agreement secured by the development project at 155 King of Prussia Road in Radnor, Pennsylvania in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the Construction Loan ). The Construction Loan has a scheduled maturity date of August 16, 2026 with an option to prepay at any time without a fee, premium or penalty. The Construction Loan bears interest at SOFR plus 2.5%. On April 12, 2024, we completed an underwritten offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.875% Guaranteed Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes ). The 2029 Notes were priced at approximately 99.51% of their face amount. We received approximately $391.8 million of net proceeds after the deduction for underwriting discounts and offering expenses. On April 15, 2024, we commenced a tender offer (the Tender Offer ) for any and all of the outstanding $335.1 million principal amount of our 4.10% Guaranteed Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Notes ). The purchase price offered per $1,000 principal amount of 2024 Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer was determined by reference to the fixed spread for the 2024 Notes of 0 basis points plus the yield based on the bid-side price of the 4.250% U.S. Treasury due September 30, 2024. The Tender Offer expired on April 19, 2024. Upon completion of the Tender Offer, on April 23, 2024, the Company issued a redemption notice to redeem any 2024 Notes that remained outstanding after the Tender Offer. On June 7, 2024, we redeemed the remaining $113.4 million of our 2024 Bonds at the aggregate principal amount outstanding together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. Our outstanding 7.55% Guaranteed Notes due 2028 (the 2028 Notes ) include an interest rate adjustment provision whereby the interest rate payable on the 2028 Notes is subject to a 25 basis point adjustment if either Moody's Investors Services Inc, and its successors ("Moody's"), or S&P Global Ratings, and its successors ("S&P") downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the 2028 Notes. During the third quarter of 2023, Moody downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from Baa3 to Ba1. As a result of the downgrade, the interest rate on the 2028 Notes increased 25 basis points to 7.80% in September 2023. In January 2024, S&P downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from BBB- to BB+. As a result of the downgrade, the interest rate on the 2028 Notes increased 25 basis points to 8.05% in March 2024. During the second quarter of 2024, Moody's downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from Ba1 to Ba2. As a result of the downgrade, the interest rate on the 2028 Notes increased 25 basis points to 8.30% in April 2024 due to the coupon adjustment provisions within the 2028 Notes. Our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors, including our credit ratings, the value of our unencumbered assets, our degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by our lenders. If one or more rating agencies were to downgrade our unsecured credit rating, our access to the unsecured debt market would be more limited and the interest rate under our unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loan would increase. As of December 31, 2024, our senior unsecured credit ratings and outlook were as follows: Moody's S&P Long-term debt Ba2 BB+ Outlook Stable Negative If our credit ratings are lowered further, our ability to access the public debt markets, our costs of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit ratings agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same. We use multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. When needed, we use borrowings under our unsecured credit facility for general business purposes, including to meet debt maturities and to fund distributions to shareholders as well as development and acquisition costs and other expenses. In light of the volatility in financial markets and economic uncertainties, it is possible, that one or more lenders under our unsecured credit facility could fail to fund a borrowing request. Such an event could adversely affect our ability to access funds under our unsecured credit facility when needed to fund distributions or pay expenses. Our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors, including our credit ratings, the value of our unencumbered assets, our degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by our lenders. If one or more rating 43 agencies were to downgrade our unsecured credit rating, our access to the unsecured debt market would be more limited and the interest rate under our unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loan would increase. The Parent Company unconditionally guarantees the Operating Partnership unsecured debt obligations, which, as of December 31, 2024, amounted to $1,948.6 million. The Operating Partnership secured debt obligations as of December 31, 2024 amounted to $277.7 million. Capital Markets The Parent Company issues equity from time to time, the proceeds of which it contributes to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional interests in the Operating Partnership, and guarantees debt obligations of the Operating Partnership. The Parent Company ability to sell common shares and preferred shares is dependent on, among other things, general market conditions for REITs, market perceptions about the Company as a whole, and the current trading price of the Parent Company shares. The Parent Company maintains a shelf registration statement that covers the offering and sale of common shares, preferred shares, depositary shares, warrants and unsecured debt securities. Subject to our ongoing compliance with securities laws, and if warranted by market conditions, we may offer and sell equity and debt securities from time to time under the shelf registration statement or in transactions exempt from registration. See Note 12 Beneficiaries' Equity of the Parent Company, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our share repurchase program. We expect to fund any additional share repurchases with a combination of available cash balances and availability under our unsecured credit facility. The timing and amounts of any repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements, share prices, capital availability and other factors as determined by our management team. The repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. Liquidity The Operating Partnership also considers net sales of selected properties and recapitalization of unconsolidated real estate ventures as additional sources of managing its liquidity. During the year ended December 31, 2024 we completed the sales of the Plymouth Meeting Executive Center, comprised of five office properties totaling a 521,288 square feet located in Plymouth Meeting, PA for a gross sales price of $65.5 million, One and Two Barton, comprised of two office properties totaling 390,963 square feet in Austin, TX for a gross sales price of $107.6 million, 55 US Avenue, 11.0 Acres of land located in Gibbsboro, NJ for a gross sales price of $6.5 million, and Dabney Land Westwood, 11.0 Acres parking lot in Richmond VA for a gross sales price of $8.5 million. As of December 31, 2024, we had $90.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $560.8 million of available borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, net of $39.2 million in letters of credit outstanding. Based on the foregoing, as well as cash flows from operations net of dividend requirements, we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our remaining capital requirements on existing development and redevelopment projects and pursue additional attractive investment opportunities. We expect that our primary uses of capital during 2025 will be to fund our current development and redevelopment projects. Cash Flows The following discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statement of cash flows and is not meant to be a comprehensive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the years presented. 44 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we maintained cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $96.2 million and $67.5 million, respectively. We report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. The following table summarizes changes in our cash flows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Activity 2024 2023 (Decrease) Increase Operating $ 181,125 $ 177,273 $ 3,852 Investing (120,185) (174,912) 54,727 Financing (32,297) 46,786 (79,083) Net cash flows $ 28,643 $ 49,147 $ (20,504) Our principal source of cash flows is from the leasing of space at our Properties. Our Properties provide a relatively consistent stream of cash flows that provides us with the resources to fund operating expenses, debt service and quarterly dividends. The increase in operating cash flows is primarily due to the decrease in average occupancy in 2024 compared to 2023. Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development, or redevelopment projects and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that we expect will enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing, and property management skills and invest in existing buildings that meet our investment criteria for additional capital. During the year ended December 31, 2024, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, the change in investing cash flows was due to the following activities (in thousands): (Decrease) Increase Acquisitions of real estate $ 7,747 Capital expenditures and capitalized interest 26,700 Capital improvements/acquisition deposits/leasing costs (3,481) Joint venture investments (108,105) Proceeds from the sale of properties 79,063 Capital distributions from unconsolidated real estate ventures 52,803 Decrease in net cash used in investing activities $ 54,727 We generally fund our investment activity through the sale of real estate, property-level financing, credit facilities, senior unsecured notes, and construction loans. From time to time, we may issue common or preferred shares of beneficial interest, or the Operating Partnership may issue common or preferred units of limited partnership interest. During the year ended December 31, 2024, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, the change in financing cash flows was due to the following activities (in thousands): (Decrease) Increase Proceeds from debt obligations $ 76,087 Repayments of debt obligations (172,395) Redemption of limited partnership units 5 Debt financing costs paid (1,963) Dividends and distributions paid 19,840 Other financing activities (657) Increase in net cash used in financing activities $ (79,083) 45 Capitalization Indebtedness The table below summarizes indebtedness under our unsecured debt at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023: December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands) Balance: (a) Fixed rate $ 2,123,610 $ 1,985,000 Variable rate - unhedged (b) (c) 102,734 162,434 Total $ 2,226,344 $ 2,147,434 Percent of Total Debt: Fixed rate 95.4 % 92.4 % Variable rate - unhedged 4.6 % 7.6 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % Weighted-average interest rate at period end: Fixed rate 6.2 % 5.1 % Variable rate - unhedged 6.5 % 7.1 % Total 6.2 % 5.2 % Weighted-average maturity in years: Fixed rate 3.8 3.8 Variable rate - unhedged 0.6 6.3 Total 3.7 4.0 (a) Consists of unpaid principal and does not reflect premium/discount or deferred financing costs. (b) On November 23, 2022, the unsecured term loan of $250.0 million was swapped to a fixed rate. At December 31, 2024, the fixed rate for this instrument was 5.41% and matures on June 30, 2027. The effective date of the swap was January 31, 2023. (c) On January 16, 2024, the Trust Preferred I - Indenture IA was swapped to a fixed rate at 5.14% for the period from March 30, 2024 to December 30, 2026 and Trust Preferred I - Indenture IB and Trust Preferred II - Indenture II were swapped to a fixed rate at 5.24% for the period from January 30, 2024 to January 30, 2027. Scheduled principal payments and related weighted average annual effective interest rates for our debt as of December 31, 2024 were as follows (dollars in thousands): Period Principal maturities Weighted Average Interest Rate of Maturing Debt 2025 $ 70,000 6.3 % 2026 32,734 7.1 % 2027 700,000 4.5 % 2028 595,000 7.4 % 2029 750,000 6.8 % 2030 % 2031 % 2032 % 2033 % 2034 % Thereafter 78,610 5.2 % Totals $ 2,226,344 6.2 % Unsecured Debt The Operating Partnership is the issuer of our unsecured notes which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company. The indenture under which the Operating Partnership issued its unsecured notes contains financial covenants, including: (i) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%; (ii) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 40%; (iii) a debt service 46 coverage ratio of greater than 1.5 to 1.0; and (iv) an unencumbered asset value of not less than 150% of unsecured debt. The Operating Partnership is in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2024. The charter documents of the Parent Company and Operating Partnership do not limit the amount or form of indebtedness that the Operating Partnership may incur, and its policies on debt incurrence are solely within the discretion of the Parent Company Board of Trustees, subject to the financial covenants in the Credit Facility, indenture and other credit agreements. Equity In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Parent Company is required to, among other things, pay dividends to its shareholders of at least 90% of its REIT taxable income. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Parent Company paid dividends in excess of the 90% criterion. See Note 12 Beneficiaries' Equity of the Parent Company, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our dividends declared for the fourth quarter of 2024. Inflation and Lease Pass-Through Provisions Substantially all our leases are structured as base year or triple net leases which provide for reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per square-foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above certain per square-foot allowances. In addition, as of December 31, 2024, approximately 96% of our leases (as a percentage of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our wholly-owned portfolio) contain annual rent escalations that are either fixed (generally ranging from 2.0% to 3.0% per lease year) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other indices. We believe such lease provisions mitigate adverse impacts of inflation on our earnings from real estate operations. However, recent inflation and higher interest rates have caused an increase in our borrowing costs, including on our variable rate debt, and on our operating expenses that are not subject to the lease pass-through provisions. While we have experienced increased inflation, our Same Store Property Portfolio operating margins remained consistent at 63.1% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to the expense reimbursement provisions noted above. The expense reimbursement provisions in our leases resulted in Same Store Property Portfolio operating expense recovery rates of 52.7% and 52.9% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Contractual Obligations We provide customary guarantees for certain development projects of our unconsolidated real estate ventures. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on payment guarantees provided on the behalf of real estate ventures. In connection with the Schuylkill Yards Project, we entered into a neighborhood engagement program and, as of December 31, 2024, had $5.2 million of future contractual obligations. We are also committed to making additional contributions under the program. We estimate that, as of December 31, 2024, these additional contributions, which are not fixed under the terms of agreement, will be $2.0 million. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We have committed to contribute $15.0 million to a newly-formed venture capital fund that invests in early-stage life science companies. As of December 31, 2024 we had funded $2.7 million of the foregoing commitment. As part of our September 2004 acquisition of a portfolio of properties (which we refer to as the TRC acquisition ), we acquired our interest in Two Logan Square, a 708,844 square foot office building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania primarily through ownership of a second and third mortgage secured by this property. This property is consolidated, as the borrower is a VIE and we, through our ownership of the second and third mortgages, are the primary beneficiary. On October 21, 2020, we also acquired the $79.8 million first mortgage on the property from the third-party mortgage lender pursuant to an agreement with certain of the former owners. Under the agreement, we have agreed to not take title to Two Logan until the earlier of June 2026 or the occurrence of certain events related to the ownership interests of certain former owners. If we were to sell the restricted property before the expiration of the restricted period in a non-exempt transaction, we may be required to make significant payments to certain of the former owners of Two Logan Square on account of tax liabilities attributed to them. Additionally, we will be required to pay these certain former owners an amount estimated at approximately 47 $0.6 million to redeem their residual interest in the fee owner of this property. The $0.6 million payment is included within Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. As part of our acquisition of properties, from time to time in tax-deferred transactions, we have agreed to provide certain of the prior owners of the acquired properties the right to guarantee our indebtedness. If we were to seek to repay the indebtedness guaranteed by the prior owner before the expiration of the applicable agreement, we would be required to provide the prior owner an opportunity to guaranty qualifying replacement debt. These debt maintenance agreements may limit our ability to refinance indebtedness on terms favorable to us. We invest in properties and regularly incur capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business to maintain the properties. We believe that such expenditures enhance our competitiveness. We also enter into construction, utility and service contracts in the ordinary course of its business which may extend beyond one year. These contracts typically provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. In addition, during construction undertaken by real estate ventures we have provided, and expect to continue to provide, cost overrun, and completion guarantees, with rights of contribution among partners in ventures, as well as customary environmental indemnities and guarantees of customary exceptions to nonrecourse provisions in loan agreements. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on payment guarantees provided on the behalf of real estate ventures. Interest Rate Risk and Sensitivity Analysis The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the Operating Partnership financial instruments to selected changes in market rates. The range of changes chosen reflects its view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates chosen. Our financial instruments consist of both fixed and variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2024, our consolidated debt consisted of (i) unsecured notes with an outstanding principal balance of $1,550.0 million, all of which are fixed rate borrowings, (ii) variable rate debt consisting of trust preferred securities that have been swapped to fixed rates with an outstanding principal balance of $78.6 million, (iii) a $600.0 million Credit Facility with no outstanding borrowings, (iv) a secured fixed rate term loan with an outstanding principal balance of $245.0 million, (v) a construction loan for the property at 155 King of Prussia Road with an outstanding balance of $32.7 million and (v) two unsecured term loans of $250.0 million and $70.0 million. The $250.0 million unsecured term loan has been swapped to a fixed rate. All financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes and the net market value of these financial instruments is referred to as the net financial position. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position, but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows, but does not impact the net financial instrument position. As of December 31, 2024, based on prevailing interest rates and credit spreads, the fair value of our unsecured notes was $1,537.2 million. For sensitivity purposes, a 100 basis point change in the discount rate equates to a change in the total fair value of our debt of approximately $15.4 million at December 31, 2024. From time to time or as the need arises, we use derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk exposures and not for speculative or trading purposes. The total outstanding principal balance of our variable rate debt was approximately $431.3 million as of December 31, 2024. The total fair value of our variable rate debt was approximately $403.9 million at December 31, 2024. For sensitivity purposes, if market rates of interest increase by 100 basis points the fair value of our variable rate debt would decrease by approximately $10.9 million at December 31, 2024. If market rates of interest decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of our outstanding variable rate debt would increase by approximately $11.5 million at December 31, 2024. These amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure. 48 Funds from Operations (FFO) Pursuant to the revised definition of FFO adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ), we calculate FFO by adjusting net income/(loss) attributable to common unit holders (computed in accordance with GAAP) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable consolidated real estate, impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated real estate ventures, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated real estate ventures. Our calculation of FFO includes gains from sale of undepreciated real estate and other assets, considered incidental to our main business, to third parties or unconsolidated real estate ventures. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the use of FFO combined with the required GAAP presentations has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REITs operating results more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding property impairments, gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. We consider net income, as defined by GAAP, to be the most comparable earnings measure to FFO. While FFO and FFO per unit are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, FFO does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income/(loss) attributable to common unit holders and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to common unitholders to FFO for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023: Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 (amounts in thousands, except share information) Net loss attributable to common unitholders $ (197,670) $ (197,948) Add (deduct): Amount allocated to unvested restricted unitholders 1,178 567 Net gain on real estate venture transactions (63,696) (181) Net gain on disposition of real estate (2,297) (7,736) Provision for impairment 44,101 131,573 Company's share of impairment of an unconsolidated real estate venture 147,184 37,175 Depreciation and amortization: Real property 154,945 159,213 Leasing costs including acquired intangibles 19,746 26,131 Company share of unconsolidated real estate ventures 47,013 50,565 Partners share of consolidated real estate ventures (9) (20) Funds from operations $ 150,495 $ 199,339 Funds from operations allocable to unvested restricted shareholders (1,624) (1,043) Funds from operations available to common share and unit holders (FFO) $ 148,871 $ 198,296 Weighted-average shares/units outstanding basic (a) 173,042,591 172,475,645 Weighted-average shares/units outstanding fully diluted (a) 175,969,844 173,046,299 (a) Includes common shares and partnership units outstanding through the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
