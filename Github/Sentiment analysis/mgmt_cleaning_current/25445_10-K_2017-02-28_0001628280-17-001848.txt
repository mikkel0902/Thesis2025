Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are a diversified manufacturer of highly engineered industrial products. Our business consists of four segments: Fluid Handling, Payment & Merchandising Technologies, Aerospace & Electronics and Engineered Materials. Our primary markets are chemical, power, oil & gas, aerospace & defense, along with a wide range of general industrial and consumer related end markets. Our strategy is to grow earnings and cash flow by focusing on the manufacturing of highly engineered industrial products for specific markets where our scale is a relative advantage, and where we can compete based on our proprietary and differentiated technology, our deep vertical expertise, and our responsiveness to unique and diverse customer needs. We continuously evaluate our portfolio, pursue acquisitions that complement our existing businesses and are accretive to our growth profile, selectively divest businesses where appropriate, and pursue internal mergers to improve efficiency. We strive to foster a performance-based culture focused on productivity and continuous improvement, to attract and retain a committed management team whose interests are directly aligned with those of our shareholders, and to maintain a focused, efficient corporate structure. We will continue to execute this strategy while remaining committed to the values of our founder, R.T. Crane, who resolved to conduct business "in the strictest honesty and fairness; to avoid all deception and trickery; to deal fairly with both customers and competitors; to be liberal and just toward employees; and to put my whole mind upon the business." Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this report may not add up precisely to totals we provide and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.

Page 19 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Items Affecting Comparability of Reported Results The comparability of our results from operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is affected by the following significant items: Asbestos Charge In 2016, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $192 million associated with extending the time horizon of our estimated asbestos liability through the generally accepted end point in 2059, reflecting stabilization in key trends such as indemnity and defense costs, and the number of claims filed against us. Please refer to Note 10, "Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the asbestos charge. Huttig Legal Settlement Charge In 2016, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $5 million associated with the legal settlement of a matter with Huttig Building Products, Inc. ( Huttig ). Please refer to Note 10, "Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the legal settlement charge. Acquisition-Related Costs - MEI During 2015 and 2014, we recorded pre-tax integration costs of $7 million and $10 million, respectively. In 2014, we also recorded pre-tax acquisition related inventory and backlog amortization of $5 million. Restructuring Charges and Related Costs In 2015, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges and related costs of $11 million, substantially all of which was related to the repositioning activities in our Fluid Handling and Aerospace & Electronics segments. In 2014, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges and related costs of $33.0 million, of which $23 million was related to the repositioning activities in our Fluid Handling and Aerospace & Electronics segments and $10 million was related to the acquisition of MEI. Please refer to Note 14, "Restructuring Charges and Acquisition Integration Costs" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Charge In 2014, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $49 million to extend accrued costs to 2022 at the Goodyear Site; we also recorded a $7 million charge for expected remediation costs associated with the Roseland Site which are expected to be completed by 2017. Please refer to Note 10, "Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Goodyear Site and Roseland Site. Lawsuit Settlement Charge In 2014, we recorded a pre-tax lawsuit settlement charge of $6.5 million related to the Roseland Site. Please refer to Note 10, "Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Roseland Site. 2016 compared with 2015 Sales increased by $8 million to $2,748 million in 2016. Net sales related to operations outside the United States for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 36% and 38% of total net sales, respectively. The year-over-year change in sales included: an increase in core sales of $56 million , or 2% , largely offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $48 million , or 2% ; Operating profit decreased by $173 million , or 46% , to $200 million in 2016. The decrease primarily related to the $192 million asbestos charge recorded in 2016, together with lower operating profit in our Fluid Handling segment and higher corporate costs, which included the $5.0 million Huttig legal settlement charge. These decreases were partially offset by increases in our Payment & Merchandising Technologies, Aerospace & Electronics and Engineered Materials segments. 2015 compared with 2014 Sales decreased by $185 million, or 6%, to $2,741 million in 2015. Net sales related to operations outside the United States for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 38% and 41% of total net sales, respectively. The year-over-year change in sales included: a decline in core sales of $35 million, or 1%; unfavorable foreign currency translation of $134 million, or 5%; the impact of the divestiture of Crane Water and the completion of a previously disclosed transition services agreement of $15 million, or 0.5%. Page 20 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating profit increased by $57 million, or 18%, to $373 million in 2015. The increase in operating profit reflected the absence of environmental charges and a lawsuit settlement recorded in 2014, coupled with higher operating profit in our Payment & Merchandising Technologies, Engineered Materials and Aerospace & Electronics segments, partially offset by lower operating profit in our Fluid Handling segment. (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Net income before allocation to noncontrolling interests $ 123.8 $ 230.0 $ 193.6 Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax Currency translation adjustment (64.7 ) (70.1 ) (114.0 ) Changes in pension and postretirement plan assets and benefit obligation, net of tax benefit (35.2 ) (8.4 ) (136.5 ) Other comprehensive loss, net of tax (99.9 ) (78.5 ) (250.5 ) Comprehensive income (loss) before allocation to noncontrolling interests 23.9 151.5 (56.9 ) Less: Noncontrolling interests in comprehensive income (loss) 1.0 1.1 0.9 Comprehensive income (loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 22.9 $ 150.4 $ (57.8 ) 2016 compared with 2015 For the year ended December 31, 2016, comprehensive income before allocations to noncontrolling interests was $23.9 million compared to $151.5 million in 2015. The change was primarily driven by a $106.2 million decrease in net income before allocation to noncontrolling interests, which included a $125 million after-tax asbestos charge, and to a lesser extent, an increase in unamortized losses on pension plans. The unrealized loss on foreign currency translation adjustments of the balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries from local currencies to U.S. dollars was primarily due to weakening of the British pound and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. 2015 compared with 2014 For the year ended December 31, 2015, comprehensive income before allocations to noncontrolling interests was $151.5 million compared to a loss of $56.9 million in 2014. The comprehensive income before allocations to noncontrolling interests was a result of net income before allocations to noncontrolling interests of $230.0 million, partially offset by foreign currency translation adjustments of $70.1 million and unamortized losses on pension plans of $8.4 million. The unrealized loss on foreign currency translation adjustments of the balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries from local currencies to U.S. dollars was primarily due to the weakening of the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. The unamortized losses on pension plans were primarily due to a decrease in assumed discount rates, lower than expected return on pension plan assets, and the adoption of revised actuarial mortality tables in 2014. Page 21 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FLUID HANDLING (in millions, except %) 2016 2015 2014 Net sales by product line: Process Valves and Related Products $ 619 $ 681 $ 805 Commercial Valves 291 316 362 Other Products 89 94 96 Total net sales 999 1,091 1,264 Operating profit 120 125 182 Restructuring and related charges* 10 15 Assets 846 888 963 Operating margin 12.0 % 11.5 % 14.4 % * Restructuring and related charges are included in operating profit and operating margin. 2016 compared with 2015 Fluid Handling sales decreased by $92 million , or 8% , to $999 million , driven by a core sales decline of $61 million , or 6% , and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $31 million , or 2%. Sales of Process Valves and Related Products decreased by $62 million , or 9% , to $619 million in 2016, including a core sales decline of $55 million , or 8% , and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $ 7 million , or 1% . The decrease in core sales primarily reflected lower sales in oil & gas, chemical, power, and general industrial end markets. The unfavorable foreign currency translation was primarily a result of the British pound weakening against the U.S. dollar. Sales of Commercial Valves decreased by $25 million, or 8% , to $291 million in 2016, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $23 million , or 7% , primarily reflecting the British pound weakening against the U.S. dollar, with an additional impact from the weakening of the Canadian dollar. Core sales decreased $2 million , or 1% , primarily reflecting lower sales in non-residential construction end markets in Canada. Sales of Other Products decreased by $5 million, or 5% , to $89 million in 2016, primarily reflecting a core sales decline of $4 million , or 4% , and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $1 million , or 1% . The lower core sales were primarily a result of lower sales to military customers following particularly strong sales to that market in 2015, as well as lower sales to non-residential construction markets. Fluid Handling operating profit decreased by $5 million, or 5% , to $120 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily a result of lower volume, competitive pricing and unfavorable foreign exchange, largely offset by productivity, savings from repositioning actions, favorable mix, and lower restructuring and related charges. 2015 compared with 2014 Fluid Handling sales decreased by $172 million, or 14%, to $1,091 million, driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $89 million, or 7%, a core sales decline of $78 million, or 6%, and the impact of the divestiture of Crane Water of $5 million, or 0.4%. Sales of Process Valves and Related Products decreased by $124 million, or 15%, to $681 million in 2015, including a core sales decline of $75 million, or 9%, and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $49 million, or 6%, as both the British pound and euro weakened against the U.S. dollar. The decrease in core sales reflected lower sales in chemical, oil and gas, power, and general industrial end markets. The lower sales were driven by a significant decline in global oil prices and weaker economic conditions in Europe and Asia. Sales of Commercial Valves decreased by $46 million, or 13%, to $316 million in 2015, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency translation of $39 million, or 11%, as the British pound and Canadian dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar. Core sales decreased $7 million, or 2%, reflecting lower sales in non-residential construction in the U.K. and municipal end markets in continental Europe. Page 22 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fluid Handling operating profit decreased by $56 million, or 31%, to $125 million in 2015. The decrease was driven by a $40 million impact from lower sales, unfavorable product mix, lower price and to a lesser extent, unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring and related charges. PAYMENT & MERCHANDISING TECHNOLOGIES (in millions, except %) 2016 2015 2014 Net sales by product line: Payment Acceptance and Dispensing Products $ 512 $ 496 $ 513 Merchandising Equipment 234 207 199 Total net sales 746 703 712 Operating profit 136 101 69 Acquisition, integration and restructuring related charges* 7 24 Assets 1,189 1,178 1,210 Operating margin 18.2 % 14.4 % 9.7 % * Acquisition, integration and restructuring related charges are included in operating profit and operating margin. 2016 compared with 2015 Payment & Merchandising Technologies sales increased by $43 million , or 6% , to $746 million in 2016, reflecting a core sales increase of $60 million , or 8% , partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $17 million , or 2% . Sales of Payment Acceptance and Dispensing Products increased $16 million , or 3% , to $512 million in 2016, driven by a core sales increase of $28 million , or 6% , primarily reflecting strength in the retail vertical.

Sales of Merchandising Equipment increased $27 million , or 13% , to $234 million in 2016, reflecting a core sales increase of $32 million , or 15% , partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $5 million , or 2% , primarily as a result of the British pound weakening against the U.S. dollar. The increase in core sales was primarily related to stronger sales to large bottler customers as well as full-line operators. Payment & Merchandising Technologies operating profit increased by $35 million, or 34% , to $136 million in 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the benefit from the higher core sales, the impact from MEI related synergy savings of $10 million and lower acquisition, integration and restructuring related charges of $7 million. 2015 compared with 2014 Payment & Merchandising Technologies sales decreased by $9 million, or 1%, to $703 million in 2015, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency translation of $42 million, or 6%, and the impact of a transition services agreement related to a divested product line of $10 million, or 1%, partially offset by a core sales increase of $43 million, or 6%. Sales of Payment Acceptance and Dispensing Products decreased $16 million, or 3%, to $496 million in 2015, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency translation of $38 million, or 7%, as the British pound, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, and euro weakened against the U.S. dollar, coupled with the aforementioned impact of a transition services agreement related to a divested product line which reduced sales by $10 million, or 2%. These decreases were partially offset by a core sales increase of $31 million, or 6%, reflecting higher sales in retail, gaming, vending, and transportation end markets, partially offset by lower sales to the financial services markets. Sales of Merchandising Equipment increased $8 million, or 4%, to $207 million in 2015, reflecting a core sales increase of $11 million, or 6%, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $4 million, or 2%, as the British pound weakened against the U.S. dollar. The increase in core sales reflected higher sales to certain large bottler customers as well as full-line operators in 2015. Payment & Merchandising Technologies operating profit increased by $32 million, or 47%, to $101 million in 2015. The increase was primarily driven by the impact from higher core sales, a decrease in acquisition, integration and restructuring related charges of $17 million and synergy savings of $14 million, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and unfavorable foreign exchange.

Sales of FRP to building products customers increased $1 million, or 2% , to $83 million in 2015, reflecting a modest recovery in commercial construction end markets in the United States. Engineered Materials operating profit increased by $12 million, or 32%, to $48 million in 2015, reflecting lower raw material costs, primarily resin, and strong productivity gains. Page 25 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CORPORATE (in millions, except %) 2016 2015 2014 Corporate expense $ (61 ) $ (48 ) $ (54 ) Corporate expense Asbestos (192 ) Corporate expense Environmental (56 ) Total Corporate (254 ) (48 ) (109 ) Interest income 2 2 2 Interest expense (37 ) (38 ) (39 ) Miscellaneous (expense) income (2 ) (1 ) 2 2016 compared with 2015 Total Corporate increased by $206 million in 2016, primarily due to an asbestos charge of $192 million and to a lesser extent, a $5.0 million legal settlement charge recorded in 2016, higher compensation costs and higher benefit costs. See Note 10, "Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the asbestos and legal settlement charges. 2015 compared with 2014 Total Corporate decreased by $62 million, or 56%, to $48 million in 2015, primarily due to the absence of the following 2014 charges: 1) $49 million related to an increase in our liability at our Goodyear Site; 2) $6.8 million for expected remediation costs associated with our Roseland Site, and 3) $6.5 million related to a lawsuit settlement. Income Tax (in millions, except %) 2016 2015 2014 Income before tax U.S. $ 63 $ 262 $ 142 Income before tax non-U.S. 101 75 139 Income before tax worldwide 164 337 281 Provision for income taxes 40 107 88 Effective tax rate 24.6 % 31.7 % 31.2 % Our effective tax rate is affected by a number of items, both recurring and discrete, including the amount of income we earn in different jurisdictions and their respective statutory tax rates, acquisitions and dispositions, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, regulations and accounting principles, the continued availability of statutory tax credits and deductions, the continued reinvestment of our overseas earnings, and examinations initiated by tax authorities around the world. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies included later in this Item 7 for additional information about our provision for income taxes. A reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in Note 2 "Income Taxes" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2016 compared with 2015 Our effective tax rate decreased from 2015 to 2016 largely due to proportionately more earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates, greater U.S. federal tax benefits from domestic manufacturing and R&D activities, and a discrete benefit recognized in 2016 as a result of the resolution of a tax examination. These items were partially offset by higher U.S. state taxes. 2015 compared with 2014 Our effective tax rate increased from 2014 to 2015 largely due to proportionality more earnings realized in countries that have higher statutory tax rates, partially offset by a larger U.S. federal tax benefit from domestic manufacturing activities. Page 26 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 318 $ 229 $ 264 Investing activities (51 ) (35 ) (26 ) Financing activities (100 ) (144 ) (133 ) Effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (21 ) (33 ) (30 ) Increase in cash and cash equivalents 146 17 76 Our operating philosophy is to deploy cash provided from operating activities, when appropriate, to provide value to shareholders by reinvesting in existing businesses, by making acquisitions that will complement our portfolio of businesses, by divesting businesses that are no longer strategic and by paying dividends and/or repurchasing shares. Our current cash balance, together with cash we expect to generate from future operations along with the $500 million available under our Commercial Paper Program (the CP Program ) or borrowings available under our revolving credit facility, is expected to be sufficient to finance our short- and long-term capital requirements, as well as to fund payments associated with our asbestos and environmental liabilities and expected pension contributions. In addition, we believe our investment grade credit ratings afford us adequate access to public and private debt markets. We have no borrowings outstanding under our CP Program as of December 31, 2016. There are no other significant debt maturities coming due until December 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we extended our estimate of the asbestos liability, including the costs of settlement or indemnity payments and defense costs relating to currently pending claims and future claims projected to be filed against us through the generally accepted end point of such claims in 2059. Our estimate of the asbestos liability for pending and future claims through 2059 is based on the projected future asbestos costs resulting from our experience using a range of reference periods for claims filed, settled and dismissed. Based on this estimate, we recorded an additional liability of $227 million (an aggregate asbestos liability of $696 million) as of December 31, 2016. We continue to monitor trend factors, such as the number and type of claims being filed each year, case management orders and legislation restricting the types of claims that can proceed to trial, significant appellate rulings and developments affecting the post-bankruptcy trusts for asbestos claimants to assess whether a change in the estimate is warranted. On a quarterly basis, we review significant changes to these factors in assessing the adequacy of our asbestos liability. Similarly, we have an estimated liability of $49 million related to environmental remediation costs projected through 2022 related to our Goodyear Site. As of December 31, 2016, our non-U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $464 million of cash, which would be subject to additional tax upon repatriation to the United States. Our current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from our non-U.S. operations to fund our U.S. operations. In the event we were to repatriate the cash balances of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. and non-U.S. taxes in connection with such repatriation. Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities, a key source of our liquidity, was $318 million in 2016, compared to $229 million in 2015. The increase in cash generated resulted primarily from lower working capital requirements, and to a lesser extent, lower pension contributions and environmental payments. Net asbestos-related payments in 2016 and 2015 were $56 million and $50 million , respectively. We expect to make payments related to asbestos settlement and defense costs, net of related insurance recoveries, of approximately $55 million, environmental payments of approximately $13 million and contributions to our defined benefit plans of approximately $12 million in 2017. Investing Activities Cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for capital expenditures, cash flows provided by divestitures of businesses or assets, and cash used for acquisitions. Cash used for investing activities was $51 million in 2016, compared to $35 million in 2015. The increase in cash used for investing activities was driven by higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development and improving information systems. We expect our capital expenditures to approximate $50 million in 2017, reflecting continued investments in new product development initiatives, primarily in our Aerospace & Electronics, Payment and Merchandising Technologies and Fluid Handling segments. Page 27 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of dividend payments to shareholders, share repurchases, repayments of indebtedness, proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Cash used for financing activities was $100 million in 2016, compared to $144 million in 2015. The lower levels of cash used for financing activities was primarily due to the absence of open market purchases of our common stock (we repurchased 398,095 shares of our common stock at a cost of $25 million in 2015) and higher proceeds from stock options exercised. Financing Arrangements Total debt was $745 million and $794 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our indebtedness as of December 31, 2016 was as follows: $249 million of 2.75% notes due 2018; $298 million of 4.45% notes due 2023; $198 million of 6.55% notes due 2036; 2.75% notes due December 2018 - In December 2013, we issued five year notes having an aggregate principal amount of $250 million. The notes are unsecured, senior obligations that mature on December 15, 2018 and bear interest at 2.75% per annum, payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The notes have no sinking fund requirement, but may be redeemed, in whole or part, at our option. These notes do not contain any material debt covenants or cross default provisions. If there is a change in control of the company, and if as a consequence, the notes are rated below investment grade by both Moody Investors Service and Standard & Poor s, then holders of the notes may require us to repurchase them, in whole or in part, for 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Debt issuance costs are deferred and included in long-term debt and are amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the notes. Including debt issuance cost amortization, these notes have an effective annualized interest rate of 2.92%. 4.45% notes due December 2023 - In December 2013, we issued 10 year notes having an aggregate principal amount of $300 million. The notes are unsecured, senior obligations that mature on December 15, 2023 and bear interest at 4.45% per annum, payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The notes have no sinking fund requirement, but may be redeemed, in whole or part, at our option. These notes do not contain any material debt covenants or cross default provisions. If there is a change in control of the company, and if as a consequence, the notes are rated below investment grade by both Moody Investors Service and Standard & Poor s, then holders of the notes may require us to repurchase them, in whole or in part, for 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Debt issuance costs are deferred and included in long-term debt and are amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the notes. Including debt issuance cost amortization, these notes have an effective annualized interest rate of 4.56%. 6.55% notes due November 2036 - In November 2006, we issued 30 year notes having an aggregate principal amount of $200 million. The notes are unsecured, senior obligations of the Company that mature on November 15, 2036 and bear interest at 6.55% per annum, payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The notes have no sinking fund requirement, but may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option. These notes do not contain any material debt covenants or cross default provisions. If there is a change in control of the company, and if as a consequence, the notes are rated below investment grade by both Moody Investors Service and Standard & Poor s, then holders of the notes may require us to repurchase them, in whole or in part, for 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Debt issuance costs are deferred and included in long-term debt and are amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the notes. Including debt issuance cost amortization; these notes have an effective annualized interest rate of 6.67%. Commercial paper program - On March 2, 2015, we entered into the CP Program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes (the Notes ) pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Amounts available under the CP Program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time, with the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding under the CP Program at any time not to exceed $500 million. The Notes will have maturities of up to 397 days from date of issue. The Notes will rank at least pari passu with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, we had no amounts outstanding under the Notes. The net proceeds of the issuances of the Notes can be used to repay amounts under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. Revolving Credit Facility - In May 2012, we entered into a five year, $300 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as subsequently amended in March 2013 and increased to $500 million (the Facility )). The Facility allows us to borrow, repay, or to the extent permitted by the agreement, prepay and re-borrow funds at any time prior to the stated maturity date. The loan proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes including financing for acquisitions. Interest is based on, at our option, (1) a LIBOR-based formula that is dependent in part on our credit rating (LIBOR plus 105 basis points as of the date of this Page 28 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS report; up to a maximum of LIBOR plus 147.5 basis points), or (2) the greatest of (i) the JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points, or (iii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points, plus a spread dependent on our credit rating (5 basis points as of the date of this report; up to a maximum of 47.5 basis points). The Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including a total debt to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 65%, the absence of a material adverse effect and limitations on us and our subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness, liens, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, sales of all or substantially all assets, transactions with affiliates and hedging arrangements. The Facility also provides for customary events of default, including failure to pay principal, interest or fees when due, failure to comply with covenants, the fact that any representation or warranty made by us is false in any material respect, default under certain other indebtedness, certain insolvency or receivership events affecting us and our subsidiaries, certain ERISA events, material judgments and a change in control of the company. In May 2015, we entered into an amendment ("Amendment No. 2") to the Facility. Amendment No. 2, among other things, (i) extends the maturity date under the Facility to May 2020 and (ii) amends the applicable fee and margins on the revolving loans made pursuant to the Facility. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Facility as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, our total debt to total capitalization ratio was 40% , computed as follows: (in millions) December 31, 2016 Long-term debt $ 745.3 Total indebtedness 745.3 Total shareholders equity $ 1,133.8 Capitalization $ 1,879.1 Total indebtedness to capitalization 40 % All outstanding senior, unsecured notes were issued under an indenture dated as of April 1, 1991. The indenture contains certain limitations on liens and sale and lease-back transactions. As of December 31, 2016, we had open standby letters of credit of $24 million issued pursuant to a $48 million uncommitted Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement, and certain other credit lines. Credit Ratings As of December 31, 2016 , our senior unsecured debt was rated BBB by Standard & Poor with a Stable outlook and Baa2 with a Stable outlook by Moody Investors Service. We believe that these ratings afford us adequate access to the public and private debt markets. Contractual Obligations Under various agreements, we are obligated to make future cash payments in fixed amounts. These include payments under our long-term debt agreements and rent payments required under operating lease agreements. The following table summarizes our fixed cash obligations as of December 31, 2016 : Payment due by Period (in millions) Total 2017 2018 -2019 2020 -2021 2022 and after Long-term debt (1) $ 750.0 $ $ 250.0 $ $ 500.0 Fixed interest payments 369.2 33.3 59.8 52.9 223.2 Operating lease payments 63.5 17.0 21.9 9.7 14.9 Purchase obligations 68.2 62.2 5.0 0.6 0.4 Pension benefits (2) 468.2 39.6 83.3 90.3 255.0 Other long-term liabilities reflected on Consolidated Balance Sheets (3) Total $ 1,719.1 $ 152.1 $ 420.0 $ 153.5 $ 993.5 (1) Excludes original issue discount. (2) Pension benefits are funded by the respective pension trusts. The postretirement benefit component of the obligation is approximately $1 million per year for which there is no trust and will be directly funded by us. Pension benefits are included through 2026. (3) As the timing of future cash outflows is uncertain, the following long-term liabilities (and related balances) are excluded from the above table: Long-term asbestos liability ($625 million), long-term environmental liability ($49 million) and gross unrecognized tax benefits ($47 million) and related gross interest and penalties ($6 million). Page 29 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Capital Structure The following table sets forth our capitalization: (in millions, except %) December 31, 2016 2015 Short-term borrowings $ $ 49.6 Long-term debt 745.3 749.3 Total debt 745.3 798.9 Less cash and cash equivalents 509.7 363.5 Net debt * 235.6 435.4 Equity 1,145.7 1,150.8 Net capitalization* $ 1,381.3 $ 1,586.2 Net debt to equity* 20.6 % 37.8 % Net debt to net capitalization* 17.1 % 27.4 % * Net debt, a non-GAAP measure, represents total debt less cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2016, our non-U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $464 million of cash, which would be subject to additional tax upon repatriation to the United States. We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures, which include the presentation of net debt, provide useful information about our ability to satisfy our debt obligation with currently available funds. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, planning and compensation decisions and in evaluating our performance. Non-GAAP financial measures, which may be inconsistent with similarly captioned measures presented by other companies, should be viewed in the context of the definitions of the elements of such measures we provide and in addition to, and not as a substitute for, our reported results prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In 2016, equity decreased $5 million as a result of changes in currency translation adjustment of $64.7 million and cash dividends of $77.2 million , partially offset by net income attributable to common shareholders of $122.8 million , as well as changes in stock option exercises of $30.4 million , restricted stock, net of $11.5 million , and stock option amortization of $6.3 million . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements, nor do we have any interests in or relationships with any special purpose off-balance sheet financing entities. Page 30 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OUTLOOK Overall Our sales depend heavily on industries that are cyclical in nature or are subject to market conditions which may cause customer demand for our products to be volatile and unpredictable. Demand in these industries is affected by fluctuations in domestic and international economic conditions, as well as currency fluctuations, commodity costs, and a variety of other factors. For 2017, we expect a total year-over-year sales decline of approximately 2%, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange of 3% and the completion of a transition services agreement related to a divested product line of 0.5%, partially offset by core sales growth of approximately 1%. We expect a substantial improvement in operating profit and operating margins, driven by the absence of an asbestos provision, improved productivity, higher core sales volume, favorable product mix, and a reduction in engineering expense in our Aerospace & Electronics segment. Fluid Handling In 2017, we expect Fluid Handling sales to decline in the mid single-digit range compared to 2016, driven by a low single-digit core sales decline and unfavorable foreign currency translation. We expect Process Valves and Related Products sales to decline in the mid to high single-digit range compared to 2016, driven by a low single-digit core sales decline and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Excluding foreign exchange, we expect order rates in 2017 to be relatively flat compared to 2016 as our end markets continue to stabilize. However, given weak order activity in 2016, the backlog entering 2017 is lower than it was at the beginning of the prior year, driving core sales lower. We expect Commercial Valves sales to decline in the mid single-digit range compared to 2016, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, with core sales approximately flat, reflecting relative stability in our end markets. Our Other Products sales are expected to be relatively flat compared to 2016, with modest growth in the U.S. municipal market. For the segment, we expect a decline in operating profit compared to 2016, as the negative impact from lower core sales and unfavorable foreign currency will be partially offset by productivity initiatives resulting in relatively flat operating margins compared to 2016. Payment & Merchandising Technologies We expect Payment & Merchandising Technologies sales to increase in the mid single-digit range compared to 2016, with a low double-digit improvement in core sales, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. We expect core sales to improve across both CPI and Merchandising Systems, with a higher core growth rate at CPI. At CPI, we expect core sales improvement to be driven by several vertical end markets, including transportation, vending, financial services, and gaming, although the most significant growth is expected from the retail vertical. At Merchandising Systems, we expect an improvement in core sales driven primarily by better demand from large bottler customers and full-line operators. We expect the segment operating profit to increase substantially compared to 2016, driven by the higher sales and productivity, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and unfavorable foreign currency. Aerospace & Electronics We expect Aerospace & Electronics core sales to decrease in the mid single-digit range compared to 2016. For 2017, we expect that commercial market conditions will remain generally positive, and we expect sales growth from our commercial OEM business. However, military OE sales are expected to decline substantially given the completion of a large military program in 2016 that will not repeat in 2017. We also expect aftermarket sales to decline, primarily as a result of lower modernization and upgrade sales. Despite the reduction in sales, we expect segment operating profit in 2017 to increase compared to 2016 driven by favorable product mix associated with the completion of the large military program, strong productivity and lower engineering expense. Engineered Materials In 2017, we expect the Engineered Materials segment sales will increase slightly compared to the prior year. We expect modest growth in sales to our building product customers, partially offset by a decline in sales to RV manufacturers. Segment operating profit is expected to be relatively flat compared to 2016. Page 31 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary. The accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and, therefore, are critical to understanding our results of operations. We have discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded when title (risk of loss) passes to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue on long-term, fixed-price contracts is recorded on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. Sales under cost-reimbursement-type contracts are recorded as costs are incurred. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. This new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate all current industry-specific guidance. The new revenue recognition standard provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB agreed to a one-year deferral of the effective date; the new standard is now effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption of the new revenue standard is permitted; however, entities reporting under U.S. GAAP are not permitted to adopt the standard earlier than the original effective date, which was for years beginning after December 15, 2016. The new standard can be applied either retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of initial application. We developed a project plan and established a cross-functional implementation team consisting of representatives from across all of our business segments. The project plan includes analyzing the impact of the standard on our contract portfolio by reviewing our current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the new standard to our revenue contracts. We have made significant progress on our contract reviews and continue to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, related disclosures and transition method. While we anticipate potentially increased over time revenue recognition for certain revenue contracts, we do not believe the standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We expect to adopt the standard as of January 1, 2018. Inventories. Inventories include the costs of material, labor and overhead and are stated at the lower of cost or market. We regularly review inventory values on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory primarily based on historical performance and our forecast of product demand over the next two years. The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $54.1 million and $48.5 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 740 Income Taxes ( ASC 740 ), which requires an asset and liability approach for the financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. These balances are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year(s) in which these temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred income taxes is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Based on consideration of all available evidence regarding their utilization, we record net deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized. Where, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance for the amount that, in our judgment, is sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The evidence we consider in reaching such conclusions includes, but is not limited to; (1) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, (2) future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences, (3) taxable income in prior carryback year(s) if carryback is permitted under the tax law, (4) cumulative losses in recent years, (5) a history of tax losses or credit carryforwards expiring unused, (6) a carryback or carryforward period that is so brief it limits realization of tax benefits, and (7) a strong earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the carryforward and support showing that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition. Page 32 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We account for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with ASC 740, which prescribes a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based solely on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line of the Consolidated Statement of Operations, while accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In determining whether the earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are permanently reinvested overseas, we consider the following: Our history of utilizing non-U.S. cash to acquire non-U.S. businesses, Our current and future needs for cash outside the U.S. (e.g., to fund capital expenditures, business operations, potential acquisitions, etc.), Our ability to satisfy U.S.-based cash needs (e.g., domestic pension contributions, interest payment on external debt, dividends to shareholders, etc.) with cash generated by our U.S. businesses, and The effect U.S. tax reform proposals calling for reduced corporate income tax rates and/or repatriation tax holidays would have on the amount of the tax liability. Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets. As of December 31, 2016 , we had $1.149 billion of goodwill. Our business acquisitions typically result in the generation of goodwill and other intangible assets. We follow the provisions under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350 ) as it relates to the accounting for goodwill in our consolidated financial statements. These provisions require that we, on at least an annual basis, evaluate the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned and attributed and compare that fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists. Impairment testing takes place more often than annually if events or circumstances indicate a change in the impairment status. A reporting unit is an operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment (a component ), in which case the component would be the reporting unit. As of December 31, 2016 , we had seven reporting units. When performing our annual impairment assessment, we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying value. Goodwill is considered to be potentially impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair values are established primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows at an estimated cost of capital which varies for each reporting unit and which, as of our most recent annual impairment assessment, ranged between 9.0% and 12.0% (a weighted average of 10.5% ), reflecting the respective inherent business risk of each of the reporting units tested. This methodology for valuing our reporting units (commonly referred to as the Income Method) has not changed from the prior year. The determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts, which change from year to year. The revenue growth rates included in the forecasts represent our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions, and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost increases/reductions. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions, including changes in market conditions, and management judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. In addition to the foregoing, for each reporting unit, market multiples are used to corroborate our discounted cash flow results where fair value is estimated based on earnings before income taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") and revenue multiples determined by available public information of comparable businesses. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If actual results are not consistent with management estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical, reasonably possible 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. The effects of this hypothetical 10% decrease would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our carrying value for each of our reporting units. No impairment charges have been required during 2016, 2015 or 2014. As of December 31, 2016 , we had $282 million of net intangible assets, of which $27 million were intangibles with indefinite useful lives, consisting of trade names. Intangibles with indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the potential for impairment. If the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Fair value is calculated using relief of royalty method. We amortize the cost of definite-lived intangibles over their estimated useful lives. Page 33 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In addition to annual testing for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, we review all of our definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Examples of events or changes in circumstances could include, but are not limited to, a prolonged economic downturn, current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of an asset or asset group, or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Recoverability is based upon projections of anticipated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposal of the definite-lived intangible asset (or asset group), as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. Reviews occur at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows associated with other long-lived assets or asset groups and include estimated future revenues, gross profit margins, operating profit margins and capital expenditures which are based on the businesses strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts, which change from year to year. The revenue growth rates included in the forecasts represent our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions, and the profit margin assumptions are based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost increases/reductions. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions, including changes in market conditions, and management judgment in applying them to the analysis. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then the definite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired and a charge would be taken against net earnings based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated recoverable amount. Judgments that we make which impact these assessments relate to the expected useful lives of definite-lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets, and are affected primarily by changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in technology or development of alternative assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows. Since judgment is involved in determining the recoverable amount of definite-lived intangible assets, there is risk that the carrying value of our definite-lived intangible assets may require adjustment in future periods. Historical results to date have generally approximated expected cash flows for the identifiable cash flow generating level. We believe there have been no events or circumstances which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our indefinite-lived or definite-lived intangible assets below their carrying value. Contingencies. The categories of claims for which we have estimated our liability, the amount of our liability accruals, and the estimates of our related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings and other contingencies. Please refer to Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Asbestos Liability and Related Insurance Coverage and Receivable. We have retained the firm of Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Associates, Inc. ( HR&A ), a nationally recognized expert in the field, to assist management in estimating our asbestos liability in the tort system. HR&A reviews information provided by us concerning claims filed, settled and dismissed, amounts paid in settlements and relevant claim information such as the nature of the asbestos-related disease asserted by the claimant, the jurisdiction where filed and the time lag from filing to disposition of the claim. The methodology used by HR&A to project future asbestos costs is based on our recent historical experience for claims filed, settled and dismissed during a base reference period. Our experience is then compared to estimates of the number of individuals likely to develop asbestos-related diseases determined based on widely used previously conducted epidemiological studies augmented with current data inputs. Those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population of workers believed to have been exposed to asbestos. Using that information, HR&A estimates the number of future claims that would be filed against us and estimates the aggregate settlement or indemnity costs that would be incurred to resolve both pending and future claims based upon the average settlement costs by disease during the reference period. Our liability estimate is augmented for the costs of defending asbestos claims in the tort system using a forecast from us which is based upon discussions with its defense counsel. Based on this information, HR&A compiles an estimate of our asbestos liability for pending and future claims using a range of reference periods based on claim experience and covering claims expected to be filed through the indicated forecast period. The most significant factors affecting the liability estimate are (1) the number of new mesothelioma claims filed against us, (2) the average settlement costs for mesothelioma claims, (3) the percentage of mesothelioma claims dismissed against us and (4) the aggregate defense costs incurred by us. These factors are interdependent, and no one factor predominates in determining the liability estimate. These trend factors have both positive and negative effects on the dynamics of asbestos litigation in the tort system and the related best estimate of our asbestos liability, and these effects do not move in a linear fashion but rather change over multi-year periods. In our view, the forecast period used to provide the best estimate for asbestos claims and related liabilities and costs is a judgment based upon a number of trend factors, including the number and type of claims being filed each year; the jurisdictions where such claims are filed, and the effect of any legislation or judicial orders in such jurisdictions restricting the types of claims that can proceed to trial on the merits; and the likelihood of any comprehensive asbestos legislation at the federal level. Accordingly, we continue to monitor these trend factors over time and periodically assesses whether an alternative forecast period is appropriate. With the assistance of HR&A, effective as of December 31, 2016, we extended our estimate of the asbestos liability, including the costs of settlement or indemnity payments and defense costs relating to currently pending claims and future claims Page 34 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS projected to be filed against us through the generally accepted end point of such claims in 2059. Our previous estimate was for asbestos claims filed or projected to be filed through 2021. Our estimate of the asbestos liability for pending and future claims through 2059 is based on the projected future asbestos costs resulting from our experience using a range of reference periods for claims filed, settled and dismissed. Based on this estimate, we recorded an additional liability of $227 million (an aggregate asbestos liability of $696 million) as of December 31, 2016. Estimation of our exposure for asbestos-related claims is subject to significant uncertainties, as there are multiple variables that can affect the timing, severity and quantity of claims and the manner of their resolution. In conjunction with developing the aggregate liability estimate referenced above, we also developed an estimate of probable insurance recoveries for our asbestos liabilities. As of December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate asbestos insurance receivable of $143 million. In developing this estimate, we considered our coverage-in-place and other settlement agreements, as well as a number of additional factors. These additional factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies, the method by which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies and the years covered by those policies, how settlement and defense costs will be covered by the insurance policies and interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships. Environmental. For environmental matters, we record a liability for estimated remediation costs when it is probable that we will be responsible for such costs and they can be reasonably estimated. Generally, third party specialists assist in the estimation of remediation costs. The environmental remediation liability as of December 31, 2016 is substantially all for the Goodyear Site. Estimates of our environmental liabilities at the Goodyear Site are based on currently available facts, present laws and regulations and current technology available for remediation, and are recorded on an undiscounted basis. These estimates consider our prior experience in the Goodyear Site investigation and remediation, as well as available data from, and in consultation with, our environmental specialists. Estimates at the Goodyear Site are subject to significant uncertainties caused primarily by the dynamic nature of the Goodyear Site conditions, the range of remediation alternatives available, together with the corresponding estimates of cleanup methodology and costs, as well as ongoing, required regulatory approvals, primarily from the EPA. During the third quarter of 2014, the EPA issued a Record of Decision amendment requiring, among other things, additional source area remediation resulting in us recording a charge of $49.0 million, extending the accrued costs through 2022. As of December 31, 2016, the total estimated gross liability for the Goodyear Site was $49 million. On July 31, 2006, we entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy pursuant to which, among other things, the U.S. Government reimburses us for 21% of qualifying costs of investigation and remediation activities at the Goodyear Site. Pension Plans. In the United States, we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that covers approximately 18% of all U.S. employees. The benefits are based on years of service and compensation on a final average pay basis, except for certain hourly employees where benefits are fixed per year of service. This plan is funded with a trustee in respect to past and current service. Charges to expense are based upon costs computed by an independent actuary. Contributions are intended to provide for future benefits earned to date. A number of our non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover approximately 11% of all non-U.S. employees. The benefits are typically based upon years of service and compensation. These plans are generally funded with trustees in respect to past and current service. The expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost is determined by applying the assumed expected return on plan assets to the fair value of plan assets. For one of the U.K. pension plans, a market-related value of assets is used in lieu of the fair value of plan assets for this purpose. The net actuarial loss (gain) is amortized to the extent that it exceeds 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. The amortization period is the average life expectancy of plan participants for most plans. The amortization period for plans with a significant number of active participants accruing benefits is the average future working lifetime of plan participants. The prior service cost (credit) is amortized over the average future working lifetime of plan participants whose prior service benefits were changed. The net periodic pension benefit was $9 million , $11 million and $12 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The net periodic pension benefit was $2 million less in 2016 compared to 2015, driven by lower discount rates for both U.S. and non U.S. plans. Employer cash contributions were $8 million, $17 million and $24 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan. We expect, based on current actuarial calculations, to contribute cash of approximately $12 million to our pension plans in 2017. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of plan assets. Holding all other factors constant, a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return of plan assets by 0.25 percentage points would have increased 2016 pension expense by $1.0 million for U.S. pension plans and $1.0 million for non-U.S. pension plans. Also, holding all other factors constant, a decrease in the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension cost by 0.25 percentage points would have increased 2016 pension expense by $0.1 million for U.S. pension plans and $0.5 million for non-U.S. pension plans. Page 35 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following key assumptions were used to calculate the benefit obligation and net periodic cost for the periods indicated: Pension Benefits 2016 2015 2014 Benefit Obligations U.S. Plans: Discount rate 4.29 % 4.41 % 4.10 % Rate of compensation increase N/A N/A N/A Non-U.S. Plans: Discount rate 2.29 % 3.30 % 3.01 % Rate of compensation increase 2.85 % 2.81 % 2.40 % Net Periodic Benefit Cost U.S. Plans: Discount rate 4.41 % 4.10 % 4.90 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 7.75 % 7.75 % 7.75 % Rate of compensation increase N/A N/A N/A Non-U.S. Plans: Discount rate 3.30 % 3.01 % 4.05 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 6.77 % 6.94 % 7.01 % Rate of compensation increase 2.81 % 2.40 % 2.56 % The long-term expected rate of return on plan assets assumptions were determined with input from independent investment consultants and plan actuaries, utilizing asset pricing models and considering historic returns. The discount rates we used for valuing pension liabilities are based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligation.
