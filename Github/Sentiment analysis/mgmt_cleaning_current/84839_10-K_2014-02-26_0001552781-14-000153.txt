In 2013 the Company revenue grew 5.2%, with growth in all lines of service. The Company revenue from bed bug service offering grew over 20% for the year and HomeTeam TAEXX homebuilder installations rose almost 36%. We have also expanded Orkin international franchise portfolio to a total of 26 international franchises in 9 regions. Further in February 2014 we expanded our international footprint by acquiring Allpest WA located in Perth, Australia. Management is pleased with the 2013 accomplishments and recognizes many opportunities to improve our business in the future. We feel we have a premium brand in Orkin that is recognized around the world, as well as other brands that are well known in their respective markets. We will continue to look for better ways to do what we do in providing our customers with premiere service that addresses their pest control needs. Results of Operations 2013 Versus 2012 Overview The Company gross margin increased to 49.3% for 2013 from 49.0% in 2012. Sales, general and administrative expense decreased in 2013 to 32.0% of revenue versus 32.1% in 2012. The Company remained flat in its depreciation and amortization margin in 2013 at 3.0% in 2013 and 2012. The Company had net income of $123.3 million in 2013 compared to $111.3 million in 2012, a 10.8% increase. Net profit margin improved to 9.2% in 2013 from 8.8% in 2012. Revenues Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $1.337 billion, an increase of $66.4 million or 5.2% from 2012 revenues of $1.271 billion. Commercial pest control represented approximately 41% of the Company business in 2013 and grew 4.9% in 2013 due to increases in sales and bed bug revenues. Residential pest control represented approximately 41% of the Company business and increased 6.1% driven by increased leads, closure and pricing as well as increased capture of TAEXX homebuilder installations and bed bug revenues. The Company termite business, which represented approximately 17% of the Company revenue, grew 4.5% in 2013 due to increases in ancillary service sales as well as the Company expanded sales force and price improvement. 15 The Company implemented its traditional price increase program in June 2013 which had a positive impact on the year revenue. Less than 2.0% of the Company revenue increase came from pricing actions. Nearly 80% of the Company revenue was recurring in 2013 and 2012. The Company foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. The Company established new franchises in Guam, Iraq, Trinidad and Tobago and St. Lucia in 2013 for a total of 26 international franchises at December 31, 2013 with 22 at December 31, 2012. Orkin had 80 and 79 total domestic and international franchises at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Cost of Services Provided For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 cost of services provided increased $30.9 million or 4.8%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2012. Gross margin for the year was 49.3% for 2013 and 49.0% for 2012. While most costs increased during the year due to the Company early 2013 and late 2012 acquisitions, service salaries, personnel related costs and materials and supplies increased due to increased sales, increased TAEXX installations and higher group medical insurance premiums. These costs were partially offset by lower insurance and claims costs. Depreciation and Amortization For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, depreciation and amortization increased $0.9 million, or 2.4% compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2012. The increase is due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in late 2012 and early 2013 partially offset by several fixed and intangible assets being fully depreciated or amortized. Sales, General and Administrative For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $20.8 million, or 5.1% compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 representing 32.0% of revenues compared to 32.1% of revenues in the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A decreased due to reduced salaries as a percentage of revenues as the Company continues to maximize efficiency in its workforce and bad debt expense as the Company continues its focus on collections. The reductions as a percentage of SG&A are partially offset by increases in professional services due to timing of various information technology projects and higher advertising expenses due to the Company new ad campaigns. Interest (Income)/Expense, Net Interest (income)/expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $0.4 million income, an increase of $0.4 million compared to $14 thousand expense in 2012. Interest income for the year is due to interest received on cash balances in the Company various cash accounts. (Gain)/loss on Sales/Impairment of assets, Net (Gain)/loss on sales/impairment of assets, net decreased to $0.2 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $0.5 million gain in 2012. The Company recognized gains from the sale of owned vehicles and property in 2013 and 2012. Taxes The Company effective tax rate was 35.6% in 2013 compared to 37.0% in 2012, due primarily to differences in state tax rates and foreign income taxes and the release of certain deferred tax liabilities. Results of Operations 2012 Versus 2011 Overview The Company gross margin increased slightly to 49.0% for 2012 from 48.8% in 2011. Sales, general and administrative expense decreased in 2012 to 32.1% of revenue versus 32.3% in 2011. The Company experienced a reduction in its depreciation and amortization margin to 3.0% in 2012 versus 3.1% in 2011 due to several assets being fully depreciated, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets acquired in 2011. The Company had net income of $111.3 million compared to $100.7 million in 2011, a 10.5% increase. Net profit margin improved to 8.8% in 2012 from 8.4% in 2011. Revenues Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $1.3 billion, an increase of $65.8 million or 5.5% from 2011 revenues of $1.2 billion. Commercial pest control represented approximately 41.0% of the Company business in 2012 and grew 3.7% in 2012 due to increases in sales, bed bug revenues and revenues from 2011 acquisitions. Residential pest control represented approximately 41.0% of the Company business and increased 8.0% driven by increased leads, closure and pricing. The Company termite business, which represented approximately 18.0% of the Company revenue, grew 4.0% in 2012 due to increases in ancillary services sales as well as the Company expanded sales force and price increases. 16 The Company foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. The Company established new franchises in Mexico, China, Turks and Caicos Islands and Chile for a total of 22 and 18 international franchises at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Orkin had 79 and 76 total domestic and international franchises at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Cost of Services Provided For the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 cost of services provided increased $30.8 million or 5.0%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2011. Gross margin for the year was 49.0% for 2012 and 48.8% for 2011. While all costs increased during the year due to the Company early 2012 and late 2011 acquisitions, insurance and claims expense increased but was partially offset by lower termite provision claims and telephone costs were down marginally due to cost controls, partially offset by higher personnel related costs including payroll taxes and group premiums. Depreciation and Amortization For the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, depreciation and amortization increased $1.2 million, or 3.1% compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2011. The increase is due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in late 2011 and early 2012 partially offset by several intangible assets being fully amortized. Sales, General and Administrative For the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $18.8 million, or 4.8% compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 representing 32.1% of revenues compared to 32.3% of revenues in the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A decreased due to reductions in professional services due to timing of projects and reduced salaries as a percentage of revenues as the Company continues to maximize efficiency in its workforce. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $14 thousand, a decrease of $0.5 million compared to $0.5 million in 2011 due to the pay-off of the remainder of the Company outstanding borrowings in 2011. Pension Settlement Management terminated its wholly-owned subsidiary (Waltham Services, LLC) salaried pension plan and recorded a settlement loss, which resulted in an additional expense of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. (Gain)/loss on Sales/Impairment of assets, Net (Gain)/Loss on Sales/Impairment of assets, net increased to $0.5 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $0.4 million loss in 2011. The Company recognized gains from the sale of owned vehicles and property in Canada in 2012 while recognizing impairment on software related to terminated projects for approximately $0.5 million in 2011. Taxes The Company effective tax rate was 37.0% in 2012 compared to 37.5% in 2011, due primarily to differences in state tax rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and Cash Flow The Company cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 were $118.2 million, $65.1 million and $46.3 million, respectively. The following table sets forth the historical cash flows for the years ended December 31: (in thousands) 2013 2012 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 162,665 $ 141,919 $ 154,647 Net cash used in investing activities (30,790 ) (42,693 ) (29,154 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (75,653 ) (80,989 ) (99,427 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3,088 ) 570 (704 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 53,134 $ 18,807 $ 25,362 17 Cash Provided by Operating Activities The Company operations generated cash of $162.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily from net income of $123.3 million, compared with cash provided by operating activities of $141.9 million in 2012 and $154.6 million in 2011. The Company believes its current cash and cash equivalents balances, future cash flows expected to be generated from operating activities and available borrowings under its $175.0 million credit facility will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations, and fund expansion of the business for the foreseeable future. The Company made contributions totaling $5.0 million to the Rollins, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries defined benefit retirement plans (the Plans ) during the year ended December 31, 2013 and $5.2 million and $4.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, as a result of the Plans funding status. The Company is considering making contributions to its Plans of approximately $3.3 million during fiscal 2014. In the opinion of management, additional Plan contributions will not have a material effect on the Company financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Cash Used in Investing Activities The Company used $30.8 million on investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $42.7 million and $29.2 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively, and of that, invested approximately $18.6 million in capital expenditures during 2013 compared to $19.0 million and $18.7 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively. Capital expenditures for the year consisted primarily of property purchases, equipment replacements and technology related projects. The Company expects to invest between $15.0 million and $20.0 million in 2014 in capital expenditures. During 2013, the Company subsidiaries acquired several small companies totaling $12.6 million compared to $25.0 million in acquisitions during 2012 and $11.4 million in 2011. The expenditures for the Company acquisitions were funded with cash on hand. The Company continues to seek new acquisitions. Cash Provided by Financing Activities The Company used cash of $75.7 million on financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $81.0 million and $99.4 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively. A total of $65.7 million was paid in cash dividends ($0.45 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2013 including a special dividend paid in December 2013 of $0.09 per share, compared to $64.3 million ($0.44 per share) during the year ended December 31, 2012 including a special dividend paid in December 2012 of $0.12 per share and $41.1 million ($0.28 per share) in 2011. The Company used $8.4 million to repurchase on the open market 0.3 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $24.56 per share during 2013 compared to $16.4 million to purchase 0.8 million shares at an average price of $20.93 in 2012 and $27.2 million to purchase 1.5 million shares at a weighted average price of $18.68 in 2011. There remains 5.0 million shares authorized to be repurchased under prior Board approval. In addition to the shares purchased on the open market, the Company repurchased $5.3 million, $3.5 million and $3.0 million of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, from employees for the payment of taxes on vesting restricted shares. The Company $118.2 million of total cash at December 31, 2013, is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. Approximately $51.0 million is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $67.2 million is primarily held in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic banks. The Company international business is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. Repatriation of cash from the Company foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the Company current business plan. The Company maintains a large cash position in the United States while having little third-party debt to service. Rollins maintains adequate liquidity and capital resources, without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic operations and obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic business for the foreseeable future. 18 On October 31, 2012, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank and Bank of America, N.A. for an unsecured line of credit of up to $175.0 million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and a $25.0 million swingline subfacility. As of December 31, 2013, no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit or under the swingline subfacility. The Company maintains approximately $30.1 million in letters of credit. These letters of credit are required by the Company fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the Company self-insured status, to secure various workers compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage. The Company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims. The Revolving Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain of Rollins domestic-subsidiaries. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is October 31, 2017, subject to optional annual extensions on the next two anniversaries of the Credit Agreement for one year each. Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at one of the following two rates, at the Company election: the Base Rate, which shall mean the highest of (i) the per annum rate which the Administrative Agent publicly announces from time to time as its prime lending rate, (ii) the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.50% per annum, and (iii) the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (which equals LIBOR as increased to account for the maximum reserve percentages established by the U.S. Federal Reserve) determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one (1) month, plus 1.0% per annum. with respect to any Eurodollar borrowings, the Adjusted LIBOR Rate plus an additional amount, which varies between .75% and 1.00%, based upon Rollins then-current debt-to-EBITDA ratio. As of December 31, 2013, the additional rate allocated was .75%. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, certain financial covenants including covenants restricting the Company ability to incur certain indebtedness or liens, or to merge or consolidate with or sell substantially all of its assets to another entity. Further, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains financial covenants restricting the Company ability to permit the ratio of the Company consolidated debt to EBITDA to exceed certain limits. The Company remained in compliance with applicable debt covenants at December 31, 2013 and expects to maintain compliance throughout 2014. Litigation For discussion on the Company legal contingencies, see note 12 to the accompanying financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Other than the operating leases disclosed in the table that follows, the Company has no material off balance sheet arrangements. The impact that the Company contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows: Payments due by period Contractual obligations (in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 - 3 years 4 - 5 years More than 5 years Business combination related liabilities $ 6,496 $ 4,018 $ 2,291 $ 187 $ Non-cancelable operating leases 75,195 27,550 26,916 12,194 8,535 Unrecognized Tax Positions (1) 515 515 Total (2) $ 82,206 $ 31,568 $ 29,722 $ 12,381 $ 8,535 (1) These amounts represent expected payments with interest for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2013. (2) Minimum pension funding requirements are not included as funding will not be required. The Company is considering making contributions to its pension plans of approximately $3.3 million during 2014. 19 Critical Accounting Policies The Company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require management most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows: Accrual for Termite Contracts The Company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. Factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. It is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the Company business practices. However, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims. Accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company consolidated statements of financial position. Accrued Insurance The Company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers compensation and vehicle liability. The estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. The Company contracts an independent third party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the Company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. The actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. Management judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management knowledge and control. Additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. The Company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims. Initiatives that have been implemented include pre-employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, and pre-hire, random and post-accident drug testing. The Company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a Red Alert program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limited-duty basis. Revenue Recognition The Company revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed. For certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. Residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. In general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. For pest control customers, the Company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. The Company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. The Company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues. Termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. At the inception of a new baiting services contract, upon quality control review of the installation, the Company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. A portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element. This portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits. The allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price. There are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions. Baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits. At inception revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. For outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information. The performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. As the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues for noticed claims. The costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses. 20 All revenues are reported net of sales taxes. Contingency Accruals The Company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450 Contingencies, Management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. Estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. Because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. However, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company financial condition or results of operations. Contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the Company consolidated statements of financial position. Defined benefit pension plans In 2005, the Company ceased all future benefit accruals under the Rollins, Inc. defined benefit plan, although the Company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through June 2005. The Company terminated the Waltham Services, LLC Salaried Pension Plan and all benefits have been settled via an annuity purchase or lump sum in December 2012. The Company also includes the Waltham Services, LLC Hourly Employee Pension Plan to the Company financial statements. The Company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 715 Compensation- Retirement Benefits , and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary. The Company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes, the investments strategy, and the views of our investment adviser. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years. Therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains (losses) ultimately affects future pension expense. The Company assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 7% which is unchanged from the prior year. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company utilizes a yield curve approach. The approach utilizes an economic model whereby the Company expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecasted and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year. The economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds. The discount rate was 5.20% as of December 31, 2013 compared to 4.17% in 2012 and 5.01% in 2011. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation. As set forth in note 13 to the Company financial statements, included among the asset categories for the Plan investments are real estate, tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds. These investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. In accordance with ASU No. 2009-12 Investments In Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or Its Equivalent), these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. These valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds financial statements for reasonableness . As of December 31, 2013, the defined benefit plans were over-funded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders equity by $45.7 million before tax and $28.1 million after tax. 21 New Accounting Standards Recently adopted accounting standards In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (ASU 2012-02). This standard provides new accounting guidance that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. An entity would continue to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset if the asset fails the qualitative assessment, while no further analysis would be required if it passes. The provisions of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our 2013 fiscal year. Adoption of this new guidance did not have an impact on the 2013 impairment test results. Recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2014 In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2013-02) to Comprehensive Income. The guidance requires disclosure of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on the respective line items of net income. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2014; we do not expect the new guidance to have a material effect on our financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-04, Liabilities (Topic 405): Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements for Which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). This guidance requires an entity to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of this guidance is fixed at the reporting date. This stipulates that (1) it will include the amount the entity agreed to pay for the arrangement between them and the other entities that are also obligated to the liability and (2) any additional amount the entity expects to pay on behalf of the other entities. The objective of this update is to provide guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal periods (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2013. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company reported results of operations or financial position. In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05, Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830): Parent Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity. The objective of the amendments in this Update is to resolve the diversity in practice about whether Subtopic 810-10, Consolidation Overall, or Subtopic 830-30, Foreign Currency Matters Translation of Financial Statements, applies to the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business (other than a sale of in substance real estate or conveyance of oil and gas mineral rights) within a foreign entity. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2015; we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company reported results of operations or financial position. In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists. Topic 740, Income Taxes, does not include explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. There is diversity in practice in the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits in those instances. Some entities present unrecognized tax benefits as a liability unless the unrecognized tax benefit is directly associated with a tax position taken in a tax year that results in, or that resulted in, the recognition of a net operating loss or tax credit carryforward for that year and the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward has not been utilized. Other entities present unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss or tax credit carryforward in certain circumstances. The objective of the amendments in this Update is to eliminate that diversity in practice. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2014; we do not expect the new guidance to have a material effect on our financial statements. 22 Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements include statements regarding management belief that environmental remediation costs estimated to be incurred are not material to the Company financial condition or operating results; the outcome of litigation, as discussed in the Legal Proceedings section and elsewhere, and the Company belief that such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial condition, results of operations or liquidity; the Company expectation to continue its payment of cash dividends; the adequacy of the Company resources and borrowings to fund operations and obligations; management belief that any additional pension plan contributions will not have a material effect on the Company financial position, results of operation or liquidity; the Company projected 2014 capital expenditures; the plans to expand Orkin franchise program and to grow in foreign markets through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings and through acquisitions; the Company expectation to maintain compliance with the covenants contained in its Revolving Credit Agreement throughout 2014; the impact and amount of the Company contractual obligations; management expectations regarding termite claims and factors that impact future costs from those claims; the expected cost of termite renewals; the expected collectability of accounts receivable; expected tax consequences; the impact of recent accounting pronouncements; and interest rate risks and foreign exchange currency risk on the Company financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
