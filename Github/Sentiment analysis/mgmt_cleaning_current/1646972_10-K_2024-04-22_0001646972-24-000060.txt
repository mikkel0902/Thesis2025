In this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Albertsons Companies, Inc., the words "Albertsons," the "Company," "we," "us," "our" and "ours" refer to Albertsons Companies, Inc., together with its subsidiaries.

Fiscal 2023 highlights In summary, our financial and operating highlights for fiscal 2023 include: Identical sales increased 3.0% Digital sales increased 22% Loyalty members increased 16% to 39.8 million 38 Table of Contents Net income of $1,296 million, or $2.23 per Class A common share Adjusted net income of $1,694 million, or $2.88 per Class A common share Adjusted EBITDA of $4,318 million Operating cash flows of $2,660 million Continued modernization of our store fleet, including completing 150 remodels and opening six new stores Stores The following table shows stores operating, acquired, opened and closed during the periods presented: Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2021 Stores, beginning of period 2,271 2,276 2,277 Acquired 3 Opened 6 5 7 Closed (8) (10) (11) Stores, end of period 2,269 2,271 2,276 The following table summarizes our stores by size: Number of Stores Percent of Total Retail Square Feet (1) Square Footage February 24, 2024 February 25, 2023 February 24, 2024 February 25, 2023 February 24, 2024 February 25, 2023 Less than 30,000 217 219 9.6 % 9.6 % 4.9 5.0 30,000 to 50,000 778 779 34.3 % 34.3 % 32.6 32.6 More than 50,000 1,274 1,273 56.1 % 56.1 % 75.3 75.2 Total Stores 2,269 2,271 100.0 % 100.0 % 112.8 112.8 (1) In millions, reflects total square footage of retail stores operating at the end of the period. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES We define EBITDA as generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") earnings (net loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings (net loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to eliminate the effects of items management does not consider in assessing our ongoing core performance. We define Adjusted net income as GAAP net income adjusted to eliminate the effects of items management does not consider in assessing our ongoing core performance. We define Adjusted net income per Class A common share as Adjusted net income divided by the weighted average diluted Class A common shares outstanding, as adjusted to reflect all restricted stock units and awards outstanding at the end of the period, as well as the conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock when it is antidilutive for GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per Class A common share (collectively, the "Non-GAAP Measures") are performance measures that provide supplemental information we believe is useful to analysts and investors to evaluate our ongoing results of operations, when considered alongside other GAAP measures such as net income, operating income, gross margin and net income per Class A common share. These Non-GAAP Measures exclude the financial impact of items management does not consider in assessing our ongoing core operating performance, and thereby provide useful measures to analysts and investors of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Other companies may have different definitions of Non-GAAP Measures and provide for different adjustments, and comparability to our results of operations may be impacted by such differences. We also use Adjusted EBITDA for board of director and bank compliance reporting. 39 Table of Contents Our presentation of Non-GAAP Measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Non-GAAP Measures only for supplemental purposes. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following information summarizes the components of our Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Summary of Consolidated Statements of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share data) : Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2021 Net sales and other revenue $ 79,237.7 100.0 % $ 77,649.7 100.0 % $ 71,887.0 100.0 % Cost of sales 57,192.0 72.2 55,894.1 72.0 51,164.6 71.2 Gross margin 22,045.7 27.8 21,755.6 28.0 20,722.4 28.8 Selling and administrative expenses 19,932.9 25.2 19,596.0 25.2 18,300.5 25.5 Loss (gain) on property dispositions and impairment losses, net 43.9 (147.5) (0.2) (15.0) Operating income 2,068.9 2.6 2,307.1 3.0 2,436.9 3.3 Interest expense, net 492.1 0.6 404.6 0.5 481.9 0.7 Loss on debt extinguishment 3.7 Other income, net (12.2) (33.0) (148.2) (0.2) Income before income taxes 1,589.0 2.0 1,935.5 2.5 2,099.5 2.8 Income tax expense 293.0 0.4 422.0 0.5 479.9 0.7 Net income $ 1,296.0 1.6 % $ 1,513.5 2.0 % $ 1,619.6 2.1 % Basic net income per Class A common share $ 2.25 $ 2.29 $ 2.73 Diluted net income per Class A common share 2.23 2.27 2.70 Net Sales and Other Revenue Net sales and other revenue increased $1,588.0 million, or 2.0%, to $79,237.7 million in fiscal 2023 from $77,649.7 million in fiscal 2022. The increase in Net sales and other revenue in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by our 3.0% increase in identical sales, with growth in pharmacy sales and increasing digital sales being the primary contributors to the identical sales increase. The increase in Net sales and other revenue was partially offset by lower fuel sales. The components of the change in Net sales and other revenue for fiscal 2023 were as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2023 Net sales and other revenue for fiscal 2022 $ 77,649.7 Identical sales increase of 3.0% 2,164.6 Decrease in fuel sales (460.9) Decrease in sales due to store closures, net of new store openings (1.2) Other, net (114.5) Net sales and other revenue for fiscal 2023 $ 79,237.7 40 Table of Contents Identical Sales, Excluding Fuel Identical sales include stores operating during the same period in both the current year and the prior year, comparing sales on a daily basis. Direct to consumer digital sales are included in identical sales, and fuel sales are excluded from identical sales. Acquired stores become identical on the one-year anniversary date of the acquisition. Identical sales results, on an actual basis, for the past three fiscal years were as follows: Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2021 Identical sales, excluding fuel 3.0% 6.9% (0.1)% The following table represents Net sales and other revenue by product type (dollars in millions): Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022 Amount (1) % of Total Amount (1) % of Total Non-perishables (2) $ 39,977.3 50.5 % $ 39,142.4 50.4 % Fresh (3) 25,442.7 32.1 % 25,585.4 32.9 % Pharmacy 8,240.0 10.4 % 6,769.3 8.7 % Fuel 4,396.7 5.5 % 4,857.6 6.3 % Other (4) 1,181.0 1.5 % 1,295.0 1.7 % Total $ 79,237.7 100.0 % $ 77,649.7 100.0 % (1) Digital related sales are included in the categories to which the revenue pertains. (2) Consists primarily of general merchandise, grocery, dairy and frozen foods. (3) Consists primarily of produce, meat, deli and prepared foods, bakery, floral and seafood. (4) Consists primarily of wholesale sales to third parties, commissions, rental income and other miscellaneous revenue. Gross Margin Gross margin represents the portion of Net sales and other revenue remaining after deducting Cost of sales during the period, including purchase and distribution costs. These costs include, among other things, purchasing and sourcing costs, inbound freight costs, product quality testing costs, warehousing and distribution costs, Own Brands program costs and digital-related delivery and handling costs. Advertising, promotional expenses and vendor allowances are also components of Cost of sales. Gross margin rate decreased 20 basis points to 27.8% in fiscal 2023 compared to 28.0% in fiscal 2022. Excluding the impacts of fuel and LIFO, gross margin rate decreased 64 basis points. The rate decrease was primarily driven by pharmacy operations, increases in shrink and increases in picking and delivery costs related to the continued growth in our digital sales, partially offset by our procurement and sourcing productivity initiatives. The gross margin rate decrease in fiscal 2023 related to pharmacy operations was primarily due to growth in pharmacy sales and a lower margin rate on COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, the benefits from our productivity initiatives allowed us to provide incremental targeted price investments to our customers during fiscal 2023. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of store level costs, including wages, employee benefits, rent, depreciation and utilities, in addition to certain back-office expenses related to our corporate and division offices. Selling and administrative expenses remained flat at 25.2% of Net sales and other revenue in both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of fuel, Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales and other 41 Table of Contents revenue decreased 29 basis points during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The decrease in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales and other revenue was primarily attributable to sales leverage of employee costs, which includes the benefit of ongoing productivity initiatives, lower legal and regulatory accruals and settlements and lower depreciation and amortization, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses related to the ongoing development of our digital and omnichannel capabilities, ongoing Merger-related costs and increased store occupancy costs and additional third-party store security services. We expect a continued trend in increased digital spend as we enhance and maintain the modernization of our technology platforms. Loss (Gain) on Property Dispositions and Impairment Losses, Net For fiscal 2023, net loss on property dispositions and impairment losses was $43.9 million, primarily driven by the impairment and disposal of certain technology assets, partially offset by net gains from the sale of assets. For fiscal 2022, net gain on property dispositions and impairment losses was $147.5 million, primarily driven by $152.6 million of gains from the sale of real estate assets, partially offset by $5.1 million of asset impairments. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net was $492.1 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $404.6 million in fiscal 2022. The increase in Interest expense, net was primarily due to lower interest income, as well as higher average outstanding borrowings and higher average interest rates. The weighted average interest rate was 5.6% and 5.3% during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively, excluding amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs. Other Income, Net For fiscal 2023, Other income, net was $12.2 million primarily driven by non-service cost components of net pension and post-retirement income, realized gains from non-operating investments and income related to our equity interest and gain on sale of El Rancho during fiscal 2023, partially offset by realized and unrealized losses from non-operating investments. For fiscal 2022, Other income, net was $33.0 million primarily driven by non-service cost components of net pension and post-retirement income and income related to our equity investment, partially offset by unrealized losses from non-operating investments. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $293.0 million, representing a 18.4% effective tax rate, in fiscal 2023, and $422.0 million, representing a 21.8% effective tax rate, in fiscal 2022. The favorability in the effective income tax rate during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was driven by incremental benefits in the reduction of reserves for uncertain tax positions primarily due to the expiration of a foreign statute during fiscal 2023, and additional federal tax credits. Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Net income was $1,296.0 million or $2.23 per diluted share during fiscal 2023 compared to $1,513.5 million or $2.27 per diluted share during fiscal 2022. Adjusted net income was $1,693.7 million, or $2.88 per share, during fiscal 2023 compared to $1,965.1 million, or $3.37 per share, during fiscal 2022. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA was $4,317.7 million, or 5.4% of Net sales and other revenue, during fiscal 2023 compared to $4,677.0 million, or 6.0% of Net sales and other revenue, during fiscal 2022. 42 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures The following tables reconcile Net income to Adjusted net income, and diluted net income per Class A common share to Adjusted net income per Class A common share (in millions, except per share data): Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2021 Numerator: Net income $ 1,296.0 $ 1,513.5 $ 1,619.6 Adjustments: Gain on interest rate swaps and energy hedges, net (d) (3.2) (8.4) (22.8) Business transformation (1)(b) 45.1 78.3 56.6 Equity-based compensation expense (b) 104.5 138.3 101.2 Loss (gain) on property dispositions and impairment losses, net 43.9 (147.5) (15.0) LIFO expense (a) 52.0 268.0 115.2 Government-mandated incremental COVID-19 pandemic related pay (2)(b) 10.8 57.9 Merger-related costs (3)(b) 180.6 56.5 Certain legal and regulatory accruals and settlements, net (b) (6.7) 100.7 (31.0) Amortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs (c) 15.5 16.8 23.2 Loss on debt extinguishment 3.7 Amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions (b) 48.6 50.9 48.5 Combined Plan (4)(b) (19.0) (106.3) Miscellaneous adjustments (5)(f) 41.4 52.1 (23.8) Tax impact of adjustments to Adjusted net income (124.0) (145.9) (46.0) Adjusted net income $ 1,693.7 $ 1,965.1 $ 1,781.0 Denominator: Weighted average Class A common shares outstanding - diluted 581.1 534.0 475.3 Adjustments: Convertible Preferred Stock (6) 0.3 42.7 97.7 Restricted stock units and awards (7) 6.4 5.9 7.4 Adjusted weighted average Class A common shares outstanding diluted 587.8 582.6 580.4 Adjusted net income per Class A common share - diluted $ 2.88 $ 3.37 $ 3.07 43 Table of Contents Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2021 Net income per Class A common share - diluted $ 2.23 $ 2.27 $ 2.70 Convertible Preferred Stock (6) 0.36 0.13 Non-GAAP adjustments (8) 0.68 0.78 0.28 Restricted stock units and awards (7) (0.03) (0.04) (0.04) Adjusted net income per Class A common share - diluted $ 2.88 $ 3.37 $ 3.07 The following table is a reconciliation of Adjusted net income to Adjusted EBITDA: Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2021 Adjusted net income (9) $ 1,693.7 $ 1,965.1 $ 1,781.0 Tax impact of adjustments to Adjusted net income 124.0 145.9 46.0 Income tax expense 293.0 422.0 479.9 Amortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs (c) (15.5) (16.8) (23.2) Interest expense, net 492.1 404.6 481.9 Amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions (b) (48.6) (50.9) (48.5) Depreciation and amortization (e) 1,779.0 1,807.1 1,681.3 Adjusted EBITDA $ 4,317.7 $ 4,677.0 $ 4,398.4 (1) Includes costs associated with third-party consulting fees related to our operational priorities and associated business transformation.

The decrease in cash flow from operating activities during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was due to a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA and more cash paid for income taxes, ongoing Merger-related costs, legal settlements and interest. The decrease was partially offset by changes in working capital primarily related to inventory and accounts payable, including the final payment in fiscal 2022 related to the CARES Act deferral of the employer-paid portion of social security taxes. Net Cash Used In Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2023 was $1,746.7 million primarily due to payments for property, equipment and intangibles of $2,036.6 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of 45 Table of Contents $217.6 million, which includes $166.1 million related to the sale of our equity interest in El Rancho during fiscal 2023. Payments for property, equipment and intangibles included the completion of 150 remodels, the opening of six new stores and continued investment in our digital and technology platforms. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2022 was $1,977.3 million primarily due to payments for property, equipment and intangibles of $2,156.7 million, partially offset by proceeds primarily from the sale of real estate assets of $195.2 million. Payments for property, equipment and intangibles included continued investments in our digital and technology platforms, the completion of 173 remodels, and the opening of five new stores. In fiscal 2024, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion. Net Cash Used In Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $1,183.4 million in fiscal 2023 primarily consisting of the $950.0 million partial repayment of the asset-based loan facility (as amended, the "ABL Facility") and dividends paid on our Class A common stock, partially offset by $150.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of debt under the ABL Facility. Net cash used in financing activities was $3,365.4 million in fiscal 2022 primarily consisting of dividends paid on our Class A common stock and Convertible Preferred Stock, including the $3,916.9 million payment of the special cash dividend of $6.85 per share of Class A common stock (the "Special Dividend") during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, partially offset by the $1,400.0 million borrowing and $400.0 million subsequent partial repayment of the ABL Facility in respect of the Special Dividend. Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and payments on long-term debt also included a $750 million issuance and subsequent $750 million redemption of senior unsecured notes. See "Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 and Note 8" for additional information. Debt Management Total debt, including both the current and long-term portions of finance lease obligations, net of debt discounts and deferred financing costs, decreased $841.5 million to $8,068.6 million as of the end of fiscal 2023 compared to $8,910.1 million as of the end of fiscal 2022. Outstanding debt, including current maturities, net of debt discounts and deferred financing costs, principally consisted of (in millions): February 24, 2024 Senior Unsecured Notes, New Albertson's L.P. Notes and Safeway Inc. Notes $ 7,361.9 ABL Facility 200.0 Finance lease obligations 460.4 Other financing obligations and mortgage notes payable 46.3 Total debt, including finance leases $ 8,068.6 During fiscal 2023, we repaid $800.0 million, net, of the ABL Facility. As of February 24, 2024, we had $200.0 million of borrowings that remained outstanding under the ABL Facility and total availability of $3,751.7 million (net of letter of credit usage). During fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, there were no financial maintenance covenants in effect under the ABL Facility because the conditions had not been met. 46 Table of Contents See "Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6" for additional information. Dividends We have established a dividend policy pursuant to which we intend to pay a quarterly dividend on our Class A common stock. Cash dividends paid on our Class A common stock were $276.2 million ($0.48 per common share), $255.1 million ($0.48 per common share) and $207.4 million ($0.44 per common share) during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. On April 11, 2024, we announced the next quarterly dividend payment of $0.12 per share of Class A common stock to be paid on May 10, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 26, 2024. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the conversion of the remaining Convertible Preferred Stock was completed. The holders of Convertible Preferred Stock were entitled to a quarterly dividend at a rate per annum of 6.75% of the liquidation preference per share of the Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the holders of Convertible Preferred Stock participated in cash dividends that we pay on our common stock to the extent that such cash dividends exceed $206.25 million per fiscal year and shares of Convertible Preferred Stock remain outstanding as of the applicable record date to participate in such dividends. Cash dividends paid to holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock were $0.8 million, $65.3 million and $114.6 million during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. On October 13, 2022, we declared the Special Dividend, payable to stockholders of record, including holders of Series A preferred stock on an as-converted basis, as of the close of business on October 24, 2022. On January 20, 2023, the Special Dividend of $3,916.9 million was paid. Liquidity and Factors Affecting Liquidity Based on current operating trends, we believe that we have significant sources of cash to meet our liquidity needs for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future, including cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our ABL Facility. We estimate our liquidity needs over the next 12 months to be in the range of $5,100 million to $5,300 million. This includes $200.0 million related to outstanding borrowings under our ABL Facility for which we may, at our discretion, elect to pay all or a portion of the outstanding balance within the next 12 months, and anticipated requirements for incremental working capital, incremental Merger-related costs, capital expenditures, pension obligations, interest payments, quarterly dividends on Class A common stock, operating leases and finance leases. In addition, we may enter into refinancing and sale leaseback transactions from time to time. We believe we have adequate cash flow to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions. The table below presents our material cash requirements as of February 24, 2024 (in millions): Payments Due Per Fiscal Year (1) Total 2024 2025-2026 2027-2028 Thereafter Long-term debt (2) $ 7,684.2 $ 217.0 $ 2,774.2 $ 1,700.6 $ 2,992.4 Estimated interest on long-term debt (3) 1,700.6 403.0 741.3 399.1 157.2 Operating leases (4) 8,727.4 974.3 1,932.9 1,598.3 4,221.9 Finance leases (4) 666.2 94.7 166.7 120.5 284.3 Other obligations (5) 1,774.9 390.9 491.6 222.7 669.7 Purchase obligations (6) 493.0 285.2 180.6 14.1 13.1 Total contractual obligations $ 21,046.3 $ 2,365.1 $ 6,287.3 $ 4,055.3 $ 8,338.6 (1) The cash requirements table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which totaled $18.3 million in fiscal 2023 and is expected to total approximately $85 million in fiscal 2024. This table also excludes recurring contributions under various multiemployer pension plans, which totaled $545.5 million in fiscal 2023 and is expected to total approximately $560 million in fiscal 2024. 47 Table of Contents (2) Long-term debt amounts exclude any debt discounts and deferred financing costs. See "Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6" for additional information. (3) Amounts include contractual interest payments using the stated fixed interest rate or the variable interest rate in effect as of February 24, 2024. See "Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6" for additional information. (4) Represents the minimum rents payable under operating and finance leases, excluding common area maintenance, insurance or tax payments, for which we are obligated. (5) Consists of self-insurance liabilities, which have not been reduced by insurance-related receivables, as well as payment obligations related to the Combined Plan. The table excludes the unfunded pension and postretirement benefit obligation of $259.8 million. The potential settlement payments related to unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined. Also excludes deferred tax liabilities and certain other deferred liabilities that will not be settled in cash. (6) Purchase obligations include various obligations that have specified purchase commitments. As of February 24, 2024, future purchase obligations primarily relate to fixed asset, marketing and information technology commitments, including fixed price contracts. In addition, not included in the contractual obligations table are supply contracts to purchase product for resale to consumers which are typically of a short-term nature with limited or no purchase commitments. We also enter into supply contracts which typically include either volume commitments or fixed expiration dates, termination provisions and other customary contractual considerations. The supply contracts that are cancelable have not been included above. Multiemployer Pension Plans We currently contribute to 27 multiemployer plans which provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose and the respective plan trustees are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants, the management of the plan assets and plan administration. We continue to monitor any potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer plans for our associates who are beneficiaries of these plans. The underfunding of any of these plans to which we contribute are not our liability and though we are not obligated nor the guarantor for any of the underfunding, we have estimated, based on the ratio of our contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans, our allocable share of the underfunding (the amount by which the actuarial determined plan liabilities exceed the value of the plan assets) of these multiemployer plans to which we contribute to be approximately $4.5 billion. The American Rescue Plan Act ("ARP Act") establishes a special financial assistance program for financially troubled multiemployer pension plans. Under the ARP Act, eligible multiemployer plans can apply to receive a one-time cash payment in the amount projected by the PBGC to pay pension benefits through the plan year ending 2051. The payment received by the multiemployer plan under this special financial assistance program would not be considered a loan and would not need to be paid back. Any financial assistance received by the multiemployer plan would need to be segregated from the other assets of the multiemployer plans and invested in investment grade bonds or other investments permitted by the PBGC. Of the 27 multiemployer plans to which we contribute, 16 plans are classified as "Critical" or "Critical and Declining" and potentially eligible for some level of relief under the special financial assistance program through the ARP Act. On July 9, 2021, the PBGC issued its interim final rule with respect to the special financial assistance program. The PBGC interim final rule provides direction on the application requirements, identifies which plans will have priority, eligibility requirements, the determination of the amount of financial assistance to be provided and establishes conditions and restrictions that apply to plans that receive assistance. During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the PBGC issued the final rule with respect to the special financial assistance program which allowed for both additional funding and the investment of one third of the special financial assistance funds into return-seeking investments. Though the amount of financial assistance that each of these 16 plans could receive will vary by plan, we currently estimate that these 16 plans represent over 90% of the $4.5 billion estimated underfunding. Under the PBGC guidance, these multiemployer plans can apply for assistance based on a priority designation set by the PBGC starting in March 2023 through December 2025. We expect the special financial assistance program 48 Table of Contents under these regulations to provide the funding for these plans to remain solvent for at least the next 25 to 30 years and continue to provide benefits to our associates who are beneficiaries of these multiemployer plans. We will continue to make our contributions based on collective bargaining agreements for each of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute. Our contributions to multiemployer plans were $545.5 million, $546.5 million and $523.7 million during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively, and we expect to contribute approximately $560 million in fiscal 2024. Refer to "Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors" and "Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 11" for additional information. Guarantees We are party to a variety of contractual agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts, operating leases and other real estate contracts, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements and various other agreements. Under these agreements, we may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (for example, ownership of assets, environmental or tax indemnifications) or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined. We believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial statements. We are liable for certain operating leases that were assigned to third parties. If any of these third parties fail to perform their obligations under the leases, we could be responsible for the lease obligation. Because of the wide dispersion among third parties and the variety of remedies available, we believe that if an assignee became insolvent it would not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into various supply contracts to purchase products for resale and purchase and service contracts for fixed asset and information technology commitments. We have also entered into fixed price contracts to purchase electricity and natural gas for a portion of our energy needs. These contracts typically include volume commitments or fixed expiration dates, termination provisions and other standard contractual considerations. Letters of Credit We had letters of credit of $48.3 million outstanding as of February 24, 2024. The letters of credit are maintained primarily to support our performance, payment, deposit or surety obligations. We typically pay bank fees of 1.25% plus a fronting fee of 0.125% on the face amount of the letters of credit. NEW ACCOUNTING POLICIES See "Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1" for new accounting pronouncements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a fair and consistent manner. See "Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1" for a discussion of our significant accounting policies. 49 Table of Contents Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more subjective or complex judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Self-Insurance Liabilities We are primarily self-insured for workers' compensation, property, automobile and general liability. The self-insurance liability is undiscounted and determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. We have established stop-loss amounts that limit our further exposure after a claim reaches the designated stop-loss threshold. In determining our self-insurance liabilities, we perform a continuing review of our overall position and reserving techniques. Since recorded amounts are based on estimates, the ultimate cost of all incurred claims and related expenses may be more or less than the recorded liabilities. Any actuarial projection of self-insured losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes, claim settlement patterns and similar factors influenced historical development trends that were used to determine the current year expense and, therefore, contributed to the variability in the annual expense. However, these factors are not direct inputs into the actuarial projection, and thus their individual impact cannot be quantified. Contingencies We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either reasonably possible or it is reasonably possible that an estimated liability could materially change. If a loss or change in the estimated liability has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the nature of the uncertainty and estimate of possible loss or range of loss to the extent such estimate can be made. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and whether a reasonable estimate of the loss can be made. The assessment of the outcome of litigation can be very difficult to predict as it is subject to legal processes that are highly complex, subject to many factors, including those that are not within our control, and highly dependent on individual facts and circumstances. While management currently believes that the estimated liabilities currently recorded are reasonable, it remains possible that differences in actual outcomes or changes in management's evaluation or predictions could arise that could be material to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13" and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated settlement in these matters could be material to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
