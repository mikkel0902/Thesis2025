Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management Overview We believe our 2022 operating performance demonstrates the continued momentum of our operations, confirms the resilience of our markets, and reflects the considerable capabilities of our experienced team to overcome the uncertainties of the current environment. Throughout the turbulence, we maintained and further extended our ongoing advantages in our products, brands and people. At the same time, we leveraged existing proficiencies to focus on expanding our professional customer base, not only in automotive repair, but in adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including critical industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high. Snap-on value proposition of making work easier for serious professionals is an ongoing strength as we move forward along our runways for coherent growth: Enhancing the franchise network, where we continued to focus on helping our franchisees extend their reach through innovative selling processes and productivity initiatives that break the traditional time and space barriers inherent in a mobile van; Expanding with repair shop owners and managers, where we continued to make progress in connecting with customers and translating the resulting insights into innovation that solves specific challenges in the repair facility; Further extending to critical industries, where we continued to grow our lines of products customized for specific industries, including through further integration of acquisitions; and Building in emerging markets, where we continued to maintain manufacturing capacity, as well as refine product lines and distribution capabilities. Our strategic priorities and plans for 2023 involve continuing to build on our Snap-on Value Creation Processes our suite of strategic principles and processes we employ every day designed to create value, and employed in the areas of safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement ( Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI ). We expect to continue to deploy these processes in our existing operations as well as into our recently acquired businesses. Snap-on RCI initiatives employ a structured set of tools and processes across multiple businesses and geographies intended to eliminate waste and improve operations. Savings from Snap-on RCI initiatives reflect benefits from a wide variety of ongoing efficiency, productivity and process improvements, including savings generated from product design cost reductions, improved manufacturing line set-up and change-over practices, lower-cost sourcing initiatives and facility consolidations. Unless individually significant, it is not practicable to disclose each RCI activity that generated savings and/or segregate RCI savings embedded in sales volume increases. Our global financial services operations continue to serve a significant strategic role in offering financing options to our franchisees, to their customers, and to customers in other parts of our business. We expect that our global financial services business, which includes both Snap-on Credit LLC ( SOC ) in the United States and our other international finance subsidiaries, will continue to be a meaningful contributor to our operating earnings going forward. Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to risks inherent with foreign operations, including foreign currency translation fluctuations. Recent Acquisitions On August 1, 2021, Snap-on acquired AutoCrib EMEA GmbH ( AutoCrib Germany ), for a cash purchase price of $4.4 million (or $4.2 million, net of cash acquired). AutoCrib Germany, based in Hamburg, Germany, distributes asset and tool control solutions for a variety of aerospace, automotive, military, natural resources and general industry operations. The acquisition of AutoCrib Germany, a former independent distributor, enhanced and expanded Snap-on capabilities in providing solutions for the company existing tool control offerings. On July 1, 2021, Snap-on exchanged its 35% equity interest in Deville S.A., valued at $21.8 million, for 100% ownership of Secateurs Pradines ( Pradines ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Deville S.A. with a fair value of $20.2 million (or $15.7 million, net of cash acquired), and cash of $1.6 million. Pradines, located in Bauge-en-Anjou, France, designs and manufactures horticultural hand tools for professionals and individuals. Pradines has been the primary supplier of pruning products to Snap on and the acquisition allows the company to improve and expand its pruning tool offering. 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 27 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) On February 26, 2021, Snap-on acquired Dealer-FX Group, Inc. ( Dealer-FX ) for a cash purchase price of $200.1 million (or $200.0 million, net of cash acquired). Dealer-FX, based in Markham, Ontario, is a leading developer, marketer and provider of service-operations software solutions for automotive original equipment manufacturer ( OEM ) customers and their dealers. Dealer-FX specializes in software as a service (SaaS) management systems, communications platforms, extensive data integrations, and offers a digitalized solution that increases productivity and enhances the vehicle owners experience. The acquisition of Dealer-FX complemented and expanded Snap-on existing OEM and dealership business that provides electronic parts catalogs, essential tool and diagnostic programs, and custom analytics to OEMs and dealerships. For segment reporting purposes, the results of operations and assets of Dealer-FX have been included in the Repair Systems & Information Group since the acquisition date, and the results of operations and assets of AutoCrib Germany and Pradines have been included in the Commercial & Industrial Group since the respective acquisition dates. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for any of these acquisitions as the net effects, individually and collectively, were neither significant nor material to Snap-on results of operations or financial position. Fiscal Year Snap-on fiscal year ends on the Saturday that is on or nearest to December 31. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this document to fiscal 2022 or 2022 refer to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022; references to fiscal 2021 or 2021 refer to the fiscal year ended January 1, 2022; and references to fiscal 2020 or 2020 refer to the fiscal year ended January 2, 2021. References in this document to 2022, 2021 and 2020 year end refer to December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022, and January 2, 2021, respectively. Snap-on 2022 and 2021 fiscal years each contained 52 weeks of operating results. Snap-on 2020 fiscal year contained 53 weeks of operating results with the extra week occurring in the fourth quarter. The impact of the additional week of operations in fiscal 2020 was not material to Snap-on full year or fourth quarter total revenues or net earnings. Fiscal 2021 as Compared to Fiscal 2020 A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 can be found under Part II, Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report on the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on February 10, 2022, and is available on the SEC website at www.sec.gov as well as in the Investors section of our website at www.snapon.com . 28 SNAP-ON INCORPORATED Non-GAAP Measures References in this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to organic sales refer to sales from continuing operations calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ), adjusted to exclude acquisition-related sales and the impact of foreign currency translation. Management evaluates the company sales performance based on organic sales growth, which primarily reflects growth from the company existing businesses as a result of increased output, expanded customer base, geographic expansion, new product development and pricing changes, and excludes sales contributions from acquired operations the company did not own as of the comparable prior-year reporting period. Organic sales also exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying growth trends in the company businesses and facilitates comparisons of its sales performance with prior periods. Effect of COVID-19 Our markets and our operations possess and, indeed, have demonstrated considerable resilience against the effects of the pandemic. The company sustained the accommodation of its operations to the virus environment, continuing without significant disruption to serve its franchisees and other professional customers as they performed their essential work, while taking what it believes to be appropriate measures to ensure the health and safety of its people. Throughout the pandemic, Snap-on has generally maintained its workforce and manufacturing capacity, as well as its investments in brand building and product development. As the global supply chain inefficiencies and associated cost increases caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have developed, the company has taken steps to ensure access to raw materials, components and purchased finished goods, and to provide for counterbalancing price and efficiency offsets.

As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $393.3 million in 2022, including $4.8 million of favorable foreign currency effects, increased $44.7 million, or 12.8%, from $348.6 million in 2021. Operating margin for the Repair Systems & Information Group of 23.6% in 2022 compared to 23.2% last year. Financial Services (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Change Financial services revenue $ 349.7 100.0 % $ 349.7 100.0 % $ Financial services expenses (83.7) (23.9) % (77.7) (22.2) % (6.0) (7.7) % Segment operating earnings $ 266.0 76.1 % $ 272.0 77.8 % $ (6.0) (2.2) % Financial services revenue is generally dependent on the size of the average financial services portfolio during the period, as well as on the average yield on receivables. Financial services revenue of $349.7 million in 2022 was unchanged from 2021 , as the benefits from the slightly larger average financial services portfolio were offset by the slightly lower average yield in 2022 as compared to last year. In 2022 and 2021, the respective average yields on finance receivables were 17.6% and 17.7%. In both 2022 and 2021, the average yield on contract receivables was 8.5%. Originations of $1,153.1 million in 2022 increased $79.9 million, or 7.4%, from 2021 levels. Financial services expenses primarily include personnel-related and other general and administrative costs, as well as expenses for credit losses. These expenses are generally more dependent on changes in the financial services portfolio than they are on the revenue of the segment. Financial services expenses in 2022 increased $6.0 million from last year primarily due to higher provisions for credit losses as compared to those recorded in 2021. As a percentage of the average financial services portfolio, financial services expenses were 3.7% and 3.5% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $266.0 million in 2022, including $2.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased $6.0 million, or 2.2%, from 2021 levels. See Note 1 and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on financial services. Corporate Snap-on general corporate expenses in 2022 of $108.4 million decreased $9.7 million from $118.1 million last year.

Snap-on believes that its cash from operations and collections of finance receivables, coupled with its sources of borrowings and available cash on hand, are sufficient to fund its currently anticipated requirements for scheduled debt repayments, payments of interest and dividends, new receivables originated by our financial services businesses, capital expenditures, working capital, the funding of pension plans, and funding for share repurchases and acquisitions, if and as they arise. Due to Snap-on credit rating over the years, external funds have been available at an acceptable cost. As of February 3, 2023, Snap-on long-term debt and commercial paper were rated, respectively, A2 and P-1 by Moody Investors Service; A- and A-2 by Standard & Poor s; and A and F1 by Fitch Ratings. Snap-on believes that its current credit arrangements are sound and that the strength of its balance sheet affords the company the financial flexibility, including through access to financial markets for potential new financing, to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions. However, Snap-on cannot provide any assurance that financing will be available in the future on acceptable terms, or that its debt ratings will not decrease. The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of 2022 year end, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $2,397.3 million increased $326.1 million from $2,071.2 million as of 2021 year end primarily as a result of other net changes in working capital discussed below.

These decreases in cash and cash equivalents were partially offset by: (i) $826.9 million of cash from collections of finance receivables; (ii) $675.2 million of cash generated from operations; (iii) $55.0 million of cash proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises; and (iv) $1.6 million of net proceeds from other short-term borrowings. Of the $757.2 million of cash and cash equivalents as of 2022 year end, $244.1 million was held outside of the United States. Snap-on maintains non-U.S. funds in its foreign operations to: (i) provide adequate working capital; (ii) satisfy various regulatory requirements; and/or (iii) take advantage of business expansion opportunities as they arise. Although the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act ) generally eliminated U.S. federal taxation of dividends from foreign subsidiaries, such dividends may still be subject to state income taxation and foreign withholding taxes. Snap-on periodically evaluates its cash held outside the United States and may pursue opportunities to repatriate certain foreign cash amounts to the extent that it can be accomplished in a tax efficient manner. 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 43 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Trade and other accounts receivable net of $761.7 million as of 2022 year end increased $79.4 million from 2021 year-end levels primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by $18.2 million of foreign currency translation. Days sales outstanding (trade and other accounts receivable net as of the respective period end, divided by the respective trailing 12 months sales, times 360 days) was 61 days and 58 days at the respective 2022 and 2021 year ends. The current portions of net finance and contract receivables of $672.1 million as of 2022 year end compared to $652.7 million at 2021 year end. The long-term portions of net finance and contract receivables of $1,554.6 million as of 2022 year end compared to $1,492.2 million at 2021 year end. The combined $81.8 million increase in net current and long-term finance and contract receivables compared to 2021 year-end levels is primarily due to an increase in net receivable originations, partially offset by $20.5 million of foreign currency translation. Inventories net of $1,033.1 million as of 2022 year end increased $229.3 million from 2021 year-end levels primarily due to higher demand, increased costs and from efforts to manage the current supply chain situation, partially offset by $29.3 million of foreign currency translation. As of 2022 and 2021 year end, inventory turns (trailing 12 months of cost of goods sold, divided by the average of the beginning and ending inventory balance for the trailing 12 months) were 2.5 turns and 2.8 turns, respectively. Inventories accounted for using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method as of 2022 and 2021 year end approximated 61% and 60% of total inventories, respectively. All other inventories are accounted for using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method. The company LIFO reserve was $108.6 million and $87.2 million at 2022 and 2021 year end, respectively. Notes payable of $17.2 million as of 2022 year end compared to $17.4 million as of 2021 year end. Average notes payable outstanding were $18.6 million and $16.7 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The 2022 weighted-average interest rate on such borrowings of 9.93% compared with 8.39% in 2021. At 2022 year end, the weighted-average rate on outstanding notes payable of 10.89% compared with 8.39% in 2021. The 2022 year-end rate increased primarily due to higher rates on local borrowings in emerging markets. Accounts payable of $287.0 million as of 2022 year end increased $9.4 million from 2021 year-end levels, primarily due to the timing of payments, partially offset by $7.4 million of foreign currency translation. Other accrued liabilities of $436.4 million as of 2022 year end increased $12.1 million from 2021 year-end levels, primarily due to higher income tax accruals, partially offset by $11.7 million of foreign currency translation. Long-term debt of $1,183.8 million as of 2022 year end consisted of: (i) $300.0 million of unsecured 3.25% notes that mature on March 1, 2027 (the 2027 Notes ); (ii) $400.0 million of unsecured 4.10% notes that mature on March 1, 2048 ( the 2048 Notes ); and (iii) $500.0 million of 3.10% notes that mature on May 1, 2050 (the 2050 Notes ), partially offset by $16.2 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. Snap-on has an $800 million multi-currency revolving credit facility that terminates on September 16, 2024 (the Credit Facility ); no amounts were borrowed or outstanding under the Credit Facility during the year ended and as of December 31, 2022 or January 1, 2022. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at varying rates based on either: (i) Snap-on then-current, long-term debt ratings; or (ii) Snap-on then-current ratio of consolidated debt net of certain cash adjustments ( Consolidated Net Debt ) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain other adjustments for the preceding four fiscal quarters then ended (the Consolidated Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio ). The Credit Facility financial covenant requires that Snap-on maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, either (i) a ratio not greater than 0.60 to 1.00 of Consolidated Net Debt to the sum of Consolidated Net Debt plus total equity and less accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (the Leverage Ratio ); or (ii) a Consolidated Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio not greater than 3.50 to 1.00. Snap-on may, up to two times during any five-year period during the term of the Credit Facility (including any extensions thereof), elect to increase the maximum Leverage Ratio to 0.65 to 1.00 and/or increase the maximum Consolidated Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio to 4.00 to 1.00 for four consecutive fiscal quarters in connection with certain material acquisitions (as defined in the related credit agreement). As of December 31, 2022, the company actual ratios of 0.09 and 0.37 respectively, were both within the permitted ranges set forth in this financial covenant. Snap-on generally issues commercial paper to fund its financing needs on a short-term basis and uses the Credit Facility as back-up liquidity to support such commercial paper issuances. There was no commercial paper issued or outstanding during the year ended and as of December 31, 2022 or January 1, 2022. Snap-on Credit Facility and other debt agreements also contain certain usual and customary borrowing, affirmative, negative and maintenance covenants. As of 2022 year end, Snap-on was in compliance with all covenants of its Credit Facility and other debt agreements. 44 SNAP-ON INCORPORATED Snap-on believes it has sufficient available cash and access to both committed and uncommitted credit facilities to cover its expected funding needs on both a short-term and long-term basis. Snap-on manages its aggregate short-term borrowings so as not to exceed its availability under the Credit Facility. Snap-on believes that it can access short-term debt markets, predominantly through commercial paper issuances and existing lines of credit, to fund its short-term requirements and to ensure near-term liquidity. Snap-on regularly monitors the credit and financial markets and, if it believes conditions are favorable, it may take advantage of such conditions to issue long-term debt to further improve its liquidity and capital resources. Near-term liquidity requirements for Snap-on include payments of interest and dividends, funding to support new receivables originated by our financial services businesses, capital expenditures, working capital, the funding of pension plans, and funding for share repurchases and acquisitions, if and as they arise. Snap-on intends to make contributions of $6.9 million to its foreign pension plans and $2.4 million to its domestic pension plans in 2023, as required by law. Depending on market and other conditions, Snap-on may make discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2023. Snap-on long-term financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to the debt markets to accommodate its liquidity needs, including the potential use of commercial paper, additional fixed-term debt and/or securitizations. The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $675.2 million in 2022 decreased $291.4 million from $966.6 million in 2021. The $291.4 million decrease is primarily due to a $354.5 million change in net operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $92.5 million increase in net earnings. Depreciation expense was $71.5 million in 2022 and $75.6 million in 2021. Amortization expense was $28.7 million in 2022 and $29.2 million in 2021. See Note 6 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets. Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities of $206.2 million in 2022 included additions to finance receivables of $955.8 million, partially offset by collections of $826.9 million. Net cash used by investing activities of $290.4 million in 2021 included additions to finance receivables of $878.1 million, partially offset by collections of $854.2 million. Finance receivables are comprised of extended-term installment payment contracts to both technicians and independent shop owners (i.e., franchisees customers) to enable them to purchase tools, diagnostics, and equipment products on an extended-term payment plan, with average payment terms of approximately four years. Net cash used by investing activities in 2022 also included $0.5 million of cash provided by acquisitions. Net cash used by investing activities in 2021 included $199.7 million for the acquisitions of Dealer-FX, AutoCrib Germany and Pradines. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about acquisitions. Capital expenditures in 2022 and 2021 totaled $84.2 million and $70.1 million, respectively. Capital expenditures in both years included continued investments related to the company execution of its strategic Value Creation Processes. The company also invested in: (i) new product, efficiency, safety and cost reduction initiatives that are intended to expand and improve its manufacturing and distribution capabilities worldwide; (ii) new production and machine tooling to enhance manufacturing operations, as well as ongoing replacements of manufacturing and distribution equipment, particularly in the United States; and (iii) the ongoing enhancement of the company global enterprise resource planning (ERP) management information systems. Snap-on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as its available cash on hand and funds available from its credit facilities will be sufficient to fund the company capital expenditure requirements in 2023. 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 45 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities of $485.0 million in 2022 included net proceeds from other short-term borrowings of $1.6 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $818.8 million in 2021 included the $250.0 million repayment of the 2021 Notes at maturity and net proceeds from other short-term borrowings of $3.3 million. Proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises totaled $55.0 million in 2022 and $162.4 million in 2021. In 2022, Snap-on repurchased 899,000 shares of its common stock for $198.1 million under its previously announced share repurchase programs. As of 2022 year end, Snap-on had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $362.4 million in common stock pursuant to its Board authorizations. Snap-on repurchased 1,943,900 shares of its common stock for $431.3 million in 2021. The repurchase of Snap-on common stock to offset dilution related to equity plan issuances or for other corporate purposes is at the company discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market conditions. Snap-on believes that its cash generated from operations, available cash on hand, and funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund the company additional share repurchases, if any. Snap-on has paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends, without interruption or reduction, since 1939. Cash dividends paid in 2022 and 2021 totaled $313.1 million and $275.8 million, respectively. On November 4, 2022, the company announced that its Board increased the quarterly cash dividend by 14.1% to $1.62 per share ($6.48 per share annualized). Quarterly dividends in 2022 were $1.62 per share in the fourth quarter and $1.42 per share in the first three quarters ($5.88 per share for the year). Quarterly dividends in 2021 were $1.42 per share in the fourth quarter and $1.23 per share in the first three quarters ($5.11 per share for the year). 2022 2021 Cash dividends paid per common share $ 5.88 $ 5.11 Cash dividends paid as a percentage of prior-year retained earnings 5.5 % 5.3 % Snap-on believes that its cash generated from operations, available cash on hand, and funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to pay dividends in 2023. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Snap-on contractual obligations for long-term debt and operating and finance leases are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets; see Note 10 and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the company long-term debt and leases. Snap-on also enters into contracts for future purchases in the normal course of business. As of year-end 2022, the company had $165.2 million in purchase commitments to be paid in 2023 and $10.9 million to be paid thereafter. Snap-on intends to make contributions of $6.9 million to its foreign pension plans and $2.4 million to its domestic pension plans in 2023, as required by law. Depending on market and other conditions, Snap-on may make additional discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2023; see Note 12 and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the company benefit plans and payments. Due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, Snap-on is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits totaling $5.6 million for its remaining uncertain tax liabilities. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on income taxes. 46 SNAP-ON INCORPORATED Environmental Matters Snap-on is subject to various federal, state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Snap-on policy is to comply with these requirements and the company believes that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with its business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of Snap-on operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. Snap-on is and has been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. Snap-on believes that, as a general matter, its handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could affect the company handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. In recent years there has been increased public awareness, concern and focus on environmental and sustainability issues, including matters related to global climate change. The current focus on these matters is expected to result in additional and/or more restrictive regulations, requirements and/or industry or third-party standards to reduce or mitigate global warming and other environmental or sustainability risks, though the timing is uncertain. Snap-on continues to monitor developments in this area. New Accounting Standards See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on new accounting standards. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are generally based on historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition to the company significant accounting policies described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Snap-on considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Allowance for Credit Losses on Finance Receivables: The allowance for credit losses on finance receivables is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover expected losses in Snap-on finance receivables portfolio as of the reporting date. The allowance represents management estimate of the expected losses in the company finance receivables portfolio based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the receivables portfolio considering collectability, historical loss experience, current conditions and future market changes. Determination of the proper level of allowance requires management to exercise judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and, as a result, net earnings. The allowance takes into consideration numerous quantitative and qualitative factors that include receivable type, historical loss experience, delinquency trends, collection experience, current and future economic conditions and credit risk characteristics. Some of these factors are influenced by items such as the customers financial condition, past payment experience, credit bureau and proprietary Snap-on credit model information, as well as the value of the underlying collateral. Changes in economic conditions and assumptions, including the resulting credit quality metrics relative to the performance of the finance receivables portfolio, create uncertainty and could result in changes to both the allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses. 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 47 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Management utilizes established policies and procedures in an effort to ensure the estimates and assumptions are well controlled, reviewed and consistently applied. As of December 31, 2022, the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to finance receivables was 3.39%. As of January 1, 2022, the allowance ratio was 3.90%. While management believes it exercises prudent judgment and applies reasonable assumptions in establishing its estimates for allowances for finance receivables, there can be no assurance that changes in economic conditions or other factors would not adversely impact the financial health of our customers and result in changes to the estimates used in the allowance calculation. For reference, a 100 bps increase in the allowance ratios for finance receivables as of December 31, 2022, would have increased Snap-on 2022 provision for credit losses and related allowance for credit losses by approximately $17.9 million. For additional information on Snap-on allowances for credit losses, see Note 1 and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairment of Goodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. Annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year using information available as of April month end. Snap-on evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates. Estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level. The company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results. Within its four reportable operating segments, the company has identified 11 reporting units. Snap-on evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates. The future projections, which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company operating plans, are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. This approach reflects management internal outlook at the reporting units, which management believes provides the best determination of value due to management insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates, price increases, working capital levels, expected benefits from RCI initiatives, and a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested. The company methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a year-over-year basis; the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2022 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of then-current market and business conditions. Snap-on continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company reporting units in an orderly transaction. In the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, the company would then record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value. Inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates, including material assumptions about future revenue, profitability and cash flows, the company operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators. Should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill is associated incur significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as declines in profitability and cash flow due to long-term deterioration in macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, the loss of key customers, changes in technology or markets, changes in key personnel or litigation, a sustained decrease in share price and/or other events, some or all of the recorded goodwill could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on Snap-on financial position or results of operations. 48 SNAP-ON INCORPORATED Snap-on completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill in the second quarter of 2022, which did not result in any impairment. As of 2022 year end, the company has no accumulated impairment losses. Although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations, such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. In performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units. Based on the company second quarter 2022 impairment testing, and assuming a hypothetical 10% decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units, the hypothetical fair value of each of the company 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about goodwill. Pension Benefits: The pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with GAAP and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of Snap-on control, such as changes in economic conditions, and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements. Snap-on believes that the two most critical assumptions are (i) the expected return on plan assets; and (ii) the assumed discount rate. Snap-on domestic pension plans have a long-term investment horizon and a total return strategy that emphasizes a capital growth objective. In 2022, the long-term investment performance objective for Snap-on domestic plans assets was to achieve net of expense returns that met or exceeded the 6.5% domestic expected return on plan assets assumption. Snap-on uses a three-year, market-related value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its domestic plans assets. As of 2022 year end, Snap-on domestic pension plans assets comprised approximately 87% of the company worldwide pension plan assets. Based on forward-looking capital market expectations, Snap-on selected an expected return on plan assets assumption for its U.S. pension plans of 7.5%, an increase of 100 bps from 2022, to be used in determining pension expense for 2023. In estimating the domestic expected return on plan assets, Snap-on utilizes a nominal returns forecasting method. For each asset class, future returns are estimated by identifying the premium of riskier asset classes over lower risk alternatives. The methodology constructs expected returns using a building block approach to the individual components of total return. These forecasts are stated in both nominal and real (after inflation) terms. This process first considers the long-term historical return premium based on the longest set of data available for each asset class. These premiums, calculated using the geometric mean, are then adjusted based on current relative valuation levels, macro-economic conditions, and the expected alpha related to active investment management. The asset return assumption is also adjusted by an implicit expense load for estimated administrative and investment-related expenses. Since asset allocation is a key determinant of expected investment returns, the current and expected mix of plan assets are also considered when setting the assumption. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected rate of return assumption for Snap-on domestic pension plans assets by 50 bps would have increased Snap-on 2022 domestic pension expense by approximately $6.8 million. The objective of Snap-on discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. In making this determination, the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans. The domestic discount rate as of 2022 and 2021 year end was selected based on a cash flow matching methodology developed by the company outside actuaries that incorporates a review of current economic conditions. This methodology matches the plans yearly projected cash flows for benefits and service costs to those of hypothetical bond portfolios using high-quality, AA rated or better, corporate bonds from either Moody Investors Service or Standard & Poor credit rating agencies available at the measurement date. This technique calculates bond portfolios that produce adequate cash flows to pay the plans projected yearly benefits and then selects the portfolio with the highest yield and uses that yield as the recommended discount rate. 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 49 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) The selection of the 5.5% weighted-average discount rate for Snap-on domestic pension plans as of 2022 year end (compared to 2.9% as of 2021 year end) represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments. Lowering Snap-on domestic discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased Snap-on 2022 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $4.5 million and $48.6 million, respectively. As of 2022 year end, Snap-on domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 85% of Snap-on worldwide projected benefit obligation. The weighted-average discount rate for Snap-on foreign pension plans of 4.8% (compared to 2.0% as of 2021 year end) represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments. Lowering Snap-on foreign discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased Snap-on 2022 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $1.4 million and $12.3 million, respectively. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants. Prior service costs and credits resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants. To determine the 2023 net periodic benefit cost, Snap-on is using weighted-average discount rates for its domestic and foreign pension plans of 5.5% and 4.8%, respectively, and an expected return on plan assets for its domestic pension plans of 7.5%. The expected returns on plan assets for foreign pension plans ranged from 2.2% to 6.9% as of 2022 year end. Due to the net change in these two key assumptions, in addition to the overall benefit plan status, Snap-on expects to have pension income in 2023. Other factors, such as changes in plan demographics and discretionary contributions, may further increase or decrease pension income in 2023. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on pension plans. Outlook We believe that our markets and our operations possess and have demonstrated considerable resilience against the varying turbulence evident in the current environment. In 2023, despite the uncertainties, Snap-on expects to make continued progress along its defined runways for coherent growth, leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena and developing and expanding its professional customer base, not only in automotive repair, but in adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including extending in critical industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high. In pursuit of these initiatives, it is projected that capital expenditures in 2023 will be in a range of $90 million to $100 million. Snap-on continues to respond to global macroeconomic challenges through its RCI process and other cost reduction initiatives. Snap-on currently anticipates that its full year 2023 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. 50 SNAP-ON INCORPORATED
