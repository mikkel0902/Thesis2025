Total revenues increased approximately $229.1 million to $652.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 from $423.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from services and fees of $182.9 million, an increase in revenue from interest income loans and securities lending of $38.9 million and increase in revenue from sale of goods of $7.3 million. The increase in revenue from services and fees of $182.9 million in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in revenue of $171.8 million in the Capital Markets segment, $0.1 million in the Valuation and Appraisal segment, $43.5 million in the Principal Investments United Online and magicJack segment and $4.1 million in the Brands segment, partially offset by a decrease of $36.6 million in the Auction and Liquidation segment,. Revenues from services and fees in the Capital Markets segment increased approximately $171.8 million, to $408.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 from $236.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in revenue of $115.0 million from trading gains, an increase in revenue of $24.8 million from consulting fees primarily as a result of the acquisition of GlassRatner on August 1, 2018, an increase in investment banking fees of $24.2 million and an increase in asset management fees and carried interest of $10.3 million. The $115.0 million increase in trading gains includes realized and unrealized amounts earned on investments made in our proprietary trading account. Investments made in our proprietary trading account has increased from $273.6 million at December 31, 2018 to $451.6 million at December 31, 2019. Revenues from services and fees in the Auction and Liquidation segment decreased $36.6 million, to $18.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 from $54.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in revenues of $36.6 million was primarily due to a decrease in revenues of $31.8 million from services and fees related to retail liquidation engagements and a decrease in revenues of $2.5 million from services and fees in our wholesale and industrial auction division. The $31.8 million decrease in revenues from retail liquidation engagements was caused by a retail engagement loss incurred for a contract entered into during the fourth quarter of 2019 to liquidate the assets of a retailer where the funds advanced exceed the expected recovery. Revenues from services and fees in the Valuation and Appraisal segment increased $0.1 million, to $38.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 from $38.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenues in the Valuation and Appraisal segment is primarily due to an increase in revenues for appraisal engagements where we perform valuations for the monitoring of collateral for financial institutions, lenders, and private equity investors. Revenues from services and fees in the Principal Investments - United Online and magicJack segment increased $43.5 million to $97.1 million year ended December 31, 2019 from $53.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenues from services and fees is a result of the acquisition of magicJack on November 14, 2018 in the segment for the full year ended December 31, 2019 which increased revenue $53.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in services and fees revenue from UOL of $9.8 million. Management expects revenues from UOL continue to decline year over year. The primary source of revenue included in this segment is subscription services revenue and some advertising and other revenues. 59 Revenues from services and fees in the Brands segment were $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We established the Brands segment in 2019 following the acquisition of a majority interest in BR Brands on October 28, 2019. The primary source of revenue included in this segment is the licensing of trademarks.

Interest income from loans was $34.6 million and $6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in interest income on loans was primarily due to the increase in lending activities in our Capital Markets segment which included an increase in loans receivable to $225.8 million at December 31, 2019 from $38.8 million at December 31, 2018.

The increase in revenues from sale of goods were primarily attributable to $4.2 million of goods sold as part of our retail liquidation engagements and $3.1 million of sales of magicJack devices that are sold in connection with VoIP services and, to a lesser extent, sale of mobile broadband devices from UOL that are sold in connection with the mobile broadband services.

During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we generated net income attributable to the Company of $81.6 million and $15.5 million, respectively. Our cash flows and profitability are impacted by the number and size of retail liquidation and capital markets engagements performed on a quarterly and annual basis. As of December 31, 2019, we had $104.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, $0.5 million of restricted cash, $451.6 million of securities and other investments held at fair value, $225.8 million of loans receivable, and $814.9 million of borrowings outstanding.

We continue to monitor our financial performance to ensure sufficient liquidity to fund operations and execute on our business plan. 67 Cash Flow Summary Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (Dollars in thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ (30,392 ) $ (104,814 ) $ (81,790 ) Investing activities (295,396 ) (151,441 ) (17,836 ) Financing activities 250,176 284,859 134,094 Effect of foreign currency on cash 73 (860 ) 2,667 Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (75,539 ) $ 27,744 $ 37,135 Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018 Cash used in operating activities was $30.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to cash used in operating activities of $104.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Credit Agreements On April 21, 2017, we amended the asset based credit facility agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement ) with Wells Fargo Bank to increase the maximum borrowing limit from $100.0 million to $200.0 million. Such amendment, among other things, also extended the expiration date of the credit facility from July 15, 2018 to April 21, 2022. The Credit Agreement continues to allow for borrowings under a separate credit agreement (a UK Credit Agreement ) dated March 19, 2015 with an affiliate of Wells Fargo Bank which provides for the financing of transactions in the United Kingdom with borrowings up to 50.0 million British Pounds. Any borrowing on the UK Credit Agreement reduces the availability of the asset based $200.0 million credit facility. The UK Credit Agreement is cross collateralized and integrated in certain respects with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement continues to include the addition of our Canadian subsidiary, from the October 5, 2016 amendment to the Credit Agreement, to facilitate borrowings to fund retail liquidation transactions in Canada. From time to time, we utilize this credit facility to fund costs and expenses incurred in connection with liquidation engagements. We also utilize this credit facility in order to issue letters of credit in connection with liquidation engagements conducted on a guaranteed basis. Subject to certain limitations and offsets, we are permitted to borrow up to $200.0 million under the credit facility, less the aggregate principal amount borrowed under the UK Credit Agreement (if in effect). Borrowings under the credit facility are only made at the discretion of the lender and are generally required to be repaid within 180 days. The interest rate for each revolving credit advance under the related credit agreement is, subject to certain terms and conditions, equal to the LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% to 3.25% depending on the type of advance and the percentage such advance represents of the related transaction for which such advance is provided. The credit facility is secured by the proceeds received for services rendered in connection with the liquidation service contracts pursuant to which any outstanding loan or letters of credit are issued and the assets that are sold at liquidation related to such contract, if any. The credit facility also provides for success fees in the amount of 2.5% to 17.5% of the net profits, if any, earned on liquidation engagements that are financed under the credit facility as set forth in the related credit agreement. We typically seek borrowings on an engagement-by-engagement basis. The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets, make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. The outstanding balance on this credit facility was $37.1 million and $0 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2019, there were no letters of credit outstanding under this credit facility.

The declaration and payment of any future dividends or repurchases of our common stock will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, capital expenditures, and other factors that may be deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. 72 A summary of dividend activity for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was as follows: Regular Special Total Stockholder Dividend Dividend Dividend Date Declared Date Paid Record Date Amount Amount Amount October 30, 2019 November 26, 2019 November 14, 2019 $ 0.175 $ 0.475 $ 0.650 August 1, 2019 August 29, 2019 August 15, 2019 0.175 0.325 0.500 May 1, 2019 May 29, 2019 May 15, 2019 0.08 0.18 0.26 March 5, 2019 March 26, 2019 March 19, 2019 0.08 0.00 0.08 November 5, 2018 November 27, 2018 November 16, 2018 0.08 0.08 0.16 August 2, 2018 August 29, 2018 August 16, 2018 0.08 0.22 0.30 May 7, 2018 June 5, 2018 May 21, 2018 0.08 0.04 0.12 March 7, 2018 April 3, 2018 March 20, 2018 0.08 0.08 0.16 Holders of Series A Preferred Stock, when and as authorized by the board of directors of the Company, are entitled to cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 6.875% per annum of the $25,000 liquidation preference ($25.00 per Depositary Share) per year (equivalent to $1,718.75 or $1.71875 per Depositary Share). Dividends will be payable quarterly in arrears, on or about the last day of January, April, July and October. On October 15, 2019, the Company declared a cash dividend representing $0.11458333 per Depositary Share. The dividend was paid on October 31, 2019 to holders of record as of the close of business on October 21, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, dividends in arrears in respect of the Depositary Shares were $673. On January 9, 2020, the Company declared a cash dividend $0.4296875 per Depositary Share, which was paid on January 31, 2019 to holders of record as of the close of business on January 21, 2019. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 and the periods in which payments are due: Payments due by period Total Less Than One Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 years (Dollars in thousands) Contractual Obligations Operating lease obligations $ 75,885 $ 12,646 $ 20,634 $ 17,886 $ 24,719 Notes payable 38,255 37,509 746 Term loan 64,597 19,270 36,592 8,735 Senior notes payable, including interest 984,832 49,117 98,234 409,265 428,216 Total $ 1,163,569 $ 118,542 $ 156,206 $ 435,886 $ 452,935 We anticipate that cash generated from operations and existing borrowing arrangements under our credit facility to fund costs and expenses incurred in connection with liquidation engagements should be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the success of our businesses in generating cash from operations, continued compliance with financial covenants contained in our credit facility, the timing of principal payments on our long-term debt and the Capital Markets in general, among other factors. 73 Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements and the notes thereto contain information that is pertinent to management discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. On a continual basis, management reviews its estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such reviews, and if deemed appropriate, management estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different and/or future circumstances. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and changes in the estimate, or the use of different estimating methods that could have been selected, could have a material impact on results of operations or financial condition. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as valuation of securities, reserves for accounts receivable, the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill, the fair value of mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests, accounting for income tax valuation allowances, recovery of contract assets and sales returns and allowances. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements. Revenue Recognition. On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method and the impact was determined to be immaterial on our consolidated financial statements. The new revenue standard was applied prospectively in our consolidated financial statements from January 1, 2018 forward and reported financial information for historical comparable periods will not be revised and will continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect during those historical periods. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or performance obligations for services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services. Revenues from contracts with customers in the Capital Markets segment, Auction and Liquidation segment, Valuation and Appraisal segment, Principal Investments United Online and magicJack segment and Brands segment are primarily comprised of the following: Capital Markets Segment - Fees earned from corporate finance and investment banking services are derived from debt, equity and convertible securities offerings in which the Company acted as an underwriter or placement agent. Fees from underwriting activities are recognized as revenues when the performance obligation for the services related to the underwriting transaction is satisfied under the terms of the engagement and is not subject to any other contingencies. Fees are also earned from financial advisory and consulting services rendered in connection with client mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, recapitalizations and other strategic transactions. The performance obligation for financial advisory services is satisfied over time as work progresses on the engagement and services are delivered to the client. The performance obligation for financial advisory services may also include success and performance based fees which are recognized as revenue when the performance obligation is no longer constrained and it is not probable that the revenue recognized would be subject to significant reversal in a future period. Generally, it is probable that the revenue recognized is no longer subject to significant reversal upon the closing of the investment banking transaction. Fees from wealth and asset management services consist primarily of investment management fees that are recognized over the period the performance obligation for the services are provided. Investment management fees are primarily comprised of fees for investment management services and are generally based on the dollar amount of the assets being managed. Revenues from sales and trading are recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied and include commissions resulting from equity securities transactions executed as agent or principal and are recorded on a trade date basis and fees paid for equity research. Revenues from other sources in the Capital Markets segment is primarily comprised of (i) interest income from loans receivable and securities lending activities, (ii) related net trading gains and losses from market making activities, the commitment of capital to facilitate customer orders, (iii) trading activities from our Principal Investments in equity and other securities for the Company account, and (iv) other income. 74 Interest income from securities lending activities consists of interest income from equity and fixed income securities that are borrowed from one party and loaned to another. The Company maintains relationships with a broad group of banks and broker-dealers to facilitate the sourcing, borrowing and lending of equity and fixed income securities in a matched book to limit the Company exposure to fluctuations in the market value or securities borrowed and securities loaned. Other revenues include (i) net trading gains and losses from market making activities in our fixed income group, (ii) carried interest from our asset management recognized as earnings from financial assets within the scope of ASC 323 - Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures , and therefore will not be in the scope of ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers . In accordance with ASC 323 - Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures , the Company will record equity method income (losses) as a component of investment income based on the change in our proportionate claim on net assets of the investment fund, including performance-based capital allocations, assuming the investment fund was liquidated as of each reporting date pursuant to each fund governing agreements, and (iii) other miscellaneous income Auction and Liquidation segment - Commission and fees earned on the sale of goods at Auction and Liquidation sales are recognized when evidence of a contract or arrangement exists, the transaction price has been determined, and the performance obligation has been satisfied when control of the product and risks of ownership has been transferred to the buyer. The commission and fees earned for these services are included in revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Under these types of arrangements, revenues also include contractual reimbursable costs. Revenues earned from Auction and Liquidation services contracts where the Company guarantees a minimum recovery value for goods being sold at auction or liquidation are recognized over time when the performance obligation is satisfied. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of services to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Costs to fulfill the contract include labor and other direct costs incurred by the Company related to the contract. Due to the nature of the guarantees and performance obligations under these contracts, the estimation of revenue that is ultimately earned is complex and subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. It is common for these contracts to contain provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price upon completion of our performance obligations under the contract. Estimated amounts are included in the transaction price at the most likely amount it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether or not to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance under the contract taking into consideration all historical, current and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us. Costs that directly relate to the contract and expected to be recoverable are capitalized as an asset and included in advances against customer contracts in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These costs are amortized as the services are transferred to the customer over the contract period, which generally does not exceed six months, and the expense is recognized as a component of direct cost of services. If, during the auction or liquidation sale, the Company determines that the total costs to be incurred on a performance obligation under a contract exceeds the total estimated revenues to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the performance obligation is recognized in the period the loss is determined. If the Company determines that the variable consideration used in the initial determination of the transaction price for the contract is such that the total recoveries from the auction or liquidation will not exceed the guaranteed recovery values or advances made in accordance with the contract, the transaction price will be reduced and a loss or negative revenue could result from the performance obligation. A provision for the entire loss as negative revenue on the performance obligation is recognized in the period the loss is determined. Valuation and Appraisal Segment - Revenues in the Valuation and Appraisal segment are primarily comprised of fees for Valuation and Appraisal services. Revenues are recognized when the performance obligation is completed and is generally at the point in time upon delivery of the report to the customer. Revenues in the Valuation and Appraisal segment also include contractual reimbursable costs. Principal Investments United Online and magicJack Segment Revenues in the Principal Investments - United Online and magicJack segment are primarily comprised of services revenue from fees charged to United Online pay accounts; sales revenue from the sale of the magicJack and related devices and access rights; revenues from access rights renewals and mobile apps; prepaid minutes revenues; revenues from access and wholesale charges; service revenue from UCaaS hosting services; advertising and other revenues; and products revenues from the sale of magicJack and mobile broadband service devices, including the related shipping and handling and installation fees, if applicable. Service revenues from fees charged to United Online pay accounts are recognized in the period in which fees are fixed or determinable and the related services are provided to the customer. The Company pay accounts generally pay in advance for their services by credit card, PayPal, automated clearinghouse or check, and revenues are then recognized ratably over the service period. Advance payments from pay accounts are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue. In circumstances where payment is not received in advance, revenues are only recognized if collectability is probably. 75 Revenues from sales of the magicJack devices and access rights represent revenues recognized from sales of the magicJack devices to retailers, wholesalers, or direct to customers, net of returns, over the period associated with the access right period. Revenues for the device and initial access right were accounted for as a combined unit of accounting and recognized ratably over the service term. The transaction price for magicJack devices is allocated between equipment and service based on stand-alone selling prices. Revenues allocated to equipment are recognized upon delivery (when control transfers to the customer), and service revenue is recognized ratably over the service term. The Company estimates the return of direct sales as part of the transaction price using a six month rolling average of historical returns. Revenues for hardware and shipping are recognized at the time of delivery and revenues for services are recognized ratably over the service. The Company recognizes revenue for hardware based on delivery terms to the retailer and revenue for service is deferred for the delay period and recognized ratably over the remaining access right period. Revenues from access rights renewals and mobile apps represents revenues from customers purchasing rights to access our servers beyond the access right period included in a magicJack device or magicJack service. The extended access right ranges from one to five years. These fees charged to customers are initially deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the extended access right period. Revenues from access rights granted to users of the magicApp, magicJack Connect App and magicJack Spark are recognized ratably over the access right period. Revenues from the sale of other magicJack related products are revenues recognized from the sale of other items related to the magicJack devices and access right renewals the Company offers its customers, including porting fees charged to customers to port their existing phone number to a magicJack device or services, fees charged for customer to select a custom, vanity or Canadian phone number and fees charged to customers to change their existing number. These revenues are recognized at the time of sale. Prepaid minutes revenues are primarily from the usage and expiration of international prepaid minutes, net of chargebacks. Revenues from prepaid minutes are recognized as minutes are used. Revenues from access and wholesale charges are generated from access fees charged to other telecommunication carriers or providers for Interexchange Carriers ( IXC ) calls terminated to the Company end-users, and other fees charged to telecommunication carriers or providers for origination of calls to their 800-numbers. These revenues are recorded based on rates set forth in the respective state and federal tariffs or negotiated contract rates, less provisions for billing adjustments. Revenues from access and wholesale charges are recognized as calls are terminated to the network. UCaaS revenues are recurring monthly service revenue from sales of its hosted services. Customers are billed monthly in advance for these recurring services and in arrears for one time service charges and other certain usage charges. UCaaS revenues also includes non-recurring revenue from the sale of hardware and network equipment. Revenues for recurring monthly service are recorded in the period the services are provided over the term of the respective customer agreements and revenue from the sale of hardware and network equipment is recognized in the period that the equipment is delivered and put into service. Advertising revenues consist primarily of amounts from the Company Internet search partner that are generated as a result of users utilizing the partner Internet search services and amounts generated from display advertisements. The Company recognizes such advertising revenues in the period in which the advertisement is displayed or, for performance-based arrangements, when the related performance criteria are met. In determining whether an arrangement exists, the Company ensures that a written contract is in place, such as a standard insertion order or a customer-specific agreement. The Company assesses whether performance criteria have been met and whether the fees are fixed or determinable based on a reconciliation of the performance criteria and the payment terms associated with the transaction. Brands Segment Revenues are derived from various license agreements that provide revenue based on guaranteed minimum royalty payments and advertising/marketing fees with additional royalty revenue based on a percentage of defined sales. Guaranteed minimum royalty payments and advertising/marketing revenue are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of each contract year, as defined in each license agreement. Royalty payments exceeding the guaranteed minimum amounts are recognized as income during the period corresponding to the licensee sales. Additionally, payments received for terminating licenses are recognized when termination agreements are entered into and collectability is probable. Payments received as consideration for the grant of a license are recorded as deferred revenue at the time payment is received and recognized ratably as revenue over the term of the license agreement. Advanced royalty payments are recorded as deferred revenue at the time payment is received and recognized as revenue when earned. Revenue is not recognized unless collectability is probable. 76 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses inherent in our accounts receivable portfolio. In establishing the required allowance, management utilizes a specific customer identification methodology. Management also considers historical losses adjusted for current market conditions and the customers financial condition, the amount of receivables in dispute, and the current receivables aging and current payment patterns. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The bad debt expense is included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance which requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. Goodwill includes the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and the acquisition of noncontrolling interests. The Codification requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment). Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value. The Company operates five reporting units, which are the same as its reporting segments described in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of reporting units which includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may assess qualitative factors for some or all of our reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Alternatively, we may bypass this qualitative assessment for some or all of our reporting units and perform a detailed quantitative test of impairment (step 1). If we perform the detailed qualitative impairment test and the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would perform an analysis (step 2) to measure such impairment. In 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill balances for each of our reporting units in performing our annual impairment test and concluded that the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and no impairments were identified. In accordance with the Codification, the Company reviews the carrying value of its intangibles, which is comprised of tradenames and customer lists, and other long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows of such assets are less than the carrying amount, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, if any, exceeds its fair market value. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized no impairment of intangibles. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized impairment of intangibles in the amount of $1.1 million related to the tradename of Wunderlich Securities, Inc. In June 2018, the Company changed the name Wunderlich Securities, Inc. to B. Riley Wealth Management, Inc. This impairment charge is included in restructuring charge in our consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements. The Company records securities and other investments owned, securities sold not yet purchased, and mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests that were issued after November 5, 2003 at fair value with fair value determined in accordance with the Codification. Our mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the three levels of fair value hierarchy. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments that are highly liquid, observable and actively traded in over-the-counter markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable and can be corroborated by market data. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The fair value of mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests is determined based on the issuance of similar interests for cash, references to industry comparables, and relied, in part, on information obtained from appraisal reports and internal valuation models. 77 Investments in partnership interests include investments in private equity partnerships that primarily invest in equity securities, bonds, and direct lending funds. We also invest in priority investment funds and the underlying securities held by these funds are primarily corporate and asset-backed fixed income securities and restrictions exist on the redemption of amounts invested by the Company. The Company partnership and investment fund interests are valued based on the Company proportionate share of the net assets of the partnerships and funds; the value for these investments are derived from the most recent statements received from the general partner or fund administrator. These partnership and investment fund interests are valued at net asset value ( NAV ) in accordance with ASC Topic 820: Fair Value Measurements . The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate fair value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amounts of the notes payable (including credit lines used to finance liquidation engagements), long-term debt and capital lease obligations approximate fair value because the contractual interest rates or effective yields of such instruments are consistent with current market rates of interest for instruments of comparable credit risk. Share-Based Compensation. The Company share based payment awards principally consist of grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units. Share based payment awards also include grants of membership interests in the Company majority owned subsidiaries. The grants of membership interests consist of percentage interests in the Company majority owned subsidiaries as determined at the date of grant. In accordance with the accounting guidance share based payment awards are classified as either equity or a liability. For equity-classified awards, the Company measures compensation cost for the grant of membership interests at fair value on the date of grant and recognizes compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service or performance period the award is expected to vest. The fair value of the liability-classified award will be subsequently remeasured at each reporting date through the settlement date. Change in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period. In June 2018, the Company adopted the 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( Purchase Plan ) which allows eligible employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price that is 85% of the market value of the common stock on the last day of the offering period. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ( ASC 718 ), the Company is required to recognize compensation expense relating to shares offered under the Purchase Plan. Income Taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company estimates the degree to which tax assets and credit carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, the eligible carryforward period, and other circumstances. A valuation allowance for such tax assets and loss carryforwards is provided when it is determined to be more likely than not that the benefit of such deferred tax asset will not be realized in future periods. Tax benefits of operating loss carryforwards are evaluated on an ongoing basis, including a review of historical and projected future operating results, the eligible carryforward period, and other circumstances. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, the related valuation allowance on such assets would be reduced. The Company establishes a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Tax benefits of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are evaluated on an ongoing basis, including a review of historical and projected future operating results, the eligible carryforward period, and other circumstances. As a result of the common stock offering that was completed on June 5, 2014, the Company had a more than 50% ownership shift in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Accordingly, the Company is limited to the amount of net operating loss that may be utilized in future taxable years depending on the Company actual taxable income. As of December 31, 2019, the Company believes that the net operating loss that existed as of the more than 50% ownership shift will be utilized in future tax periods and it is more-likely-than-not that future taxable earnings will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets and has not provided an allowance.
