See Overview Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated. All dollar amounts in the following discussion are in millions of United States ( U.S. ) dollars, unless otherwise indicated. OVERVIEW We are a global beauty company. We manufacture, market, sell and distribute branded beauty products, including fragrances, color cosmetics, hair care products and skin & body related products throughout the world. Operating and Reportable Segments Our business is organized into three divisions: Luxury, Consumer Beauty and Professional Beauty, and our operating and reportable segments reflect this divisional structure. Certain shared costs and the results of corporate initiatives are managed outside of our three segments by Corporate. Our organizational structure is product category focused, putting the consumer first, by specifically targeting how and where they shop and what and why they purchase. Each division has full end-to-end responsibility to optimize the consumers beauty experiences in their relevant categories and channels in this new organizational design and translate this into profitable growth. The operating and reportable segments are: Luxury primarily focused on prestige fragrances, premium skin care and premium cosmetics; Consumer Beauty primarily focused on color cosmetics, retail hair coloring and styling products, mass fragrance, mass skin care and body care; 28 Professional Beauty primarily focused on hair and nail care products for professionals. Geographic Structure We have determined our geographic regions to be North America (Canada and the U.S.), Europe and ALMEA (Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and Australia). Overview We are one of the world largest beauty companies, with an iconic portfolio of brands across fragrance, color cosmetics, hair color and styling, and skin and body care. We are the global leader in fragrance, a strong number two in professional hair color & styling, and number three in color cosmetics. The transformational acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business and our other strategic transactions have strengthened and diversified our presence across the countries, categories and channels in which we compete, building a strong beauty platform. Our products are sold in more than 150 countries around the world. Certain product categories and geographies in which we compete continue to grow moderately. This includes mid single digit growth in the luxury fragrance category and low single digit decline in the mass beauty category driven by declines in North America and Europe. Additionally, in certain categories, our revenues are declining faster than the category which continue to negatively impact our business and financial results. The economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact the timing of our sales and operating performance each period. In addition, as product life cycles shorten, results are driven primarily by successfully developing, introducing and marketing new, innovative products. Fiscal 2019 results Despite strong consumer demand and innovation in the Luxury and Professional Beauty divisions, results in fiscal 2019 reflected the impact of supply chain disruptions on all divisions, arising from our supply chain footprint transformation (the Supply Chain Disruptions ). The deterioration in Consumer Beauty results were further impacted by the continued weakness in U.S. and Europe mass beauty categories, and the continued impact from distribution losses, primarily in the U.S. We have resolved the supply chain issues, and they had minimal impact on our results during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2019 milestones and Turnaround Plan Our top priority is taking the necessary steps to stabilize our consumer business and build lasting and sustainable performance at Coty. In fiscal 2019, we completed the last steps of the complex integration of the P&G Beauty Business, including our one order, one invoice, one shipment integration program which enables us to sell, ship and invoice our brands in a more efficient way for our customers. We also completed the transformation of our supply chain footprint. Under the direction of our new senior leadership, we undertook a broad review of our business to develop a strategic framework to position us for sustainable performance and long-term success, and in July 2019, we announced a multi-year Turnaround Plan that aims to stabilize and gradually accelerate revenue growth, improve our profitability through gross margin growth and cost control, and deleverage our balance sheet. The priorities of the Turnaround Plan are threefold: to rediscover growth, to regain operational leadership and to build a culture of pride and performance. In connection with the Turnaround Plan, we announced organizational changes intended to align our costs with our revenue realities, simplify decision making and enable our teams in the markets to act with closer guidance and with greater speed. We expect to move from the current organizational structure into regional commercial business units for Luxury and Consumer Beauty, as well as create new regions: Americas, Asia Pacific and EMEA. Such regional business units will be supported by central Luxury and Consumer Beauty marketing teams. Professional Beauty is expected to remain a distinct business unit due to its unique salon channel focus. Our commercial front line the local sales and marketing teams facing our customers and building our brands locally will see little impact and will remain specialized in their respective products and sales channels. In order to reduce geographic fragmentation and costs, the reorganization includes the co-location of most of our executive team and corporate functions in a centralized management headquarters in Amsterdam. The reorganization is accompanied by strategies to drive substantial improvement in our Consumer Beauty business while also further optimizing our Luxury and Professional Beauty businesses. We aim to achieve this by focusing our investments in fewer brands and markets, increasing shelf productivity through improved assortment, improving mix management, and developing a stronger and margin-accretive innovation pipeline. In order to fuel both increased investment in the business (including targeted advertising and consumer promotion spend and disciplined research and development investments) as well as improved profitability, we are working to lower our cost of goods sold through improved productivity in our existing manufacturing footprint, simplifying our product range, and lowering fixed costs through a simplified organizational structure. We are also focused on increasing our cash flow and reducing our indebtedness. To implement the Turnaround Plan, we expect to incur one-time cash costs of approximately $600 million spread over fiscal years 2020 through to 2023, in addition to approximately $160 million connected to previous programs. 29 Outlook For fiscal year 2020, we expect to moderate the decline in our net revenues and target moderate improvements in cash flow and operating income, underpinned by our efforts to lower costs and improve operational execution. By fiscal year 2023, we are targeting moderate net revenue growth, significant expansion in operating income and operating margin and improvements in cash flow. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP financial measures including Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. and Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. per common share (collectively, the Adjusted Performance Measures ). The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in tables below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in the beauty industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. Despite the limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures, our management uses the Adjusted Performance Measures as key metrics in the evaluation of our performance and annual budgets and to benchmark performance of our business against our competitors. The following are examples of how these Adjusted Performance Measures are utilized by our management: strategic plans and annual budgets are prepared using the Adjusted Performance Measures; senior management receives a monthly analysis comparing budget to actual operating results that is prepared using the Adjusted Performance Measures; and senior management annual compensation is calculated, in part, by using the Adjusted Performance Measures. In addition, our financial covenant compliance calculations under our debt agreements are substantially derived from these Adjusted Performance Measures. Our management believes that Adjusted Performance Measures are useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of the Company. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures address questions we routinely receive from analysts and investors and, in order to ensure that all investors have access to the same data, our management has determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. The Adjusted Performance Measures exclude the impact of certain items (as further described below) and provide supplemental information regarding our operating performance. By disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures, our management intends to provide investors with a supplemental comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented. Our management believes these measures are also useful to investors as such measures allow investors to evaluate our performance using the same metrics that our management uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance. We provide disclosure of the effects of these non-GAAP financial measures by presenting the corresponding measure prepared in conformity with GAAP in our financial statements, and by providing a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure so that investors may understand the adjustments made in arriving at the non-GAAP financial measures and use the information to perform their own analyses. Adjusted operating income excludes restructuring costs and business structure realignment programs, amortization, acquisition-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts, asset impairment charges and other adjustments as described below. We do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period-to-period in terms of size, nature and significance. They are primarily incurred to realign our operating structure and integrate new acquisitions, and fluctuate based on specific facts and circumstances. Additionally, Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. and Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. per common share are adjusted for certain interest and other (income) expense as described below and the related tax effects of each of the items used to derive Adjusted net income as such charges are not used by our management in assessing our operating performance period-to-period. Adjusted Performance Measures reflect adjustments based on the following items: Costs related to acquisition activities: We have excluded acquisition-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts such as those related to transaction costs and costs associated with the revaluation of acquired inventory in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction. The nature and amount of such costs vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Also, the size, complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions, which often drives the magnitude of such expenses, may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of any future acquisitions. 30 Restructuring and other business realignment costs: We have excluded costs associated with restructuring and business structure realignment programs to allow for comparable financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance. In addition, the nature and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures, our management is able to further evaluate our ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. Amortization expense: We have excluded the impact of amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. Although we exclude amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP expenses, our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets. Asset impairment charges: We have excluded the impact of asset impairments as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. Loss/(Gain) on sale of brand assets: We have excluded the impact of Loss/(gain) on sale of brand assets as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the size of divestitures. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. Interest (income) expense: We have excluded foreign currency impacts associated with acquisition-related and debt financing-related forward contracts, as well as debt financing transaction costs as the nature and amount of such charges are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of such transactions. Other expense (income): We have excluded the impact of costs incurred for legal and advisory services rendered in connection with the evaluation of the tender offer initiated by certain of our shareholders. Our management believes these costs do not reflect our underlying ongoing business, and the adjustment of such costs helps investors and others compare and analyze performance from period to period. We have also excluded the impact of pension curtailment (gains) and losses and pension settlements as such events are triggered by our restructuring and other business realignment activities and the amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. Loss on early extinguishment of debt: We have excluded loss on extinguishment of debt as this represents a non-cash charge, and the amount and frequency of such charges is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt financing transactions. Noncontrolling interest: This adjustment represents the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments included in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests based on the relevant non-controlling interest percentage. Tax: This adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pretax items excluded from Adjusted net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments are based on the tax rates related to the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are received or incurred. While acquiring brands and licenses comprises a part of our overall growth strategy, along with targeting organic growth opportunities, we have excluded acquisition-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and the amount and frequency are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Our management assesses the success of an acquisition as a component of performance using a variety of indicators depending on the size and nature of the acquisition, including: the scale of the combined company by evaluating consolidated and segment financial metrics; the expansion of product offerings by evaluating segment, brand, and geographic performance and the respective strength of the brands; the evaluation of market share expansion in categories and geographies; the earnings per share accretion and substantial incremental free cash flow generation providing financial flexibility for us; and 31 the comparison of actual and projected results, including achievement of projected synergies, post integration; provided that timing for any such comparison will depend on the size and complexity of the acquisition. Constant Currency We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net revenues generated outside of the U.S. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations. Therefore, to supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, certain financial information is presented in constant currency , excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We calculate constant currency information by translating current and prior-period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars into U.S. dollars using prior year foreign currency exchange rates. The constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency that is different to the functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate. The constant currency information we present may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 32 Basis of Presentation of Acquisitions and Divestitures During the period when we complete an acquisition, divestiture or early license termination, the financial results of the current year period are not comparable to the financial results presented in the prior year period. When explaining such changes from period to period and to maintain a consistent basis between periods, we exclude the financial contribution of: (i) the acquired brands or businesses in the current year period until we have twelve months of comparable financial results and (ii) the divested brands or businesses or early terminated brands in the prior year period, to maintain comparable financial results with the current fiscal year period. Acquisitions, divestitures and early license terminations that would impact the comparability of financial results between periods presented in the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are shown in the table below. Period of acquisition, divestiture, or termination Acquisition, divestiture, or termination Impact on basis of 2019/2018 presentation Impact on basis of 2018/2017 presentation First quarter fiscal 2017 n/a n/a n/a Second quarter fiscal 2017 Acquisition : P&G Beauty Business (all segments) Ghd (Professional segment) n/a First quarter of fiscal 2018 P&G financial contribution excluded and five months of fiscal 2018 ghd financial contribution excluded Third quarter fiscal 2017 Acquisitions : Younique (Consumer Beauty segment) n/a Seven months of fiscal 2018 financial contribution excluded Fourth quarter fiscal 2017 n/a n/a n/a First quarter fiscal 2018 n/a n/a n/a Second quarter fiscal 2018 Acquisition : Burberry Beauty Business (Luxury segment) First quarter fiscal 2019 financial contribution excluded Second, third, and fourth quarter fiscal 2018 financial contribution excluded Third quarter fiscal 2018 Termination : Guess (Consumer Beauty segment) First, second and third quarter fiscal 2018 financial contribution excluded n/a Fourth quarter fiscal 2018 Divestitures of licenses : Playboy (Consumer Beauty segment) and Cerruti (Luxury segment) First, second, third and fourth quarter fiscal 2018 financial contribution excluded n/a When used herein, the term Acquisitions and Divestitures refer to the financial contributions of the related acquisitions or divestitures and early license terminations shown above, during the period that is not comparable as a result of such acquisitions or divestitures and early license terminations. A detailed discussion of the fiscal 2018 year-over-year changes can be found in Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on August 21, 2018. NET REVENUES In fiscal 2019 , net revenues decreased 8% , or $749.5 , to $8,648.5 from $9,398.0 in fiscal 2018 . The impact of the acquisition of the Burberry Beauty Business had a positive contribution of 1% to the total change in net revenues in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. This was more than offset by the impact of the termination of the Guess license and the divestitures of the licenses of Playboy and Cerruti , which had a negative impact of 2% on the total change in net revenues in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 . Excluding the impacts of the Acquisitions and Divestitures, total net revenues in fiscal 2019 decreased 7% , or $657.3 , to $8,586.2 from $9,243.5 in fiscal 2018 , reflecting a negative foreign currency exchange translation impact of 3% and a decrease in unit volume of 4% . The d ecrease in net revenues primarily reflects: (i) Shelf-space losses primarily impacting CoverGirl, Rimmel and Clairol which have contributed to the negative share trends in the color cosmetics and hair color categories in North America; (ii) Performance challenges in our brands across Europe which have contributed to the region negative share trends in the color cosmetics category; (iii) Moderate weakness in the mass beauty categories in North American and Europe; and 33 (iv) The Supply Chain Disruptions, which negatively impacted net revenues primarily in the first half of 2019 and were resolved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Net Revenues by Segment Year Ended June 30, Change % (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 2019/2018 2018/2017 NET REVENUES Luxury $ 3,294.3 $ 3,210.5 $ 2,566.6 3 % 25 % Consumer Beauty 3,539.3 4,268.1 3,688.2 (17 %) 16 % Professional Beauty 1,814.9 1,919.4 1,395.5 (5 %) 38 % Total $ 8,648.5 $ 9,398.0 $ 7,650.3 (8 %) 23 % Luxury In fiscal 2019 , net revenues from the Luxury segment increased 3% , or $83.8 to $3,294.3 from $3,210.5 in fiscal 2018 . The impact of the acquisition of the Burberry Beauty Business had a positive contribution of 2% on the total change in net revenues for the segment in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 . This was partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of the license of Cerruti , which had a negative contribution of 1% on the total change in net revenues for the segment in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 . Excluding the impacts of the Acquisitions and Divestitures, net revenues from the Luxury segment increased 2% , or $50.8 , to $3,232.0 in fiscal 2019 from $3,181.2 in fiscal 2018 , reflecting an increase in unit volume of 7% , offset by a negative foreign currency exchange translation impact of 3% and a negative price and mix impact of 2% . This increase in net revenues primarily reflects: (i) increased net revenues from Burberry due to the integration and growth of the brand since the acquisition of the Burberry Beauty Business in the second quarter of fiscal 2018; (ii) increased net revenues from Calvin Klein due to the continued success from the launch of Calvin Klein Women in the first quarter of fiscal 2019; and (iii) increased net revenues from Gucci due to a number of successful launches in fiscal 2019 including Gucci Bloom Nettare di Fiori, Gucci Guilty Pour Femme, Gucci Alchemist Garden and the relaunch of Gucci Make-up . These increases were partially offset by a net revenue decline in (i) Hugo Boss due to the Supply Chain Disruptions primarily during the first half of fiscal 2019; (ii) lower net revenues from philosophy due to reduced promotional activities with a key U.S. customer and due to the timing of shipments; and (iii) the negative impact of foreign currency exchange translation. Consumer Beauty In fiscal 2019 , net revenues from the Consumer Beauty segment decreased 17% , or $728.8 , to $3,539.3 from $4,268.1 in fiscal 2018 . The impact of the termination of Guess and the divestiture of the license of Playboy had a negative contribution of 2% on the total change in net revenues for the segment in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 . Excluding the impact of the Divestitures, net revenues from the Consumer Beauty segment decreased 15% , or $603.6 , to $3,539.3 in fiscal 2019 from $4,142.9 in fiscal 2018 , primarily reflecting a negative price and mix impact of 6% , a decrease in unit volume of 5% , and a negative foreign currency exchange translation impact of 4% . The decrease in net revenues primarily reflects: (i) Shelf-space losses primarily impacting CoverGirl , Rimmel and Clairol which have contributed to the negative share trends in the color cosmetics and hair color categories in North America; (ii) Performance challenges in our brands across Europe which have contributed to the region negative share trends in the color cosmetics category; (iii) Moderate weakness in the mass beauty categories in North America and Europe; (iv) The Supply Chain Disruptions which resulted in lower net revenues primarily in the first half of the year mainly in the color cosmetics category, namely the Rimmel , Max Factor and Bourjois brands; (v) Reduced net revenues from Younique due to a decline in presenter sponsorship; and (vi) The negative impact of foreign currency exchange translation. These net revenue declines were partially offset by increased net revenue from Monange supported by continued share gains in Brazil. The negative price and mix impact for the segment primarily reflects this higher volume from Monange and the remainder of the body care category which has relatively lower-priced products. 34 Professional Beauty In fiscal 2019 , net revenues from the Professional Beauty segment decreased 5% , or $104.5 , to $1,814.9 from $1,919.4 in fiscal 2018 primarily reflecting a decrease in unit volume of 6% and a negative foreign currency exchange translation impact of 3% , partially offset by a positive price and mix impact of 4% . The decrease in this segment primarily reflects: (i) decreased volume for hair care brands due to lower shipments to optimize retailer trade inventory levels for certain key U.S. customers; (ii) lower net revenues due to the Supply Chain Disruptions mainly impacting OPI and brands across the hair care category in the first half of fiscal 2019; and (iii) the negative impact of foreign currency exchange translation. These decreases were partially offset by: (i) a net revenue increase in ghd due to the product launch of the ghd Glide in the third quarter and continued innovation and success from the launch of Platinum+ ; and (ii) favorable price and mix impacts from the Wella Koleston Perfect ME+ product restage in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Net Revenues by Geographic Regions In addition to our reporting segments, net revenues by geographic regions are as follows. Year Ended June 30, Change % (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 2019/2018 2018/2017 NET REVENUES North America $ 2,656.5 $ 2,966.0 $ 2,506.9 (10 %) 18 % Europe 3,777.8 4,201.6 3,325.7 (10 %) 26 % ALMEA 2,214.2 2,230.4 1,817.7 (1 %) 23 % Total $ 8,648.5 $ 9,398.0 $ 7,650.3 (8 %) 23 % North America In fiscal 2019 , net revenues in North America decreased 10% or $309.5 , to $2,656.5 from $2,966.0 in fiscal 2018 . Excluding the impacts of the Acquisition and Divestitures, net revenues in North America decreased 10% or $304.3 , to $2,641.9 in fiscal 2019 from $2,946.2 in fiscal 2018 , primarily due to: (i) shelf-space losses in the United States primarily impacting CoverGirl , Rimmel and Clairol , which have contributed to the negative share trends in the color cosmetics and hair color categories in North America; (ii) reduced net revenues in the United States from the Supply Chain Disruptions primarily in the first half of fiscal 2019; (iii) reduced net revenues from Younique due to a decline in presenter sponsorship; (iv) decreased volume for Professional hair care brands due to lower shipments to optimize retailer trade inventory levels for certain key U.S. customers; and (v) lower net revenues from philosophy due to distribution losses at a key U.S. customer and due to the timing of shipments. These decreases were partially offset by increased net revenues from Burberry in the United States due to the integration and growth of the Burberry Beauty Business. Europe In fiscal 2019 , net revenues in Europe decreased 10% , or 423.8 , to $3,777.8 from $4,201.6 in fiscal 2018 . Excluding the impacts of the Acquisition and Divestitures, net revenues in Europe decreased 9% , or 361.5 , to 3,748.8 in fiscal 2019 from 4,110.3 in fiscal 2018 , primarily due to: (i) performance challenges in our Consumer Beauty brands across Europe which have contributed to the region negative share trends in the color cosmetics category; (ii) declines in Rimmel , Bourjois , and Max Factor across the region due to the Supply Chain Disruptions primarily in the first half of fiscal 2019; (iii) declines in mass fragrances in Western Europe in part due to negative share and category trends in the mass fragrances category; and (iv) negative foreign currency exchange translation impacts. These declines were partially offset by incremental net revenues from Calvin Klein and Burberry across the region. Excluding the impact of the Acquisitions, Divestitures and the negative foreign currency exchange translation impact of 4%, net revenues in Europe decreased 5%. ALMEA In fiscal 2019 , net revenues in ALMEA decreased 1% , or $16.2 , to $2,214.2 from $2,230.4 in fiscal 2018 . Excluding the impacts of the Acquisitions and Divestitures, net revenues in ALMEA remained consistent at $2,195.5 in fiscal 2019 compared to $2,187.0 in fiscal 2018 , primarily due to (i) unfavorable foreign currency exchange translation impacts of certain currencies in Latin America; and (ii) lower net revenues in China and the Middle East from Max Factor and the retail hair line of Wella hair products due to changes to retailer trade inventory levels. These decreases were offset by (i) higher net revenues from Monange due to category growth and share gains in Brazil; (ii) increased net revenues in China from Gucci and Burberry ; and (iii) increased net revenues in South Africa from brands across the color cosmetics and prestige fragrance categories. Excluding the impact of the Acquisitions, Divestitures and the negative foreign currency exchange translation impact of 7%, net revenues in ALMEA increased 7%. 35 COST OF SALES In fiscal 2019 , cost of sales decreased 8% , or $301.3 , to $3,306.5 from $3,607.8 in fiscal 2018 . Cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 38.2% in fiscal 2019 from 38.4% in fiscal 2018 , resulting in a gross margin improvement of approximately 20 basis points, primarily reflecting: (i) a favorable mix impact associated with the increased proportion of net revenue contribution from higher-margin Luxury and Professional Beauty products in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018; (ii) lower costs from distributor terminations and accelerated depreciation of buildings and equipment associated with plant closures related to the Global Integration Activities (as defined below) in fiscal 2018; and (iii) decreased excess and obsolescence expense on inventory in the Corporate segment for artwork transition activities on acquired inventory in connection with the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business. These improvements were partially offset by: (i) increased excess and obsolescence expense on inventory within the Consumer Beauty segment; (ii) increased freight expenses, primarily reflecting higher import duties and freight rates; and (iii) the negative mix impact within the Consumer Beauty segment associated with a higher proportionate net revenue contribution from lower-margin body care products, which has its primary commercial market located in Brazil; SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES In fiscal 2019 , selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 9% , or $454.2 , to $4,563.9 from $5,018.1 in fiscal 2018 . Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 52.8% in fiscal 2019 from 53.4% in fiscal 2018 , or approximately 60 basis points. This decrease primarily reflects: (i) 150 basis points related to lower advertising and consumer promotion costs due to a rationalization of non-strategic spending in non-working media and other consumer promotion activities across all segments, a decrease in media spending within the Consumer Beauty segment due to higher investments in the prior year on the brand relaunches of CoverGirl and Clairol as well as media decreases in the current year in brands across the color cosmetics category; and (ii) 20 basis points related to lower share-based compensation expense due to significant executive forfeitures of share-based compensation instruments and the impact of actual forfeitures on the change in the estimated forfeiture rates during the period. These decreases were partially offset by: (i) 60 bas is points related to higher administrative costs due to increased depreciation expense on IT assets placed into service in conjunction with our integration activities as well as the decline in net revenues in the Consumer Beauty segment out-pacing the overall decline in administrative costs from compensation expense savings as a result of restructuring actions and certain other programs and travel & entertainment expense savings from the implementation of more stringent spending policies; and (ii) 50 basis points related to higher distribution and warehousing expenses due to a strategic shift in certain markets to distribute through subsidiaries as opposed to third-party distributors, which increases storage and handling costs and due to incremental customer penalties stemming from the Supply Chain Disruptions. OPERATING (LOSS) INCOME In fiscal 2019 , operating (loss) of ( $3,471.5 ) decreased greater than 100% , or ( $3,624.8 ), from income of $153.3 in fiscal 2018 primarily due to the asset impairment charges of $3,851.9 in fiscal 2019. Operating margin, or operating (loss) income as a percentage of net revenues, decreased to (40.1)% of net revenues in fiscal 2019 as compared to 1.6% in fiscal 2018 .

Operating margin decreased to 7.1% of net revenues in fiscal 2019 as compared to 7.7% in fiscal 2018 , primarily driven by the asset impairment charges of $122.2 in fiscal 2019. Consumer Beauty In fiscal 2019 , operating (loss) income for Consumer Beauty decreased greater than 100%, or ( $3,877.6 ), to a loss of ( $3,598.7 ) from income of $278.9 in fiscal 2018 . Operating margin decreased to less than (100%) of net revenues in fiscal 2019 as compared to 6.5% in fiscal 2018 , primarily driven by the asset impairment charges of $3,690.7 in fiscal 2019. Professional Beauty In fiscal 2019 , operating income for Professional Beauty increased 2% , or $2.7 to $122.1 from $119.4 in fiscal 2018 . Operating margin increased to 6.7% of net revenues in fiscal 2019 as compared to 6.2% in fiscal 2018 , primarily driven by lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues and lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by the asset impairment charges of $27.0 in fiscal 2019. Corporate Corporate primarily includes expenses not directly relating to our operating activities. These items are included in Corporate since we consider them to be corporate responsibilities, and these items are not used by our management to measure the underlying performance of the segments. Operating loss for Corporate was $227.7 , $493.7 and $918.6 in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , res pectively , as described under Adjusted Operating Income below. The operating loss of $227.7 in fiscal 2019 includes $12.0 million of asset impairment charges related to a Corporate investment. 37 Adjusted Operating Income by Segment We believe that adjusted operating income by segment further enhances an investor understanding of our performance.

See Reconciliation of Reported Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Coty Inc. to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Coty Inc. for the description of transactions that have been retrospectively reported outside operating income. In fiscal 2019 , adjusted operating income decreased 5% , or $52.6 , to $949.7 from $1,002.3 in fiscal 2018 . Adjusted operating margin increased to 11.0% of net revenues in fiscal 2019 as compared to 10.7% in fiscal 2018 , driven by approximately 70 basis points related to lower adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses partially offset by approximately 40 basis points related to higher adjusted costs of sales as a percentage of net revenues. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations, adjusted operating income decreased 1% . Restructuring and Other Business Realignment Costs We have in place a number of restructuring plans to improve our cost structure, including opportunities to simplify and streamline operations. In particular, in connection with the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business, we have incurred restructuring and related costs aimed at integrating and optimizing the combined organization, which we refer to as the Global Integration Activities. In addition, in 2018, we began evaluating initiatives to reduce fixed costs and enable further investment in the business, which we refer to as the 2018 Restructuring Actions. We have incurred cumulative restructuring charges of $85.2 related to approved initiatives through June 30, 2019. On July 1, 2019, we announced our Turnaround Plan. To implement the Turnaround Plan, we expect to incur restructuring and other business realignment costs, in addition to costs associated with previously announced programs. The Company expects incremental cash costs related to the Turnaround Plan to be approximately $600.0. In addition, the Company will continue to incur cash costs of $160.0 related to restructuring and other business realignment costs connected to previously announced programs. In fiscal 2019 , we incurred restructuring and other business realignment costs of $215.8 , as follows: We incurred restructuring costs of $44.2 primarily related to the Global Integration Activities and 2018 Restructuring Actions, included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations; and We incurred business structure realignment costs of $171.6 primarily related to our Global Integration Activities, and certain other programs. This amount includes $162.2 in Selling, general and administrative expenses and $9.4 in Cost of sales. In fiscal 2018 , we incurred restructuring and other business realignment costs of $391.5 , as follows: We incurred restructuring costs of $173.2 primarily related to the Global Integration Activities and 2018 Restructuring Actions, included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations; and We incurred business structure realignment costs of $218.3 primarily related to our Global Integration Activities, and certain other programs. This amount includes $167.2 in Selling, general and administrative expenses and $51.1 in Cost of sales. In all reported periods, all restructuring and other business realignment costs were reported in Corporate. 39 Amortization Expense In fiscal 2019 , amortization expense increased to $353.5 from $352.8 in fiscal 2018 . In fiscal 2019 , amortization expense of $155.3, $127.8, and $70.4 were reported in the Luxury, Consumer Beauty, and Professional Beauty segments, respectively. In fiscal 2018 , amortization expense increased to $352.8 from $275.1 in fiscal 2017 , primarily as a result of the Acquisitions. In fiscal 2018 , amortization expense of $145.1, $132.2, and $75.5 were reported in the Luxury, Consumer Beauty, and Professional Beauty segments, respectively. Costs related to acquisition activities In fiscal 2019 , we did not incur any acquisition related costs. In fiscal 2018 , we incurred $76.1 of costs related to acquisition activities. We recognized Acquisition-related costs of $64.2, primarily in connection with the acquisitions of the P&G Beauty Business, the Burberry Beauty Business, ghd and Younique. We also incurred $7.1 of cost related to acquired inventory step-up amortization in connection with the acquisitions of Younique and the Burberry Beauty Business, as well as $4.8 in excess & obsolescence expense on inventory associated with the Burberry Beauty Business acquisition, included in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In all reported periods, all acquisition-related costs were reported in Corporate, except where otherwise noted. Asset Impairment Charges In fiscal 2019, we incurred $3,851.9 of asset impairment charges primarily due to: (i) $3,690.7 related to goodwill and other intangible assets in the Consumer Beauty reporting unit recorded in fiscal 2019; (ii) $109.6 related to the philosophy trademark that is part of the Luxury reporting unit recorded in fiscal 2019; (iii) $27.0 related to the professional product line of the Wella trademark that is part of the Professional Beauty reporting unit recorded in fiscal 2019; (iii) $12.6 charge in the Luxury reporting unit during fiscal 2019 related to an acquired trademark associated with a terminated pre-existing license as a result of the acquisition; and (iv) $12.0 related to a Corporate investment recorded during fiscal 2019. For further detail as to the factors in the second and fourth quarters resulting in the asset impairment charges please refer to the Goodwill and Other Intangibles note to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In fiscal 2018, we did not incur any asset impairment charges. Loss (Gain) on sale of brand assets In fiscal 2019 , we did not incur a loss (gain) on sale of brand assets. In fiscal 2018, we sold certain assets relating to our Playboy and Cerruti fragrance brands and recorded a loss of $28.6 which has been reflected in loss (gain) on sale of brand assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET In fiscal 2019 , net interest expense was $275.7 as compared with $265.0 in fiscal 2018 . This increase is primarily a result of higher average debt balances. LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT In fiscal 2019 , we did not incur any losses related to the early extinguishment of debt. In fiscal 2018, we incurred $10.7 in losses related to the write-off of debt discount and deferred financing costs in connection with the refinancing of our credit agreement entered into on October 27, 2017 (the Coty Credit Agreement ) and the debt facilities available under the Galleria Credit Agreement (the Galleria Credit Agreement ). 40 OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET In fiscal 2019 , we incurred $30.9 of net other expense. The other expense in fiscal 2019 primarily includes $16.1 of legal and advisory services rendered in connection with the evaluation of the tender offer initiated by certain of our shareholders, $13.3 due to the change in the Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instrument ( MRFI ) balance associated with a certain Southeast Asian subsidiary and $3.8 related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the 2019 Amendment to the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement, which was partially offset by pension curtailment gains of $5.1 as a result of the Global Integration Activities, which significantly reduced the expected years of future service for employees participating in our non-U.S. pension plans. In fiscal 2018 , we incurred $30.1 of net other expense. The other expense in fiscal 2018 primarily includes $24.1 in expense related to third-party debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the refinancing of the Coty Credit Agreement and Galleria Credit Agreement and $12.5 related to the change in the MRFI balance primarily associated with a certain Southeast Asian subsidiary. These other expense charges were partially offset by a $10.4 curtailment gain triggered by an amendment to a non-U.S. postretirement healthcare plan during fiscal 2018, which significantly reduced the expected years of future service for employees participating in the plan. INCOME TAXES The following table presents our (benefit) provision for income taxes, and effective tax rates for the periods presented: 2019 2018 2017 (Benefit) for income taxes $ (8.5 ) $ (24.7 ) $ (259.5 ) Effective income tax rate 0.2 % 16.2 % 39.4 % The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 0.2% as compared with 16.2% in fiscal 2018 and 39.4% in fiscal 2017 . The effective income tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes the impact of the goodwill impairment that is not tax-deductible. The effective income tax rate in fiscal 2018 includes an expense of $41.0 as a result of the Tax Act. This expense is due to the one-time deemed repatriation tax offset by a tax benefit on the revaluation of the Company deferred taxes. See Note 16 Income Taxes in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The effective rates vary from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to the effect of (i) jurisdictions with different statutory rates, (ii) adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest, (iii) non-deductible expenses, (iv) audit settlements and (v) valuation allowance changes. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates.

(b) The tax effects of each of the items included in adjusted income are calculated in a manner that results in a corresponding income tax benefit/provision for adjusted income. In preparing the calculation, each adjustment to reported income is first analyzed to determine if the adjustment has an income tax consequence. The benefit/provision for taxes is then calculated based on the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are incurred, multiplied by the respective statutory rates and offset by the increase or reversal of any valuation allowances commensurate with the non-GAAP measure of profitability. 41 (c) See Reconciliation of Reported Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Coty Inc. to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Coty Inc. The adjusted effective tax rate was 21.0% compared to 19.2% in the prior-year period. The differences were primarily due to the resolution of a foreign uncertain tax position of approximately $43.0 in the prior period. Cash paid during the years ended June 30, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , for income taxes of $110.3 , $124.6 and $90.1 represents 16.9% , 17.3% and 16.3% of Adjusted income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended, respectively. NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COTY INC. In fiscal 2019 , net loss attributable to Coty Inc. increased $3,615.4 to a loss of $3,784.2 from a loss of $168.8 in fiscal 2018 . This net loss increase primarily reflects a higher operating loss in the current year compared to operating income in the prior year. We believe that adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. provides an enhanced understanding of our performance. See Overview Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

See below for the description of transactions that have been retrospectively reported outside operating income. (a) See a description of adjustments under Adjusted Operating Income for Coty Inc. (b) In fiscal 2019, the Company incurred legal and advisory services of $16.1 rendered in connection with the evaluation of the tender offer initiated by certain of our shareholders, partially offset by pension curtailment gains of $5.1 as a result of the Global Integration Activities, which significantly reduced the expected years of future service for employees participating in our non-U.S. pension plans. In fiscal 2018, we incurred losses of $24.1 related to the expensing of third-party debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the refinancing of the Coty Credit Agreement and Galleria Credit Agreement, partially offset by pension curtailment gains of $10.4 triggered by an amendment to a non-U.S. postretirement healthcare plan during fiscal 2018, which significantly reduced the expected years of future service for employees participating in the plan. In accordance with the adoption of ASU No. 2017-07, the curtailment gains and pension settlements are a non-service component of the net periodic benefit cost and have therefore been retrospectively reported outside operating income. In fiscal 2017, we recorded pension expense of $17.5 in connection with the settlement of obligations related to the U.S. Del Laboratories, Inc. Additionally, we recorded pension curtailment gains of $2.6 for pension plans where there was a significant reduction in the expected years of future service for plan participants as a result of the Acquisition Integration Program and Global Integration Activities. (c) In fiscal 2018, the amount represents the write-off of debt discount and deferred financing costs in connection with the refinancing of the Coty Credit Agreement and Galleria Credit Agreement, included in Loss on early extinguishment of debt in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. (d) The amount in fiscal 2018 represents one-time gains of $1.4 on short-term forward contracts to exchange euros for U.S. dollars to repay U.S. dollar debt balances outstanding under the Coty Credit Agreement and Galleria Credit Agreement, in connection with the refinancing 42 of those respective agreements in April 2018, included in Interest expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The amount in fiscal 2017 represents a net loss of $1.4 incurred in connection with the acquisition of the Hypermarcas Brands and subsequent intercompany loans, included in Interest expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. (e) The amounts represent the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments included in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest based on the relevant noncontrolling interest percentage in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Quarterly Results of Operations Data The following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the periods ended June 30, 2019 . We have prepared the quarterly consolidated statements of operations data on a basis consistent with the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the financial information reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data. This information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report.

Additionally, in fiscal 2019, we adopted authoritative guidance issued by the FASB for ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost , the impacts of which were applied to the financial results of the fiscal 2018 periods presented. FINANCIAL CONDITION LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview As of June 30, 2019 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $340.4 compared with $331.6 at June 30, 2018 . Our cash and cash equivalents balances increased by $8.8 during fiscal 2019 primarily as a result of cash generated from operations and net borrowings from long-term debt, partially offset by cash used for capital expenditures, dividend payments to shareholders and acquisitions. During fiscal 2019 , we increased our cash held outside of the U.S. by $28.9 . Our cash flows are subject to seasonal variation throughout the year, including demands on cash made during our first fiscal quarter in anticipation of higher global sales during the second fiscal quarter and strong cash generation in the second fiscal quarter as a result of increased demand by retailers associated with the holiday season. Our principal uses of cash are to fund planned operating expenditures, capital expenditures, interest payments, acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases and any principal payments on debt. The working capital movements are based on the sourcing of materials related to the production of products within each of our segments. The phasing of payments to vendors also impacts our working capital from time-to-time as we seek to efficiently manage our cash and working capital requirements. As a result of the cash on hand, our ability to generate cash from operations and through access to our revolving credit facility and other lending sources, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our ongoing needs on both a near term and long-term basis. Debt On April 5, 2018, we completed an offering of three series of U.S. dollar denominated and euro denominated senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $550.0 and 800 million , in a private offering. On April 5, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement which amended and restated the existing credit agreements. The credit agreement provides for senior secured credit facilities comprised of (i) a five year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount up to $3,250.0 , (ii) a five year term loan A facility consisting of (a) $1,000.0 denominated in U.S. dollars and (b) 2.035 billion denominated in Euros and (iii) a seven year term loan B facility consisting of (a) $1,400.0 denominated in U.S. dollars and (b) 850 million denominated in Euros. Future borrowings under the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement could be used for corporate purposes. On June 27, 2019, we entered into an amendment ( 2019 Amendment ) to the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement. The 2019 Amendment modified the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement by amending the financial covenants to (i) delay until March 31, 2022 the total net leverage ratio step down from 5.25 to 5.0, (ii) extend the applicable window for certain cost savings add-backs in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for purpose of determining the total net leverage ratio, and (iii) amend the determination of the exchange rate to be used for purposes of calculating Total Indebtedness (as defined in the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement) for purposes of the total net leverage ratio, and decreasing the total commitments under the revolving credit facility by $500.0 to $2,750.0 . See Note 14 Debt in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our debt arrangements and prior period credit agreements. Receivables Purchase Agreement On March 19, 2019, we entered into an Uncommitted Receivables Purchase Agreement (the Receivables Purchase Agreement ) with a financial institution, with an aggregate facility limit of $150.0 . Eligible trade receivables are purchased by the financial institution for cash at net invoice value less a factoring fee. Cash received from the selling of receivables under the Receivables Purchase Agreement are presented as a change in trade receivables within the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 , total trade receivables factored under the Receivables Purchase Agreement, was $267.3 and $118.3 , on a gross basis and net of collections, respectively. The net factored amount primarily reflects the timing of certain trade receivables factored late in the fourth fiscal quarter. 44 Business Combinations We did not enter into any business combinations in fiscal 2019 . For additional information on our prior period business combinations from fiscal years 2018 and 2017, see Note 3 Business Combinations in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Dispositions We did not divest of any brands during fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2018, we divested the Playboy and Cerruti brands and related assets for total proceeds of $33.0 . We allocated $12.3 of goodwill to these brands as part of the sale. We recorded a non-cash loss of $28.6 which has been reflected in Loss (gain) on sale of brand assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Cash Flows Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data: (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 639.6 $ 413.7 $ 757.5 Net cash used in investing activities (454.0 ) (687.6 ) (1,163.6 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (160.3 ) 69.3 595.2 Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $639.6 , $413.7 and $757.5 for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The increase in operating cash inflows in fiscal 2019 as compared with fiscal 2018 was $225.9 . This increase is primarily driven by an increase of $286.5 in net income after adjusting for non-cash items only partially offset by increased outflows from net changes in working capital accounts of $60.7. The increase in net income after adjusting for non-cash items in fiscal 2019, compared to fiscal 2018, as noted above. Working capital changes included an increase in cash outflows from accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $642.4 which were only partially offset by higher inflows from trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventory of $581.7. The increase in cash outflows from accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities were mainly the result of decreases in current restructuring accruals for payments of prior year amounts accrued, combined with decreases in trade spend related payables and accruals due to a smaller revenue base decreasing the level of trade spending. Changes in trade receivables contributed to $424.5 of the increase in cash inflows during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 mainly due to positive results from stronger collection efforts and the implementation of additional factoring facilities. Net cash used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was $(454.0) , $(687.6) and $(1,163.6) for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The decrease in cash used for investing activities of $233.6 in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily relates to higher cash outflows of $237.2 from cash paid in prior year for business combinations including the Burberry Beauty Business for $245.1 and other acquisition related activity of $32.4 compared to cash outflows in the current year of $40.8 for the purchase of a trademark. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities wa s $(160.3) , $69.3 and $595.2 for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The decrease in cash inflows of $229.6 in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to lower net borrowings of $294.8. These decreases were partially offset by cash increases from lower payments for debt issuance costs of $37.7 and lower cash dividend payments of $29.6. Dividends On May 8, 2019, the Board approved a stock dividend reinvestment program giving shareholders the option to receive their full dividend in cash or to receive their dividend in 50% cash / 50% common stock. Shareholders were able to make this election on a quarterly basis, beginning with the dividend declared on May 8, 2019. The percentage of our total Common Stock for which the shareholders elected to participate in the Stock Dividend Reinvestment Program for the June 28, 2019 dividend was 68% . As may be declared by the Board of Directors (the Board ), we anticipate issuing future dividends on a quarterly basis. For additional information on our dividends, see Note 22 Equity in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 45 Treasury Stock - Share Repurchase Program For additional information on our Share Repurchase Program, see Note 22 Equity in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our principal contractual obligations and commitments as of June 30, 2019 are presented below: (in millions) Total Payments Due in Fiscal Thereafter 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Long-term debt obligations $ 7,740.5 $ 189.3 $ 189.3 $ 189.3 $ 4,090.9 $ 23.6 $ 3,058.1 Interest on long-term debt obligations (a) 1,913.3 276.1 286.3 306.3 310.9 269.0 464.7 Operating lease obligations 721.5 122.2 111.2 91.3 76.7 67.8 252.3 License agreements: (b) Royalty payments 761.4 157.4 100.2 81.4 65.0 60.3 297.1 Other contractual obligations (c) 590.2 371.6 95.2 66.8 33.8 22.3 0.5 Other long-term obligations: Pension obligations (mandated) (d) 90.3 17.5 17.8 18.0 18.4 18.6 Total $ 11,817.2 $ 1,134.1 $ 800.0 $ 753.1 $ 4,595.7 $ 461.6 $ 4,072.7 (a) Interest costs on our debt after consideration of our interest rate swap arrangements are determined based on interest rate forecast and assumptions of the amount of debt outstanding. A 25 basis-point increase in our variable interest rate debt would have increased our interest costs by $88.3 over the term of our long-term debt. (b) Obligations under license agreements relate to royalty payments and required advertising and promotional spending levels for our products bearing the licensed trademark. Royalty payments are typically made based on contractually defined net sales. However, certain licenses require minimum guaranteed royalty payments regardless of sales levels. Minimum guaranteed royalty payments and required minimums for advertising and promotional spending have been included in the table above. Actual royalty payments and advertising and promotional spending are expected to be higher. Furthermore, early termination of any of these license agreements could result in potential cash outflows that have not been reflected above. (c) Other contractual obligations primarily represent advertising/marketing, manufacturing, logistics and capital improvements commitments. Additionally, we have included the mandatorily redeemable financial instruments arising out of our subsidiaries as discussed in Note 20 Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Interest . We also maintain several distribution agreements for which early termination could result in potential future cash outflows that have not been reflected above. (d) Represents future contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans over the next five years mandated by local regulations or statutes. Subsequent funding requirements cannot be reasonably estimated as the return on plan assets in future periods, as well as future assumptions are not known. The table above excludes obligations for uncertain tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of $179.9 as of June 30, 2019 , as we are unable to predict when, or if, any payments would be made. See Note 16 Income Taxes in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our uncertain tax benefits. The table excludes $451.8 of RNCI which is reflected in Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2019 related to our 25.0% RNCI in our subsidiary in the Middle East ( Middle East Subsidiary ) and our 40.7% interest in our subsidiary Foundation, LLC ( Foundation ). Given the provisions of the associated Put and Call rights, both RNCI are redeemable outside of our control and are recorded in temporary equity. See Note 21 Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion related to the calculation of the redemption value for each of these noncontrolling interests. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities We are exposed to foreign currency exchange fluctuations and interest rate volatility through our global operations. We utilize natural offsets to the fullest extent possible in order to identify net exposures. In the normal course of business, established policies and procedures are employed to manage these net exposures using a variety of financial instruments. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Management We operate in multiple functional currencies and are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For foreign currency exposures, which primarily relate to receivables, inventory purchases and sales, payables and intercompany loans, derivatives are used to better manage the earnings and cash flow volatility arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We recorded foreign currency losses of $3.5 , $3.9 and $1.5 in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, resulting 46 from non-financing foreign currency exchange transactions which are included in their associated expense type and are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net gains (losses) of $7.6 , $8.5 and $(12.8) in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, resulting from financing foreign exchange currency transactions are included in Interest expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net (losses) of nil , nil and $(1.7) in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, resulting from acquisition-related foreign exchange currency transactions are included in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Exchange gains or losses are also partially offset through the use of qualified derivatives under hedge accounting, for which we record accumulated gains or losses in Accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction occurs at which time the gain or loss is reclassified into the respective account in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of balance sheet transactional exposures. As of June 30, 2019 , in the event of a 10.0% unfavorable change in the prevailing market rates of hedged foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, the change in fair value of all foreign exchange forward contracts would result in a $7.7 increase in the fair value of the forward contracts. In the view of management, these hypothetical gains resulting from an assumed change in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial statement position or results of operations. This gain does not include the impact on our underlying foreign currency exposures. Interest Rate Risk Management We are exposed to interest rate risk that relates primarily to our indebtedness, which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates primarily in the U.S. and Europe. We periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to facilitate our interest rate management activities. We have designated these agreements as cash flow hedges and, accordingly, applied hedge accounting. The effective changes in fair value of these agreements are recorded in AOCI/(L), net of tax, and ineffective portions are recorded in current- period earnings. Amounts in AOCI/(L) are subsequently reclassified to earnings as interest expense when the hedged transactions are settled. We expect that both at the inception and on an ongoing basis, the hedging relationship between any designated interest rate hedges and underlying variable rate debt will be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively. The corresponding gain or loss position of the ineffective hedge recorded to AOCI/(L) will be reclassified to current-period earnings. If interest rates had been 10% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, Loss before income taxes in fiscal 2019 would decrease/increase by $27.1 . During August 2018, we extended the maturity of our interest rate swap portfolio, in order to maintain a 50:50 ratio of fixed to floating rate debt through 2021 to better manage our medium term exposure to interest rate increases. Looking forward, we expect that the fixed to floating rate debt ratio will improve as we reduce the notional value of our floating rate debt. We intend to continue to target a 50:50 euro to U.S. dollar liability split under our long term debt agreements which would match our underlying cash inflows, to manage our exposure to foreign exchange risk in the financial markets. Credit Risk Management We attempt to minimize credit exposure to counterparties by generally entering into derivative contracts with counterparties that have an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the fair value of contracts in net asset positions, which totaled $1.7 as of June 30, 2019 . Accordingly, management believes risk of material loss under these hedging contracts is remote. Inflation Risk To date, we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures in the future, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, as well as the trading price of our securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 . Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect 47 the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results may differ from those estimates that would result in material changes to our operating results and financial condition. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, the assessment of goodwill, other intangible and long-lived assets for impairment, business combinations, inventory, pension benefit costs, income taxes and the valuation of redeemable noncontrolling interests. Our management has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Net revenues comprise gross revenues less customer discounts and allowances, actual and expected returns (estimated based on an analysis of historical experience and position in product life cycle) and various trade spending activities. Trade spending activities represent variable consideration promised to the customer and primarily relate to advertising, product promotions and demonstrations, some of which involve cooperative relationships with customers. The costs of trade spend activities are estimated considering all reasonably available information, including contract terms with the customer, the Company historical experience and its current expectations of the scope of the activities, and is reflected in the transaction price when sales are recorded. For additional information on our revenue accounting policies, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Returns represent 2% , 2% and 2% of gross revenue after customer discounts and allowances in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Trade spending activities recorded as a reduction to gross revenue after customer discounts and allowances represent 8% , 8% , and 7% in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Our sales return accrual reflects seasonal fluctuations, including those related to the holiday season in the first half of our fiscal year. This accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net revenues, and is calculated based on history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels. In addition, as necessary, specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events. The types of known or anticipated events that we have considered, and will continue to consider, include the financial condition of our customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment, and our decision to continue to support new and existing brands. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not approximate future returns, additional allowances may be required. Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Goodwill Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets. Other intangible assets consist of indefinite-lived trademarks. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. We assess goodwill at least annually as of May 1 for impairment, or more frequently, if certain events or circumstances warrant. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the same level as our reportable segments. We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our reporting segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components. When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as the basis to determine if it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. In performing our qualitative assessment, we consider the extent to which unfavorable events or circumstances identified, such as changes in economic conditions, industry and market conditions or company specific events, could affect the comparison of the reporting unit fair value with its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test. Quantitative impairment testing for goodwill is based upon the fair value of a reporting unit as compared to its carrying value. We make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for our reporting units. The impairment loss recognized would be the difference between a reporting unit carrying value and fair value in an amount not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill. Testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and assumptions. The assumptions made will impact the outcome and ultimate results of the testing. We use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and, in certain instances, we engage independent third-party valuation specialists for advice. To determine fair value of the reporting unit, we used a 48 combination of the income and market approaches. We believe the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risk associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis, and this combination is indicative of the factors a market participant would consider when performing a similar valuation. Under the income approach, we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows. Under the market approach, we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, which creates valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting units being tested, to value the reporting unit. The key estimates and factors used in these approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on our internal forecasts, our specific weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows, and comparable market multiples for the industry segment as well as our historical operating trends. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in actual and expected consumer consumption and demands, could result in changes to these assumptions and judgments. A revision of these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge. Such charge could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Balance Sheets. There were no impairments of goodwill at our reporting units in fiscal 2018 or 2017. During fiscal 2019, we recorded total goodwill impairments of $3,391.1, resulting in remaining goodwill balances as of June 30, 2019 of $1,216.4, $2,921.7 and $935.7, in our Consumer Beauty, Luxury and Professional Beauty reporting units, respectively. The goodwill impairment charge was a result of the following impairment tests: In the course of evaluating the results for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we noted that since the previous impairment test, the cash flows associated with our Consumer Beauty reporting unit were adversely impacted by negative category trends and market share losses in the color cosmetics, hair color and mass fragrance categories; additional shelf-space losses for CoverGirl, Clairol, and Max Factor; expected increased costs in the short-term to offset the lower service levels caused by supply chain disruptions; and lower than expected net revenues and profitability for Younique. Additionally, we included the impact of a 75 basis point increase in the discount rate on the valuation model, due to changes in the market assumptions, which adversely affected the fair value of the reporting unit. We concluded that these factors represented indicators of impairment that warranted an interim impairment test for goodwill and certain other intangible assets in the Consumer Beauty reporting unit. To determine the fair value of our Consumer Beauty reporting unit, we used an updated average annual revenue growth rate of (3.3)% for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 and a discount rate of 8.0%. The result of the interim impairment test showed that the fair value of the reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, resulting in an $832.5 goodwill impairment charge. There were no impairments of goodwill at other reporting units during the interim impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Based on the annual impairment test performed at May 1, 2019, we determined that the fair values of our Luxury and Professional Beauty reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values at that date by approximately 70.4% and 22.5%, respectively. For our Consumer Beauty reporting unit, we determined that the fair value did not exceed the carrying value, and as such we recorded an asset impairment charge of $2,558.6 related to goodwill of the Consumer Beauty reporting unit. The cash flows associated with our Consumer Beauty reporting unit were adversely affected by factors that developed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 including fourth quarter net revenue results and market share trends that were below expectations, continued net revenue and profitability declines for Younique in excess of management expectations, and the development of our Turnaround Plan to stabilize operations and improve profitability. The Turnaround Plan impacted the projected cash flows associated with the Consumer Beauty reporting unit by lowering revenue growth and, in the near term, margin expectations. Such changes in our estimated forecasts were based on a top down review of the business which resulted in decisions to simplify the product range as well as identify priority brand-country combinations and invest behind such combinations at scale, which will initially lower net revenues and profits. The Turnaround Plan also considered the latest market data including continued negative category trends in the color cosmetics, hair color and mass fragrance categories that were below expectations and indicated a longer required recovery period. Additionally, the forecast was updated to include the costs of the Turnaround Plan. Overall, these factors negatively impacted the cash flows of the Consumer Beauty reporting unit and resulted in a decrease in our assumed terminal growth rate, which also adversely affected the fair values. To determine the fair value of our Consumer Beauty reporting unit, we used an updated average annual revenue growth rate of (5.9)% for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023, a 1.0% decrease in the terminal growth rate since the second quarter of fiscal 2019, and a discount rate of 8.0%. As the Consumer Beauty reporting unit was impaired, it has a 0% excess and as such, further material negative trends in its actual and expected business performance or an increase in the discount rate may result in further impairments. If the average annual revenue growth rate for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 declined by 1% it may cause an additional impairment of $214.0. If the discount rate increased by 0.5%, it may cause an additional impairment of $195.5. 49 We believe the assumptions used in calculating the estimated fair value of the reporting units are reasonable. However, we can provide no assurances that we will achieve such projected results. Further, we can provide no assurances that we will not have to recognize additional impairment of goodwill in the future due to other market conditions or changes in our discount rates. Recognition of additional impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill would negatively affect our reported results of our operations and total capitalization. Other Intangible Assets We assess indefinite-lived other intangible assets (trademarks) at least annually as of May 1 for impairment, or more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. Trademarks are tested for impairment on a brand level basis. The trademarks fair values are based upon the income approach, primarily utilizing the relief from royalty methodology. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset. An impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. Fair value calculation requires significant judgments in determining both the assets estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value. Variations in economic conditions or a change in general consumer demands, operating results estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. The carrying value of our indefinite-lived other intangible assets was $2,729.8 as of June 30, 2019, and is comprised of trademarks for the following brands: OPI of $661.8, CoverGirl of $501.0, the professional product line of Wella of $413.0, Max Factor of $247.0, Sally Hansen of $161.9, philosophy of $156.4, ghd related trademarks of $149.6, Bourjois of $67.0, Clairol of $32.7 and other trademarks totaling $339.4. On May 1, 2018 and 2017 , we performed our annual impairment testing of indefinite-lived other intangible assets and determined that no adjustments to carrying values were required. During fiscal 2019, we recorded total impairments on our indefinite-lived other intangible assets of $429.1, resulting in a balance as of June 30, 2019 of $1,324.7, $177.4 and $1,227.7 in our Consumer Beauty, Luxury and Professional Beauty reporting units, respectively. The impairment charges were a result of the following impairment tests: As noted above, in the course of evaluating the results for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the cash flows associated with the Consumer Beauty reporting unit were adversely impacted during the quarter which warranted an interim impairment test for goodwill and certain other intangible assets in the Consumer Beauty reporting unit. Accordingly, we re-evaluated future cash flows of intangible assets and the impact of a 75 basis point increase to the discount rate. This resulted in asset impairment charges of $90.8 related to indefinite-lived other intangible assets for our CoverGirl, Clairol and a regional Brazilian skin care trademark, and $7.0 related to a finite-lived other intangible asset for a regional hair license agreement. The fair value of the CoverGirl trademark fell below its carrying value using projections that assumed an average annual growth rate of (3.3)% for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 and a discount rate of 8.5%. The fair value of the Clairol trademark fell below its carrying value using projections that assumed an average annual growth rate of (6.1)% for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 and a discount rate of 8.5%. The fair value of the regional Brazilian skin care trademark fell below its carrying value using projections that assumed an annual growth rate of 7.7% for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 and a discount rate of 13.0%. The regional hair license agreement was concluded to be fully impaired due to on-going shelf space losses. In addition to the Consumer Beauty reporting unit, we also identified indicators of impairment related to the philosophy trademark that is part of the Luxury reporting unit during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. In addition to the impact of a 75 basis point increase in the discount rate, we considered the impact of lower than expected net revenue growth in the U.S. during the quarter, shelf space losses at key retailers and a decrease in the level of expected profitability of the trademark. We concluded that the fair value of the philosophy trademark fell below its carrying value using projections that assumed an average annual growth rate of 1.2% for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 and a discount rate of 8.5%. This resulted in an asset impairment charge of $22.8. As part of the May 1, 2019 annual impairment test, we considered the impact of the certain factors on the cash flows of the indefinite-lived other intangible assets associated with the Consumer Beauty reporting unit that developed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. This resulted in asset impairment charges of $201.7 related to indefinite-lived other intangible assets for our CoverGirl, Max Factor, Sally Hansen, Bourjois, Clairol and two regional Brazilian trademarks. These factors included fourth quarter net revenue results below expectations, and the development of our Turnaround Plan to stabilize operations and improve profitability. The Turnaround Plan impacted the projected cash flows associated with our indefinite-lived other intangible assets by lowering revenue growth and, in the near term, margin expectations. Such changes in our estimated forecasts were based on a top down review of the business which resulted in decisions to simplify the product range as well as identify priority brand-country combinations and invest behind such combinations at scale, which will initially lower net revenues and profits. The Turnaround Plan also considered the latest market data including continued negative category trends 50 in the color cosmetics, hair color and mass fragrance categories that were below expectations and indicated a longer required recovery period. Overall, these factors negatively impacted the cash flows of our indefinite-lived other intangible assets and resulted in a decrease in their assumed terminal growth rates, which also adversely affected their fair values. Additionally we noted the fair values of the indefinite-lived other intangible assets were adversely impacted by an additional 25 basis point increase to the discount rate due to changes in market assumptions. Based on results of the test, the fair value of the Max Factor trademark fell below its carrying value using projections that assumed an average annual growth rate of (4.8)% for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 and a discount rate of 8.75%. The fair value of the Bourjois trademark fell below its carrying value using projections that assumed an average annual growth rate of (14.9)% for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 and a discount rate of 8.75%. The fair value of the CoverGirl trademark fell below its carrying value using projections that assumed an average annual growth rate of (2.2)% for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 and a discount rate of 8.75%. The fair value of the Sally Hansen trademark fell below its carrying value using projections that assumed an average annual growth rate of (4.9)% for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 and a discount rate of 8.75%. The fair value of the Clairol trademark fell below its carrying value using projections that assumed an average annual growth rate of (5.7)% for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 and a discount rate of 8.75%. We also noted during the annual impairment test that the cash flows related to the philosophy trademark decreased since the second quarter of fiscal 2019 mainly due to updated projections as a result of a revised strategy for the business developed as part of the Turnaround Plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 to simplify the product range. The fair value of the philosophy trademark was also adversely affected by a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate for trademarks, since the second quarter of fiscal 2019. This caused the fair value of the philosophy trademark to fall below its carrying value using projections that assumed an average annual growth rate of (6.1)% for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 and a discount rate of 8.75%. This resulted in an asset impairment charge of $86.8. Further, we noted during the annual impairment test that the cash flows related to the professional product line of Wella trademark were adversely impacted by lower than expected revenue in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and the impact of a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate for the trademark since the fiscal 2018 annual impairment test. This caused the fair value of the professional product line of Wella trademark to fall below its carrying value using projections that assumed an average annual growth rate of (1.0)% for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 and a discount rate of 8.75%. This resulted in an asset impairment charge of $27.0. As the impaired indefinite-lived intangible assets have a 0% excess, further material negative trends in the actual and expected business performance or an increase in the discount rate may result in further impairments. For instance, with regards to our CoverGirl trademark, our largest impaired indefinite-lived intangible asset, if the average annual revenue growth rate for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 declined by 1% it may cause an additional impairment of $26.0. If the discount rate increased by 0.5%, it may cause an additional impairment of $31.0. With regards to our professional product line of Wella trademark, our second largest impaired indefinite-lived intangible asset, if the average annual revenue growth rate for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 declined by 1% it may cause an additional impairment of $21.0. If the discount rate increased by 0.5%, it may cause an additional impairment of $24.0. As of May 1, 2019, we determined that the fair value of our ghd trademark exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5.4% using projections that assumed an average annual revenue growth rate of 5.8% for fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 and a discount rate of 10.5%. The fair value of the ghd trademark would fall below its carrying value if the average annual revenue growth rate decreased by approximately 96 basis points or the discount rate increased by 45 basis points. The fair values of the remaining indefinite-lived trademarks exceeded their carrying values by amounts ranging from 27.1% to more than 100%. We believe the assumptions used in calculating the estimated fair value of the trademarks are reasonable and attainable. However, we can provide no assurances that we will not have to recognize additional impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the future due to other market conditions or changes in our discount rates. Recognition of additional impairment of a significant portion of our indefinite-lived intangible assets would negatively affect our reported results of operations and total capitalization. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, including tangible and intangible assets with finite lives, are amortized over their respective lives to their estimated residual values and are also reviewed for impairment whenever certain triggering events may indicate impairment. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by discounting future cash flows. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we recorded asset impairment charges of $27.8 and $15.6 , respectively, primarily relating to the planned disposal of certain manufacturing facilities, and the write-off of machinery and equipment in excess of our needs 51 due to our Global Integration Activities. The impairment charges are included in Restructuring costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were no impairments on long-lived assets in fiscal 2017. Business Combinations We allocate the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact our future operating results, as we recognize depreciation and amortization expense on long-lived assets. We use a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisers for the values and lives of property, identifiable intangibles and inventories; and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations and liabilities associated with legal, environmental or other claims. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. The fair value estimates are based on historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to manage the acquired brands. Other intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment of intangible assets that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment. The costs of determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over the estimated useful life. We generally use the following methodologies for valuing our significant acquired intangibles assets: Trademarks (indefinite or finite) - We use a relief from royalty method to value trademarks. The key assumptions for the model are forecasted net revenue, the royalty rate, the effective tax rate and the discount rate. Customer relationships and license agreements - We use an excess earnings method to value customer relationships. The key assumptions for the model are forecasted net revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ), the estimated allocation of earnings between different classes of assets, the attrition rate, the effective tax rate and the discount rate. Inventory Inventories include items which are considered salable or usable in future periods, and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being based on standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Costs include direct materials, direct labor and overhead (e.g., indirect labor, rent and utilities, depreciation, purchasing, receiving, inspection and quality control) and in-bound freight costs. We classify inventories into various categories based upon their stage in the product life cycle, future marketing sales plans and the disposition process. We also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the excess of the cost of the inventory over its estimated net realizable value, based on various product sales projections. This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends, and requirements to support forecasted sales. In addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events. These estimates could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the amounts that we may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels, product discontinuances, sales return levels, competitive conditions or other factors differ from our estimates and expectations. Pension Benefit Costs We sponsor both funded and unfunded pension plans in various forms covering employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements. We use several statistical and other factors in an attempt to estimate future events in calculating the liability and expense related to these plans. Certain significant variables require us to make assumptions such as anticipated discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension obligations. While we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges, an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a material impact on reported net income. The discount rates used to measure the benefit obligations at the measurement date and the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent fiscal year are reset annually using data available at the measurement date. The long-term rates of return on our pension plan assets are based on management expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the assets in which the plan is invested, as well as current economic and market conditions. The difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other 52 comprehensive income (loss). Those gains or losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods. In fiscal 2019 , our pension plans had actual returns on assets of $3.5 as compared with expected return on assets of $8.2 , which resulted in a net deferred gain/(loss) of $(4.7) , substantially all of which is currently subject to be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 9 to 28 years. The actual return on assets was primarily related to the performance of equity markets during the past fiscal year. The weighted-average assumptions used to determine our projected benefit obligation were as follows: Pension Plans U.S. International 2019 2018 2019 2018 Discount rates 3.2%-3.6% 4% 0.4%-8.4% 0.6%-8.0% The weighted-average assumptions used to determine our net periodic benefit cost during the fiscal year were as follows: Pension Plans U.S. International 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 Discount rates 4.0% 3.6% 3.3%-3.8% 0.6%-8.0% 0.4%-7.5% 0.2%-7.8% Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets N/A N/A N/A 2.0%-8.4% 1.8%-8.2% 1.6%-6.0% The actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions. Differences from these assumptions could significantly impact the actual amount of net periodic benefit cost and liability recorded by us. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes. Deferred taxes are recorded at currently enacted statutory tax rates and are adjusted as enacted tax rates change. A valuation allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on currently available evidence. We consider how to recognize, measure, present and disclose in financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. We are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. We classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. For unrecognized tax benefits, we first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. As the determination of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, including associated interest and penalties, requires significant estimates to be made by us, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on our operating results or financial condition and cash flows. Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of examinations by tax authorities, developments in case law and closing of statute of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the provision for income taxes as appropriate. In addition, we are present in approximately 55 tax jurisdictions and we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act changing the U.S. to a modified territorial tax system, the Company no longer asserts that any of its undistributed foreign earnings are permanently reinvested. We do not expect to incur significant withholding or state taxes on future distributions. To the extent there remains a basis difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of an 53 investment in a foreign subsidiary after the repatriation of the previously taxed income of $4,600.0 , the Company is permanently reinvested. The Tax Act requires a U.S. shareholder of a foreign corporation to include in income its global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI ). In general, GILTI is described as the excess of a U.S. shareholder total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets. As a result of recently released FASB guidance, an entity may choose to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or an entity can elect to treat GILTI as a period cost and include it in the tax expense of the year it is incurred. As such, we have elected to treat the tax on GILTI as a tax expense in the year it is incurred rather than recognizing deferred taxes. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Interests held by third parties in consolidated majority-owned subsidiaries are presented as noncontrolling interests, which represents the noncontrolling stockholders interests in the underlying net assets of Coty consolidated majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interests, where we may be required to repurchase the noncontrolling interest under a put option or other contractual redemption requirement, are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets between liabilities and equity, as redeemable noncontrolling interests ( RNCI ). We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interests to the higher of the redemption value or the carrying value (the acquisition date fair value adjusted for the noncontrolling interest share of net income (loss) and dividends) on each balance sheet date with changes recognized as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital ( APIC ). Younique We use an income approach, a market approach or a combination of these approaches to estimate the fair value of the RNCI related to our subsidiary Foundation, which holds a 100% interest in Younique, LLC. The income approach is used to determine the fair value of the Foundation RNCI using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of the business, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows. For the market approach, we use a selected multiple based on comparable companies multiplied by the forecasted cash flows. The key estimates and factors used in this approach include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and profit margins based on our internal forecasts and the entity specific weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.
