ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with the Selected Financial Data and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those we discuss under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K. General Overview We are the leading provider of postsecondary education for students seeking careers as professional automotive, diesel, collision repair, motorcycle and marine technicians as measured by total average undergraduate enrollment and graduates. We offer undergraduate degree, diploma or certificate programs at 11 campuses across the United States. We also offer advanced training programs including both student paid electives at our campuses and manufacturer or dealer sponsored training at dedicated training centers. We have provided technical education for 46 years. Our revenues consist principally of student tuition and fees derived from the programs we provide and are presented after reductions related to discounts and scholarships we sponsor, refunds for students who withdraw from our programs prior to specified dates and the portion of tuition students have funded through our proprietary loan program. We generally recognize tuition revenue and fees ratably over the terms of the various programs we offer. We supplement our tuition revenues with additional revenues from sales of textbooks and program supplies, student housing and other revenues, all of which are recognized as sales occur or services are performed. In aggregate, these additional revenues represented less than 3% of our total revenues in each year for the three-year period ended September 30, 2011. Tuition revenue and fees generally vary based on the average number of students enrolled and average tuition charged per program. Average undergraduate full-time student enrollments vary depending on, among other factors, the number of continuing students at the beginning of a period, new student enrollments during the period, students who have previously withdrawn but decide to re-enroll during the period, graduations and withdrawals during the period. Our average undergraduate full-time student enrollments are influenced by: the attractiveness of our program offerings to high school graduates and potential adult students; the effectiveness of our marketing efforts; the depth of our industry relationships; the strength of employment markets and long term career prospects; the quality of our instructors and student services professionals; the persistence of our students; the length of our education programs; the availability of federal and alternative funding for our programs; the number of graduates of our programs who elect to attend the advanced training programs we offer and general economic conditions. Our introduction of additional program offerings at existing campuses and opening additional campuses is expected to influence our average undergraduate full-time student enrollment. We currently offer start dates at our campuses that range from every three to six weeks throughout the year in our various undergraduate programs. The number of start dates of advanced training programs varies by the duration of those programs and the needs of the manufacturers who sponsor them. 51 Our tuition charges vary by type and length of our programs and the program level, such as undergraduate or advanced training. Tuition rates have increased by approximately 4% to 7% for the year ended September 30, 2011 and 3% to 5% for each of the years ended September 30, 2010 and 2009. We continually evaluate our tuition pricing based on individual campus markets, the competitive environment and ED regulations. Most students at our campuses rely on funds received under various government-sponsored student financial aid programs, predominantly Title IV Programs, to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education-related expenses. In 2011, approximately 75% of our revenues, on a cash basis as defined by ED, were derived from federal student financial aid programs. We extend credit for tuition and fees, for a limited period of time, to the majority of our students. Our credit risk is mitigated through the students participation in federally funded financial aid programs unless students withdraw prior to the receipt by us of Title IV funds for those students. The financial aid and assistance programs are subject to political and budgetary considerations. There is no assurance that such funding will be maintained at current levels. Extensive and complex regulations govern the financial assistance programs in which our students participate. Our administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies. Any regulatory violation could be the basis for the initiation of potential adverse actions including a suspension, limitation, placement on reimbursement status, or termination proceeding which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If any of our institutions were to lose its eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs, the students at that institution, and other locations of that institution, would lose access to funds derived from those programs and would have to seek alternative sources of funds to pay their tuition and fees. The receipt of financial aid funds reduces the students amounts due to us and has no impact on revenue recognition, as the transfer relates to the source of funding for the costs of education which may occur through Title IV or other funds and resources available to the student. Additionally, we bear all credit and collection risk for the portion of our student tuition that is funded through our proprietary loan program. We categorize our operating expenses as (i) educational services and facilities and (ii) selling, general and administrative. Major components of educational services and facilities expenses include faculty and other campus administration employees compensation and benefits, facility rent, maintenance, utilities, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment used in the provision of educational services, tools, training aids, royalties under our licensing arrangements and other costs directly associated with teaching our programs and providing educational services to our students. Selling, general and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits of employees who are not directly associated with the provision of educational services, such as: executive management; finance and central accounting; legal; human resources; marketing and student enrollment expenses, including compensation and benefits of personnel employed in sales and marketing and student admissions; costs of professional services; bad debt expense; costs associated with the implementation and operation of our student management and reporting system; rent for our corporate office headquarters; depreciation and amortization of property and equipment that is not used in the provision of educational services and other costs that are incidental to our operations. All marketing and student enrollment expenses are recognized in the period incurred. Costs related to the opening of new facilities, excluding related capital expenditures, are expensed in the period incurred or when services are provided. 2011 Overview Operations Similar to many companies, we experienced macro-economic headwinds during 2011 with one of the specific challenges related to the stabilization of the unemployment rate. While the unemployment rate in 2011 has remained high, the change in the rate has stabilized. Our ability to recruit new students is correlated to the change in the unemployment rate. Traditionally, during periods when the unemployment rate accelerates our ability to recruit new students improves as unemployed people seek to develop their skill set to improve their 52 employment opportunities. We experienced this during 2008 and 2009. Conversely, during periods when the unemployment rate declines, our ability to recruit new students has traditionally become more challenging as prospective students have more employment options. Since the unemployment rate in 2011 has stabilized, we experienced challenges in our ability to recruit new students. We anticipate we will continue to face challenges recruiting new students while the unemployment rate remains stable. Changes in social patterns also presented a challenge during the year. The recession of 2007-2009 had a profound effect on the saving habits of the American public. A general wariness of debt has replaced the previous enthusiasm for debt as a financial tool. Because virtually all of our students receive financial assistance of some kind, this aversion to taking on debt has shaped the attitudes of prospective students, their parents and other decision influencers. Balancing our response to unique pressures during 2011 with our commitment to invest in our future was another challenge we encountered. For example, one of our objectives is to grow profitably, which, more than any other factor, demands growing our student population. Enrollment was declining during the year, which meant we needed to slow down our spending while still making investments to accommodate a rising enrollment in the future. We were successful in maintaining our selling, general and administrative expenses at approximately 40% of total revenue. Our revenues for the year ended September 30, 2011 were $451.9 million, an increase of $16.0 million from the prior year, primarily due to an increase in average undergraduate full-time student enrollment during the first three quarters of the year. Tuition rates increased between 4% and 7%, depending on the program, which also contributed to revenue growth for the year ended September 30, 2011. Our revenues excluded $7.0 million of tuition revenue related to students participating in our proprietary loan program. Our net income for the year was $27.2 million, a decrease of $1.6 million from the prior year. The decline in net income is primarily related to our increased investment in educational services and facilities, increased advertising expenses and increased compensation and related costs. Our operating results were impacted by an overall increase in compensation and benefits for the year ended September 30, 2011. This increase was primarily due to an increase in staffing levels to meet the increase of our average undergraduate full-time student enrollment that occurred during the first three quarters of the year. During the three months ended June 30, 2011 we completed a reduction in our workforce of approximately 195 employees nationwide in June 2011, which resulted in severance of $4.3 million. This action was critical to align the size of our workforce with our projected future student population. The increase in compensation and benefits was also related to modifications made to our compensation plans in response to new regulations issued by ED which became effective July 1, 2011. We started 16,200 students during the year ended September 30, 2011, which represents a decrease of 17.1% as compared to an increase of 10.7% for the year ended September 30, 2010. The decrease in starts is partially due to a decrease in student applications in the prior year and also the result of certain macro-economic headwinds and regulatory challenges. We expect the rate of decline experienced in 2011 in both applications and new student starts to slow in the first half of the year before potentially improving in the second half of the year. However, given our current enrollment levels, the macro-economic headwinds and the challenging regulatory environment we operate in, we anticipate the average student population for 2012 to decline by a rate in the low teens. We expect these lower levels of enrollments will result in a mid to high single digit decline in revenue in 2012. Given these trends, we are focused on efficiencies and managing costs, but do not anticipate reaching the same level of operating margins as was achieved in 2011. Furthermore, we plan on making our proprietary loan program more accessible to our current and prospective students and increase the number of need based scholarships in 2012 creating potential improvement in our show rates which would positively impact revenue. Due to the seasonality of our business and normal fluctuations in student populations, we would expect volatility in our quarterly results. 53 Regulatory Environment On October 29, 2010, ED issued new regulations pertaining to certain aspects of the administration of Title IV Programs, regulations which, with minor exceptions, became effective July 1, 2011. Since the publication of the new regulations, ED has issued guidance in the form of multiple Dear Colleague Letters to institutions. Currently, we have identified the rules concerning (i) state authorization, (ii) gainful employment, (iii) assignment of credit hours and clock hours, (iv) incentive compensation, (v) revisions to misrepresentation regulations and (vi) ED approvals for new programs as the rules most likely to materially impact our business. The program integrity rules require a large number of reporting and operational changes. However, we may be unable to fully develop, test and implement all of the necessary modifications to our information management systems and administrative processes by the required dates. We may be subject to administrative or other sanctions if we are unable to comply with these reporting and disclosure requirements on a timely basis. Additionally, these changes, individually or in the aggregate, may impact our student enrollment, persistence and retention in ways that we cannot now predict and could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. See Business Risk Factors Program Integrity included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K. Curriculum Transformation We transformed our Automotive Technology and Diesel Technology II curricula to a blend of daily instructor-led theory and hands-on lab training complimented by interactive web-based learning, which is reflective of current industry training methods and standards. In addition to improving the overall educational experience for our students, the new curricula offer more convenience and training flexibility for our students while meeting industry standards. We began offering the new curricula at the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas campus in June 2010. To date we have invested approximately $19.2 million for this transformation and anticipate investing within the range of $3.0 million to $5.0 million in tools, equipment and training aids during 2012 as part of the integration of the new curricula at our Avondale, Arizona campus in Spring 2012 and a second campus later in calendar year 2012. Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected statement of operations data as a percentage of revenues for each of the periods indicated. Year Ended September 30, 2011 2010 2009 Revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Operating expenses: Educational services and facilities 49.5 % 48.8 % 52.8 % Selling, general and administrative 40.5 % 40.6 % 42.1 % Total operating expenses 90.0 % 89.4 % 94.9 % Income from operations 10.0 % 10.6 % 5.1 % Interest income 0.0 % 0.1 % 0.1 % Other income 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.1 % Total other income 0.1 % 0.2 % 0.2 % Income before income taxes 10.1 % 10.8 % 5.3 % Income tax expense 4.1 % 4.2 % 2.1 % Net income 6.0 % 6.6 % 3.2 % 54 We opened a new campus in Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas in June 2010. For the years ended September 30, 2011, and 2010, this campus had revenues of $10.9 million and $1.2 million, operating expenses of $14.4 million and $8.3 million, and corporate allocations of $6.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively. Our earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the years ending September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $71.1 million, $67.8 million and $37.5 million, respectively. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which is provided to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. We choose to disclose to investors this non-GAAP financial measure because it provides an additional analytical tool to clarify our results from operations and helps to identify underlying trends. Additionally, such measure helps compare our performance on a consistent basis across time periods. To obtain a complete understanding of our performance, this measure should be examined in connection with net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Since the items excluded from this measure should be examined in connection with net income determined in financial performance under GAAP, this measure should not be considered to be an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating performance or profitability. Exclusion of items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure across companies. Investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating our financial performance. EBITDA reconciles to net income as follows: Year Ended September 30, 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net income $ 27,238 $ 28,828 $ 11,733 Interest income, net (252 ) (250 ) (198 ) Income tax expense 18,410 18,451 7,572 Depreciation and amortization 25,731 20,803 18,417 EBITDA $ 71,127 $ 67,832 $ 37,524 Return on equity for the trailing four quarters ended September 30, 2011 was 21.4% compared to 25.6% percent for the trailing four quarters ended September 30, 2010. Return on equity is calculated as the sum of our net income for the last four quarters divided by the average of our total shareholders equity balances at the end of each of the last five quarters. Capacity utilization is the ratio of our average undergraduate full-time student enrollment to total seats available. Total seats available represents our maximum capacity, however, due to certain dynamics, our operating capacity tends to be lower. The following table sets forth our average capacity utilization during each of the periods indicated and the total seats available at the end of each of the periods indicated: Year Ended September 30, 2011 2010 2009 Average undergraduate full-time student enrollment 18,500 18,600 15,900 Total seats available 29,500 27,200 24,800 Average capacity utilization 62.7 % 68.4 % 64.1 % During the years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we started 16,200 students, 19,500 students, and 17,600 students, respectively. During 2012, we plan to continue to seek alternate uses for our underutilized space at existing campuses. Alternate uses may include subleasing space to third parties, allocating additional space for use by our advanced training programs, adding new industry relationships or consolidating administrative functions into campus facilities. 55 Year Ended September 30, 2011 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2010 Revenues. Our revenues for the year ended September 30, 2011 were $451.9 million, representing an increase of $16.0 million, or 3.7%, as compared to revenues of $435.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2010. The increase was due to tuition rate increases between 4% and 7%, depending on the program, offset by an increase of $1.2 million in tuition scholarships. The increase in revenues is also attributable to an increase in average undergraduate full-time student enrollment during the first three quarters of the year. Our revenues excluded $7.0 million and $9.7 million of tuition related to students participating in our proprietary loan program. In accordance with our accounting policy, we will recognize the related revenue as payments are received from the students participating in this program. As a result of collections under our proprietary loan program, our revenues included $0.8 million and $0.2 million for the years ended September 30, 2011 and September 2010, respectively. Educational services and facilities expenses. Our educational services and facilities expenses for the year ended September 30, 2011 were $223.5 million, representing an increase of $10.9 million, or 5.1%, as compared to $212.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2010. Our educational services and facilities expenses for the year ended September 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010 for our Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas campus were $7.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively, including corporate allocations of $1.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The following table sets forth the significant components of our educational services and facilities expenses: Year Ended September 30, 2011 2010 (In thousands) Salaries expense $ 97,750 $ 89,630 Employee benefits and tax 19,560 17,013 Bonus expense 3,220 4,187 Stock-based compensation 939 685 Compensation and related costs $ 121,469 $ 111,515 Occupancy costs 36,824 36,410 Other educational services and facilities expenses 23,092 23,993 Depreciation expense 18,920 15,632 Tools and training aids expense 11,709 13,108 Supplies and maintenance 11,455 11,919 $ 223,469 $ 212,577 The increase in compensation and related costs for the year ended September 30, 2011 is primarily due to the hiring of additional staff dedicated to student employment services, and for the addition of instructors in order to support our higher average undergraduate full-time student enrollments that occurred during the first three quarters of the year. However, during the year we determined that in order to align our cost structure with our projected future student population, it was necessary to complete a reduction in workforce in June 2011 which resulted in severance expense of $2.3 million. Additionally, we had an increase of self-insurance claims which contributed to the increase of $2.5 million in employee benefits expense. Furthermore, the increase in compensation and related costs was impacted by modifications made to our compensation plans in response to the new regulations that became effective July 1, 2011. For the year ended September 30, 2011, the changes to our compensation plans decreased bonus expense by $1.0 million compared to September 30, 2010. Compensation and related costs for our Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas campus for the years ended September 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010 were $3.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively, including corporate allocations of $0.4 million and $0.1 million for the years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 56 Depreciation expense increased $3.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 primarily due to the addition of assets related to our Automotive Technology and Diesel Technology II curricula project and the opening of our Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas campus in June 2010 and was $2.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively, for the year ended September 30, 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2011 were $183.3 million, an increase of $6.5 million, or 3.7%, as compared to $176.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2010. Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010 for our Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas campus was $6.6 million and $4.3 million, respectively, including corporate allocations of $5.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively. The following table sets forth the significant components of our selling, general and administrative expenses: Year Ended September 30, 2011 2010 (In thousands) Salaries expense $ 70,132 $ 63,990 Employee benefits and tax 15,864 15,393 Bonus expense 7,809 16,212 Stock-based compensation 5,340 5,209 Compensation and related costs $ 99,145 $ 100,804 Advertising costs 34,605 32,552 Other selling, general and administrative expenses 26,002 23,694 Bad debt expense 8,279 6,520 Depreciation expense 6,802 5,161 Occupancy costs 3,101 2,309 Contract services expense 5,392 5,754 $ 183,326 $ 176,794 The increase in salaries expense for the year ended September 30, 2011 was primarily due to modifications made to our compensation plans in response to the new regulations that became effective July 1, 2011, which resulted in an additional $3.3 million in Admissions salary expense. The changes to our compensation plans also contributed to the decrease in bonus expense for the year. The increase was also attributable to the hiring of additional staff to support the transformation of our Automotive Technology and Diesel Technology II program curricula that was completed during the year. Furthermore, during the year we determined that in order to align our cost structure with our projected future student population, it was necessary to complete a reduction in workforce in June 2011 which resulted in severance expense of $1.4 million. Our compensation and related costs for the years ended September 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010 for our Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas, campus were $2.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively, including corporate allocations of $1.6 million and $1.3 million for the years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Advertising expense increased $2.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 primarily due to our spending on various media, including television, internet, magazine, and inquiry generation programs, our continued investment in local markets and an overall shift in strategy to higher quality inquiries. We anticipate our advertising expense will be in the range of 9%-10% of revenue for the year ended September 30, 2012. Bad debt expense represents 1.8% of revenue for the year ended September 30, 2011 and we anticipate bad debt expense to be in the range of 1.6% 1.7% of revenue for the year ended September 30, 2012. 57 Depreciation expense increased $1.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 primarily due to the addition of software developed for internal use, acceleration of depreciation related to the relocation of our corporate office headquarters in March 2011 and investments in information technology infrastructure. Income taxes. Our provision for income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2011 was $18.4 million, or 40.3% of pre-tax income compared to $18.5 million or 39.0% of pre-tax income for the year ended September 30, 2010. The effective income tax rate in each year differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35% primarily as a result of state income taxes, net of related federal income tax benefits. Net income. As a result of the foregoing, we reported net income for the year ended September 30, 2011 of $27.2 million, as compared to net income of $28.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2010. Year Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2009 Revenues. Our revenues for the year ended September 30, 2010 were $435.9 million, representing an increase of $69.3 million, or 18.9%, as compared to revenues of $366.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2009. The increase was due to a 17.0% increase in the average undergraduate full-time student enrollment, tuition rate increases between 3% and 5%, depending on the program, and a decrease of approximately $1.1 million in tuition scholarships. Our revenues for the year ended September 30, 2010 excluded $9.7 million of tuition related to students participating in our proprietary loan program. In accordance with our accounting policy, we will recognize the related revenue as payments are received from the students participating in this program. Additionally, industry training revenue decreased by $6.5 million due to reductions in and discontinuation of training for certain manufacturer specific training programs. Educational services and facilities expenses. Our educational services and facilities expenses for the year ended September 30, 2010 were $212.6 million, representing an increase of $19.1 million, or 9.9%, as compared to $193.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2009. The following table sets forth the significant components of our educational services and facilities expenses: Year Ended September 30, 2010 2009 (In thousands) Salaries expense $ 89,630 $ 82,087 Employee benefits and tax 17,013 16,526 Bonus expense 4,187 2,875 Stock-based compensation 685 573 Compensation and related costs $ 111,515 $ 102,061 Occupancy costs 36,410 36,175 Other educational services and facilities expenses 23,993 21,306 Depreciation expense 15,632 14,838 Tools and training aids expense 13,108 9,183 Supplies and maintenance 11,919 9,927 $ 212,577 $ 193,490 The increase in average undergraduate full-time student enrollment drove the increase in student centric variable costs including compensation and related costs, supplies and maintenance and tools and training aids. The significant components of educational services and facilities expenses at our Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas campus included $1.1 million related to tools and training aids and $0.9 million in compensation costs for instructors and other staff during the year ended September 30, 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2010 were $176.8 million, an increase of $22.3 million, or 14.4%, as compared to $154.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2009. 58 The following table sets forth the significant components of our selling, general and administrative expenses: Year Ended September 30, 2010 2009 (In thousands) Salaries expense $ 63,990 $ 58,900 Employee benefits and tax 15,393 14,021 Bonus expense 16,212 13,178 Stock-based compensation 5,209 4,129 Compensation and related costs $ 100,804 $ 90,228 Advertising costs 32,552 23,708 Other selling, general and administrative expenses 23,694 21,614 Bad debt expense 6,520 6,732 Depreciation expense 5,161 3,569 Occupancy costs 2,309 2,082 Contract services expense 5,754 6,571 $ 176,794 $ 154,504 Total compensation and related costs increased by approximately $10.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2010 as a result of an increase in the number of staff to support the growth associated with the increase in average undergraduate full-time student enrollments and an increase in the number of sales force representatives who were hired to drive an increase in the number of enrollments. Additionally, bonus expense increased $2.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2010, due to improved operating results. Advertising expense increased $8.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2010 primarily due to an increase in our advertising spend to generate high quality inquiries to support future student enrollments. Income taxes. Our provision for income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2010 was $18.5 million, or 39.0% of pre-tax income compared with $7.6 million or 39.2% of pre-tax income for the year ended September 30, 2009. The effective income tax rate in each year differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35% primarily as a result of state income taxes, net of related federal income tax benefits. Net income. As a result of the foregoing, we reported net income for the year ended September 30, 2010 of $28.8 million, as compared to net income of $11.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2009. Liquidity and Capital Resources Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash flow from operations, cash on hand and investments will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through the next 12 months. We believe that the strategic use of our cash resources includes supporting the integration of our Automotive Technology and Diesel Technology II curricula to existing campuses, as well as subsidizing funding alternatives for our students. Additionally, we evaluate the repurchase of our common stock, payment of dividends, consideration of strategic acquisitions and other potential uses of cash. To the extent that potential acquisitions are large enough to require financing beyond cash from operations, we may issue debt resulting in increased interest expense. Our aggregate cash and cash equivalents and current investments were $103.7 million and $77.5 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. A majority of our revenues are derived from Title IV Programs. Federal regulations dictate the timing of disbursements of funds under Title IV Programs. Students must apply for new funding for each academic year consisting of thirty-week periods. Loan funds are generally provided 59 by lenders in two disbursements for each academic year. The first disbursement is usually received after the start of a student academic year and the second disbursement is typically received at the beginning of the sixteenth week from the start of the student academic year. We established a proprietary loan program in which we bear all credit and collection risk and students are not required to begin repayment until six months after the student completes or withdraws from his or her program. These factors, together with the timing of when our students begin their programs, affect our operating cash flow. Operating Activities Our net cash provided by operating activities was $58.1 million, $67.5 million and $49.5 million for the years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The cash provided by in 2011 was primarily attributable to changes in our operating assets and liabilities and increased revenues resulting from an increase in tuition rates as well as an increase in average undergraduate full-time student enrollment that occurred during the first three quarters of the year. The increase from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to higher net income resulting from increased revenues due to an increase in our average undergraduate full-time student enrollment. Changes in operating assets and liabilities During the year ended September 30, 2011, the changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in cash outflows of $12.2 million. The outflows were primarily attributable to changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses, deferred rent liability, and income tax payable. The cash outflow of $15.6 million attributable to accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to the payments of 2010 bonuses, accelerated bonus payments in June due to modifications in our compensation plans and timing of our payroll cycle. The cash outflow was offset by the elimination of current bonus plans in order to comply with the new regulations effective July 1, 2011. In September 2010, we entered into a leasing arrangement to relocate our corporate office headquarters during the second quarter of 2011. The lease included incentives such as a leasehold improvement allowance, moving allowance, and free rent periods which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term resulting in a $6.2 million increase in deferred rent. We experienced a cash inflow of $3.3 million as a result of being in a payable position at September 30, 2011 rather than a receivable position for income taxes in the prior year. During the year ended September 30, 2010, the changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in cash inflows of $10.0 million. The inflows were a result of a $15.1 million increase in deferred revenue primarily due to the timing of student starts, the number of students in school and where they were at year end in relation to the completion of their program coupled with an increase in average undergraduate full-time student enrollment at September 30, 2010 compared to September 30, 2009. The inflows were also due to a $6.0 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily attributable to an increase in accrued bonuses as a result of improved operating results. There was a use of cash as a result of an increase in receivables by $9.9 million due to an increase in our average undergraduate full-time student enrollment. During the year ended September 30, 2009, the changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in cash inflows of $10.0 million. The inflows were primarily attributable to a $7.0 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily due to an increase in accrued bonuses as a result of improved operating results. The inflows were also due to a $3.5 million increase in deferred revenue which was primarily attributable to the timing of student starts, the number of students in school and where they were at year end in relation to the completion of their program coupled with an increase in average undergraduate full-time student enrollment at September 30, 2009 compared to September 30, 2008. 60 Investing Activities During the year ended September 30, 2011, cash used in investing activities was $54.0 million and was primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment and the purchase of investments in addition to investing in new and replacement training equipment for ongoing operations. The following is a summary of our significant investments in capital expenditure activities. We invested approximately $5.5 million in office leasehold improvements primarily related to our new corporate office headquarters. We invested approximately $4.1 million in the transformation of our Automotive Technology and Diesel Technology II program curricula. We invested approximately $3.4 million in equipment necessary to offer our Diesel and Industrial program at our Rancho Cucamonga, California campus. During the year ended September 30, 2012, we anticipate our investment in capital expenditures will be slightly below the amounts invested for the year ended September 30, 2011. We anticipate investing in the range of $3.0 million to $5.0 million in computer equipment and training aids during 2012 as part of the integration of our Automotive Technology and Diesel Technology II curricula at our Avondale, Arizona campus in Spring 2012 and a second campus later in calendar year 2012. During the year ended September 30, 2010, cash used in investing activities was $42.1 million and was primarily related to our investment in new and replacement training equipment for our ongoing operations. The following is a summary of our significant investments in capital expenditure activities. We invested approximately $10.5 million in building improvements and equipment for the Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas campus. We invested approximately $10.3 million in the transformation of our Automotive Technology and Diesel Technology II program curricula. During the year ended September 30, 2009, cash used in investing activities was approximately $57.4 million and was primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment, capital improvements and the purchase of investments. The following is a summary of our significant investments in capital expenditure activities. We invested approximately $9.3 million to purchase facilities for the Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas campus in addition to leasehold improvements at a temporary facility for this campus. We invested approximately $4.8 million in the transformation of our Automotive Technology and Diesel Technology II program curricula. Financing Activities During the year ended September 30, 2011, cash provided by financing activities was $0.6 million and was attributable to activity in our stock-based compensation plans. During the year ended September 30, 2010, cash used in financing activities was $32.6 million and was primarily attributable to the payment of a special cash dividend in July 2010 of $1.50 per share totaling $36.3 million to common stockholders of record as of July 6, 2010. During the year ended September 30, 2009, cash used in financing activities was $16.8 million and was attributable to the repurchase of our stock. Dividends We continuously evaluate our cash position in light of growth opportunities, operating results and general market conditions. Periodically, we may return shareholder earnings through cash dividends or stock repurchases, or a combination thereof. 61 Stock Repurchase Program Our Board of Directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to $70.0 million of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The timing and actual number of shares purchased will depend on a variety of factors such as price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and prevailing market conditions. We may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time without prior notice. Through September 30, 2011, we purchased 3.4 million shares at an average price per share of $13.50 and a total cost of approximately $46.4 million under this program. We did not make any purchases during the year ended September 30, 2011. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth, as of September 30, 2011, the aggregate amounts of our significant contractual obligations and commitments with definitive payment terms that will require cash outlays in the future. Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years (In thousands) Operating leases(1) $ 238,573 $ 26,335 $ 52,831 $ 49,940 $ 109,467 Purchase obligations(2) 42,827 22,829 10,080 6,993 2,925 Other long-term obligations 2,169 183 250 61 1,675 Total contractual commitments $ 283,569 $ 49,347 $ 63,161 $ 56,994 $ 114,067 (1) Minimum rental commitments. These amounts do not include property taxes, insurance or normal recurring repairs and maintenance. (2) Includes all agreements to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that are enforceable and legally binding. Additionally, purchase orders outstanding as of September 30, 2011, employment contracts and minimum payments under licensing and royalty agreements are included. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Each of our campuses must be authorized by the applicable state education agency in which the campus is located to operate and to grant degrees, diplomas or certificates to its students. Our campuses are subject to extensive, ongoing regulation by each of these states. Additionally, our campuses are required to be authorized by the applicable state education agencies of certain other states in which our campuses recruit students. Our insurers issue surety bonds for us on behalf of our campuses and education representatives with multiple states to maintain authorization to conduct our business. We are obligated to reimburse our insurers for any surety bonds that are paid by the insurers. As of September 30, 2011, the total face amount of these surety bonds was approximately $13.8 million. Related Party Transactions Information concerning related party transactions is included in Note 11 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements within Part II, Item 8 of this Report on Form 10-K. For a description of additional information regarding related party transactions, see the information included in our proxy statement for the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders under the heading Certain Relationships and Related Transactions . Seasonality Our revenues and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business, principally due to changes in total student population and costs associated with opening or expanding our campuses. Student population varies as a result of new student enrollments, graduations and student attrition. 62 Historically, our schools have had lower student populations in our third quarter than in the remainder of our year because fewer students are enrolled during the summer months. Additionally, our schools have had higher student populations in our fourth quarter than in the remainder of the year because more students enroll during this period. Our expenses, however, do not vary significantly with changes in student population and revenues and, as a result, such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. We expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns. Such patterns may change, however, as a result of new school openings, new program introductions, increased enrollments of adult students or acquisitions. Furthermore, our revenues for the first quarter ending December 31 are impacted by the closure of our campuses for a week in December for a holiday break and during which we do not earn revenue. Operating income is negatively impacted during the initial start up of new campus openings. We incur sales and marketing costs as well as campus personnel costs in advance of the campus opening. Typically we begin to incur such costs approximately 12 to 15 months in advance of the campus opening with the majority of the costs being incurred in the nine month period prior to a campus opening. Revenues Year Ended September 30, 2011 2010 2009 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent ($ in thousands) Three Month Period Ending: December 31 $ 117,447 26.0 % $ 103,522 23.7 % $ 90,121 24.6 % March 31 114,161 25.3 % 105,631 24.2 % 89,125 24.3 % June 30 108,934 24.1 % 107,525 24.7 % 87,852 24.0 % September 30 111,358 24.6 % 119,243 27.4 % 99,537 27.1 % $ 451,900 100.0 % $ 435,921 100.0 % $ 366,635 100.0 % Income (Loss) from Operations Year Ended September 30, 2011 2010 2009 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent ($ in thousands) Three Month Period Ending: December 31 $ 16,853 37.4 % $ 15,056 32.3 % $ 3,589 19.3 % March 31 11,390 25.3 % 9,884 21.2 % (203 ) (1.1 %) June 30 6,706 14.9 % 9,857 21.3 % 2,966 15.9 % September 30 10,156 22.4 % 11,753 25.2 % 12,289 65.9 % $ 45,105 100.0 % $ 46,550 100.0 % $ 18,641 100.0 % The decline in income from operations during the three months ended June 30, 2011 was primarily due to a reduction in workforce of 195 employees nationwide, which resulted in severance costs of $4.3 million. The increase in revenues and income from operations for the three months periods ended March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, was primarily due to an increase in our student population in 2010. The loss from operations during the three month period ended March 31, 2009 was primarily due to additional sales force representatives hired in response to our increase in quality inquiries, contract services expenses incurred for process improvement projects in financial aid and admissions and lower interest income due to a change in investments to lower risk, lower yielding mutual funds. 63 Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. During the preparation of these financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, our proprietary loan program, allowance for uncollectible accounts, investments, goodwill recoverability, bonus plans, self-insurance claim liabilities, income taxes, contingencies and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of our analysis form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements within Part II, Item 8 of this Report on Form 10-K. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. Revenue recognition. Revenues consist primarily of student tuition and fees derived from the programs we provide after reductions are made for discounts and scholarships we sponsor. Tuition and fee revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the course or program offered. If a student withdraws from a program prior to a specified date, all or a portion of deferred tuition revenue is refunded. Approximately 97% of our revenues for each of the years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 consisted of tuition. Our undergraduate programs are typically designed to be completed in 45 to 102 weeks and our advanced training programs range from 14 to 24 weeks in duration. We supplement our revenues with sales of textbooks and program supplies, student housing and other revenues. Sales of textbooks and program supplies, revenue related to student housing and other revenue are each recognized as sales occur or services are performed. Deferred revenue represents the excess of tuition and fee payments received, as compared to tuition and fees earned, and is reflected as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheets because it is expected to be earned within the next twelve months. Proprietary Loan Program. In order to provide funding for students who are not able to fully finance the cost of their education under traditional governmental financial aid programs, commercial loan programs or other alternative sources, we established a private loan program with a national chartered bank in 2008. Under terms of the related agreement, the bank originates loans for our students who meet our specific credit criteria with the related proceeds used exclusively to fund a portion of their tuition. We then purchase all such loans from the bank on a monthly basis and assume all of the related credit risk. The loans bear interest at market rates; however, principal and interest payments are not required until six months after the student completes or withdraws from his or her program. After the deferral period, monthly principal and interest payments are required over the related term of the loan. In substance, we provide the students who participate in this program with extended payment terms for a portion of their tuition and as a result, we account for the underlying transactions in accordance with our tuition revenue recognition policy. However, due to the nature of the program coupled with the extended payment terms required under the student loan agreements, collectability is not reasonably assured. Accordingly, we recognize tuition and loan origination fees financed by the loan and any related interest income required under the loan when such amounts are collected. We will reevaluate this policy on the basis of our historical collection experience under the program and will accelerate recognition of the related revenue if appropriate. All related expenses incurred with the bank or other service providers are expensed as incurred. Since collectability is not reasonably assured, the loans cannot be recorded as assets under GAAP, and therefore, the loans and related deferred tuition revenue are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. Our presentation will be reevaluated when sufficient collection history has been obtained. Allowance for uncollectible accounts. We maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability, failure or refusal of our students to make required payments. We offer a 64 variety of payment plans to help students pay that portion of their education expenses not covered by financial aid programs or alternate fund sources, which are unsecured and not guaranteed. Management analyzes accounts receivable, historical percentages of uncollectible accounts, customer credit worthiness and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts. We use an internal group of collectors, augmented by third party collectors as deemed appropriate, in our collection efforts. Although we believe that our allowance is adequate, if the financial condition of our students deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if we underestimate the allowances required, additional allowances may be necessary, which would result in increased selling, general and administrative expenses in the period such determination is made. Investments. We invest in pre-funded municipal bonds, which are generally secured by escrowed-to-maturity U.S. Treasury notes. Municipal bonds represent debt obligations issued by states, cities, counties, and other governmental entities, which earn interest that is exempt from federal income taxes. Additionally, we invest in certificates of deposit issued by financial institutions and corporate bonds from large cap industrial and selected financial companies with a minimum credit rating of A. We have the ability and intention to hold our investments until maturity and therefore classify these investments as held-to-maturity, and report them at amortized cost. Investments with an original maturity date of 90 days or less at the time of purchase are classified as cash equivalents and investments with a maturity date greater than one year at the end of the period are classified as non-current. We review our held-to-maturity investments for impairment quarterly to determine if other-than-temporary declines in the carrying value have occurred for any individual investment. Other-than-temporary declines in the value of our held-to-maturity investments are recorded as expense in the period in which the determination is made. We determined that no other-than-temporary declines occurred in our held-to-maturity investments during the years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment, which might result from the deterioration in the operating performance of the acquired business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in the applicable laws or regulations and a variety of other circumstances. Any resulting impairment charge would be recognized as an expense in the period in which impairment is identified. Our goodwill resulted from the acquisition of our motorcycle and marine education business in 1998. We allocated such goodwill, which totaled $20.6 million, to two of our reporting units that provide the related educational programs. We assess our goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates estimated future cash flows for the next five years and an associated terminal value. Key management assumptions included in the cash flow model include future tuition revenues, operating costs, working capital changes, capital expenditures and a discount rate that approximates our weighted average cost of capital. While actual experience will differ from the amounts included in our cash flow model, we do not believe that a related impairment of our goodwill is reasonably possible in the foreseeable future. Self-Insurance. We are self-insured for a number of risks including claims related to employee health care and dental care and workers compensation. The accounting for our self-insured plans involves estimates and judgments to determine our ultimate liability related to reported claims and claims incurred but not reported. We consider our historical experience, severity factors, actuarial analysis and existing stop loss insurance in estimating our ultimate insurance liability. If our insurance claim trends were to differ significantly from our historic claim experience, we would make a corresponding adjustment to our insurance reserves. Income taxes . We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and establish a valuation allowance if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowance are included in our statement of operations as a charge or credit to income tax expense. We make assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining our provisions for income taxes, assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws, and the outcome of future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided 65 for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assessment of recoverable deferred tax assets inaccurate. Contingencies. In the ordinary conduct of the business, we are subject to occasional lawsuits, investigations and claims, including, but not limited to, claims involving students and graduates and routine employment matters. When we are aware of a claim or potential claim, we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure. If it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability for the loss. If the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we disclose the nature of the specific claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible and the amount involved is material. There can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome of any of the lawsuits, investigations or claims pending against us will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Stock-based Compensation. We measure all share-based payments to employees at estimated fair value. We recognize the compensation expense for option grants and restricted stock awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For stock awards with market conditions, we recognize compensation expense over the requisite period. Option exercise prices are based upon the per share closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each option on the date of grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model based on certain valuation assumptions. The risk-free interest rate is based on a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bill with a maturity date approximately equal to the expected life of the option at the grant date. We apply the simplified method for calculating the expected term of the grant which is the weighted mid-point between the vesting date of the grant and the expiration date of the stock option agreement. Our dividend rate has historically been assumed to be zero because we have not historically paid dividends, other than the special cash dividend of $1.50 paid July 16, 2010. We derive our expected volatility using a method that includes an analysis of companies within our industry sector, including UTI, to calculate the annualized historical volatility. Compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards is measured based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. The requisite service period for restricted stock awards is generally the vesting period. Compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that are expected to vest, which we estimate based upon historical forfeitures. In September 2010 and 2009, our Board of Directors approved grants of stock units with vesting of the grant subject to a market condition (market shares). The market condition is based on total shareholder return which is the comparison of the change in our stock price and dividends to the change in stock price and dividends of the companies included in a nationally recognized stock index for the measurement periods included in the grant. On the settlement date for each measurement period, participants will receive shares of our common stock equal to 0% to 200% of the market shares originally granted depending on where our total shareholder return ranks among the companies included in the related index for that measurement period. The fair value of the market shares at grant date for each measurement period was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation which required assumptions for expected volatilities, correlation coefficients, risk-free rates of return, and dividend yields. Expected volatilities were derived using a method that calculates historical volatility over a period equal to the length of the measurement period for UTI and the companies included in the related index. Correlation coefficients were based on the same data used to calculate historical volatilities and were used to model how our stock price moves in relation to the companies included in the related index. We used a risk-free rate of return that is equal to the yield of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bill that is commensurate with each measurement period, and we assumed that any dividends paid were reinvested. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements which are not yet effective is included in Note 3 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements within Part II, Item 8 of this Report on Form 10-K. As indicated in Note 3, we do not expect any of the recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material effect on our financial statements. 66
