ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview We are a leading metals service center that operates in three reportable segments; carbon flat products, specialty metals flat products, and tubular and pipe products. We provide metals processing and distribution services for a wide range of customers. Our carbon flat products segment focus is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. Our specialty metals flat products segment focus is on the direct sale and distribution of processed aluminum and stainless flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products and fabricated parts. In addition, we distribute metal tubing, pipe, bar, valves and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets. Products that require more value-added processing generally have a higher gross profit. Accordingly, our overall gross profit is affected by, among other things, product mix, the amount of processing performed, the demand for and availability of metals, and volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs. We also perform toll processing of customer-owned metals. We sell certain products internationally, primarily in Canada, Mexico and Dominican Republic. International sales are immaterial to our consolidated financial results and to the individual segments results. Our results of operations are affected by numerous external factors including, but not limited to: general and global business, economic, financial, banking and political conditions; fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies, competition; metals pricing, demand and availability; energy prices; pricing and availability of raw materials used in the production of metals; global supply, the level of metals imported into the United States, and inventory held in the supply chain; customers ability to manage their credit line availability; and layoffs or work stoppages by our own, our suppliers or our customers personnel. The metals industry also continues to be affected by the global consolidation of our suppliers, competitors and end-use customers. Like other metals service centers, we maintain substantial inventories of metals to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon customer forecasts, historic buying practices, supply agreements with customers and market conditions. Our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. We have entered into nickel and carbon swaps at the request of our customers in order to mitigate our customers risk of volatility in the price of metals, and we have entered into metals hedges to mitigate our risk of volatility in the price of metals. We have no long-term, fixed-price metals purchase contracts. When metals prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower gross profits and earnings as we use existing metals inventory. When metals prices increase, competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers. To the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers, the net sales and gross profits of our business could be adversely affected. Reportable Segments The Company operates in three reportable segments; carbon flat products, specialty metals flat products and tubular and pipe products. The carbon flat products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment are at times consolidated and referred to as the flat products segment. Some of the flat products segments assets and resources are shared by the carbon and specialty metals segments and both segments products are stored in the shared facilities and, in some locations, processed on shared equipment. As such, total assets and capital expenditures are reported in the aggregate for the flat products segments. Due to the shared assets and resources, certain of the flat products segment expenses are allocated between the carbon flat products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment based upon an established allocation methodology. The financial information for 2014 has been recast to reflect the new segment reporting structure. 28 We follow the accounting guidance that requires the utilization of a management approach to define and report the financial results of operating segments. The management approach defines operating segments along the lines used by the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, to assess performance and make operating and resource allocation decisions. Our CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based primarily on operating income. Our operating segments are based on internal management reporting. Due to the nature of the products sold in each segment, there are significant differences in the segments average selling price and the cost of materials sold. The tubular and pipe products segment generally has the highest average selling price among the three segments followed by the specialty metals flat products and carbon flat products segments. Due to the nature of the tubular and pipe products, we do not report tons sold or per ton information. Gross profit per ton is generally higher in the specialty metals flat products segment than the carbon flat products segment. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales is generally highest in the tubular and pipe products segment, followed by the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments. Due to the differences in average selling prices, gross profit and gross profit percentage among the segments, a change in the mix of sales could impact total net sales, gross profit, and gross profit percentage. In addition, certain inventory in the tubular and pipe products segment is valued under the LIFO method. Adjustments to the LIFO inventory value are recorded to cost of materials sold and may impact the gross margin and gross margin percentage at the consolidated Company and tubular and pipe products segment levels. Carbon flat products The primary focus of our carbon flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in most metals consuming industries, including manufacturers and fabricators of transportation and material handling equipment, construction and farm machinery, storage tanks, environmental and energy generation equipment, automobiles, military vehicles and equipment, as well as general and plate fabricators and metals service centers. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force. Specialty metals flat products The primary focus of our specialty metals flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of processed stainless and aluminum flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products and fabricated parts. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in various industries, including manufacturers of food service and commercial appliances, agriculture equipment, transportation and automotive equipment. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force. Combined, the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments have 22 strategically-located processing and distribution facilities in the United States and one in Monterrey, Mexico. Many of our facilities service both the carbon and the specialty metals flat products segments, and certain assets and resources are shared by the segments. Our geographic footprint allows us to focus on regional customers and larger national and multi-national accounts, primarily located throughout the midwestern, eastern and southern United States. Tubular and pipe products The tubular and pipe products segment consists of the Chicago Tube and Iron, or CTI, business, acquired in 2011. Through our tubular and pipe products segment, we distribute metal tubing, pipe, bar, valve and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets. Founded in 1914, CTI operates from nine locations in the midwestern and southeastern United States. The tubular and pipe products segment distributes its products primarily through a direct sales force. Corporate expenses Corporate expenses are reported as a separate line item for segment reporting purposes. Corporate expenses include the unallocated expenses related to managing the entire Company (i.e., all three segments), including compensation for certain personnel, expenses related to being a publicly traded entity such as board of directors expenses, audit expenses, and various other professional fees. 29 Results of Operations 2016 Compared to 2015 Our results of operations are impacted by the market price of metals. Over the past 24 months, metals prices have fluctuated significantly and changes to our net sales, cost of materials sold, gross profit, cost of inventory and profitability, are all impacted by industry metals pricing. During 2015, the hot-rolled carbon coil index pricing declined by approximately 36% as a result of the strengthened U.S. dollar, a historically high level of imported material arriving in the United States, low raw material costs to produce metals and a global oversupply of metals. The pricing environment in 2015 drove our average selling prices down and caused margins to be pressured as the average cost of inventory did not decrease as quickly as the average selling price as we traditionally keep approximately two and a half to three months of inventory on hand. During the first six months of 2016, the market price of metals increased and fully recovered the decrease experienced during 2015. Metals market pricing peaked in June 2016, and then decreased until November 2016. Metals prices in December 2016 were not as high as the June 2016 prices, but were more than 65% per ton higher than the December 2015 prices. Although prices increased during 2016, the average selling price during 2016 was still lower than the average selling price during 2015. Transactional or spot selling prices generally move in tandem with market price changes, while fixed selling prices typically lag and reset quarterly. Similarly, inventory costs (and therefore cost of materials sold) tend to move slower than market selling price changes due to mill lead times and inventory turnover impacting the rate of change in average cost. As sales volumes were relatively flat between the years, lower average selling prices were the driver for our decreased net sales in 2016. When the average selling price decreases, and net sales decreases, the gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales will generally increase. The following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars shown in thousands): 2016 2015 $ % of net sales $ % of net sales Net sales $ 1,055,116 100.0 $ 1,175,543 100.0 Cost of materials sold (a) 820,040 77.7 942,214 80.2 Gross profit (b) 235,076 22.3 233,329 19.8 Operating expenses (c) 229,328 21.7 236,157 20.1 Goodwill and intangible asset impairment (d) - (0.0 ) 24,951 2.1 Operating loss 5,748 0.5 (27,779 ) (2.4 ) Other loss, net (55 ) (0.0 ) (125 ) (0.0 ) Interest and other expense on debt 5,273 0.5 5,690 0.5 Income (loss) before income taxes 420 0.0 (33,594 ) (2.9 ) Income taxes 1,498 0.1 (6,817 ) (0.6 ) Net loss $ (1,078 ) (0.1 ) $ (26,777 ) (2.3 ) (a) Includes $1,489 and $3,347 of LIFO income for 2016 and 2015, respectively. (b) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (c) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. Excludes goodwill and intangible asset impairment shown seperately below for comparability purposes. (d) The 2015 non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge is seperately displayed for operating expense comparability purposes. $24,451 of the impairment charge is related to the tubular and pipe products segment and $500 is related to the specialty metals flat products segment. 30 Net sales decreased $120.4 million, or 10.2%, to $1.06 billion in 2016 from $1.18 billion in 2015. Carbon flat products net sales decreased $94.4 million, or 12.3%, and were 63.6% of total net sales in 2016 compared to 65.1% in 2015. Specialty metals flat products net sales decreased $2.6 million, or 1.3%, and were 18.0% of total net sales in 2016 compared to 16.4% in 2015. Tubular and pipe products net sales decreased $23.4 million, or 10.8%, and were 18.4% of total net sales in 2016 compared to 18.5% of total net sales in 2015. The decrease in sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to a 10.2% decrease in average selling prices as sales volumes were flat between years. Average selling prices decreased in all segments during 2016 compared to 2015 as market pricing for metals was still lower year-over-year. During the year, we increased our market share for all of the product categories that we sell. Cost of materials sold decreased $122.2 million, or 13.0%, to $820.0 million in 2016 from $942.2 million in 2015. During 2016, we recorded LIFO income of $1.5 million compared to LIFO income of $3.3 million recorded in 2015. The decrease in cost of materials sold in 2016 is due to the decreased metals costs of 12.9% during 2016 as sales volumes were flat between years. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased to 22.3% in 2016 from 19.8% in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased in the carbon flat products segment to 21.2% from 19.2% in 2015 and in the tubular and pipe products segment to 32.6% from 32.5% in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased in the specialty metals flat products segment to 15.7% in 2016 from 8.2% in 2015. LIFO income increased gross profit by 0.1% and 0.3% of net sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales during 2016 was primarily due to the cost of materials sold decreasing more than selling prices in all segments. Operating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) decreased $6.8 million, or 2.9%, to $229.3 million in 2016 from $236.2 million in 2015. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 21.7% in 2016 from 20.1% in 2015. Warehouse and processing costs decreased $5.9 million, or 6.9%, primarily due to reductions in labor hours worked. Administrative costs decreased by $1.9 million, or 3.0%, primarily related to reductions in labor and personnel expenses and lower variable based incentive compensation. Distribution expense increased by $0.4 million, or 1.2%, on flat sales volumes. Selling expenses increased $1.9 million, or 9.0%, as a result of hiring additional sales professionals. Occupancy expenses decreased $0.8 million as a result of elimination of certain leased warehouse space. Depreciation expense decreased $0.6 million, or 3.0%, as a result of certain assets being fully depreciated in 2016. Operating expenses in the carbon flat products segment decreased $7.6 million, operating expenses in the specialty metals products segment increased $3.0 million, operating expenses in the tubular and pipe products segment decreased $2.5 million, and Corporate expenses increased $0.3 million. The goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in 2015 included a $16.5 million non-cash goodwill impairment and a $8.0 million intangible asset impairment for the tubular and pipe products segment as well as a $0.5 million goodwill impairment for the specialty metals flat products segment. The 2015 goodwill impairment charges fully impaired the goodwill for both the tubular and pipe products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment. Interest and other expense on debt totaled $5.3 million in 2016 compared to $5.7 million in 2015. Our effective borrowing rate, exclusive of deferred financing fees and commitment fees, was 2.4% in 2016 compared to 2.1% in 2015. The decrease in interest and other expense on debt in 2016 was attributable to lower average borrowings during 2016 compared to 2015. Income before income taxes totaled $0.4 million in 2016 compared to a loss before income taxes of $33.6 million in 2015. 2015 loss before income taxes includes goodwill impairment charges of $17.0 million and a $8.0 million intangible asset impairment charge. An income tax provision of 356.7% was recorded for 2016, compared to an income tax benefit of (20.3%) in 2015. The effective tax rate is disproportionately high in 2016 from comparative periods due to low income before taxes relative to items that impact the effective tax rate. The 2016 effective income tax rate was impacted by increased valuation allowances and non-deductible expenses. The 2015 effective income tax rate was impacted by the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment charges. The income tax benefit for 2015 prior to the goodwill impairment charge was 39.8%. We expect our 2017 income tax rate to approximate 38% to 40%. Net loss for 2016 totaled $1.1 million, or $0.10 per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $26.8 million, or $2.39 per basic and diluted share, for 2015. The goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2015 impacted earnings per share by $1.93 per basic and diluted shares. 31 Segment Results of Operations Carbon flat products The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the carbon flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data): 2016 2015 % of net sales % of net sales Direct tons sold 952,888 935,165 Toll tons sold 73,880 102,360 Total tons sold 1,026,768 1,037,525 Net sales $ 670,983 100.0 $ 765,400 100.0 Average selling price per ton 653 738 Cost of materials sold 529,021 78.8 618,674 80.8 Gross profit (a) 141,962 21.2 146,726 19.2 Operating expenses (b) 146,333 21.8 153,943 20.1 Operating loss $ (4,371 ) (0.6 ) $ (7,217 ) (0.9 ) (a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (b) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. Tons sold decreased 1.0% to 1.03 million tons in 2016 from 1.04 million tons in 2015. Toll tons sold decreased 27.8% to 74 thousand tons in 2016 from 102 thousand tons in 2015. The decrease in tons sold is due to decreased customer demand and lower industry-wide shipments by U.S. service centers in 2016 compared to 2015. Despite the further softening of industry-wide shipments in 2016, we grew our market share in all of the carbon flat product categories we sell. Net sales decreased $94.4 million, or 12.3%, to $671.0 million in 2016 from $765.4 million in 2015. Average selling prices in 2016 decreased 11.4% to $653 per ton, compared to $738 per ton in 2015. The decrease in sales was primarily due to a 11.4% decrease in average selling prices during 2016 as volumes were down only 1%. The decrease in the average selling price is a result of lower prices in the metals industry during 2016 discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above. We expect market carbon flat metals prices in the first quarter of 2017 to increase over the prices in the fourth quarter of 2016. Cost of materials sold decreased $89.7 million, or 14.5%, to $529.0 million in 2016 from $618.7 million in 2015. The decrease in cost of materials sold was due to a 13.6% decrease in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2016 compared to 2015 as volumes were down only 1% between years. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) increased to 21.2% in 2016 from 19.2% in 2015. The increase in gross profit percentage in 2016 was primarily due to the cost of materials sold decreasing more than selling prices. The average gross profit per ton sold declined to $138 in 2016 from $141 in 2015 due to the significant decline in market prices for metals in 2016. Operating expenses in 2016 decreased $7.6 million, or 4.9%, to $146.3 million from $153.9 million in 2015 exceeding the sales volume decrease of 1.0%. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 21.8% for 2016 from 20.1% in 2015. Operating expenses decreased through reductions in labor and personnel expenses, lower variable based incentive compensation, lower depreciation expense and lower occupancy expense as a result of elimination of certain leased warehouse space offset by an increase in distribution expense and increased selling expenses as a result of hiring additional sales professionals. Operating loss for 2016 totaled $4.4 million compared to operating loss of $7.2 million in 2015. 32 Specialty metals flat products The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the specialty metals flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data): 2016 2015 % of net sales % of net sales Direct tons sold 82,156 72,041 Toll tons sold 129 36 Total tons sold 82,285 72,077 Net sales $ 189,930 100.0 $ 192,516 100.0 Average selling price per ton 2,308 2,671 Cost of materials sold 160,185 84.3 176,686 91.8 Gross profit (a) 29,745 15.7 15,830 8.2 Operating expenses (b) 19,904 10.5 16,904 8.8 Goodwill impairment charge (c) - - 500 0.2 Operating income (loss) $ 9,841 5.2 $ (1,574 ) (0.8 ) (a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (b) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. Excludes goodwill impairment charge shown separately below for comparability purposes. (c) The 2015 non-cash goodwill impairment charge is separately displayed for operating expense comparability purposes. Tons sold increased 14.2% to 82 thousand tons in 2016 from 72 thousand tons in 2015. The specialty metals flat products segment increased its market share in both the stainless steel and aluminum products it sells. Net sales decreased $2.6 million, or 1.3%, to $189.9 million in 2016 from $192.5 million in 2015. Average selling prices in 2016 decreased to $2,308 per ton, compared to $2,671 per ton in 2015. The decrease in sales was due to a 13.6% decrease in the average selling price during 2016 offset by a 14.2% increase in sales volume. The decrease in the year-over-year average selling price per ton is a result of lower market prices of stainless steel and aluminum in 2016. Average market prices for nickel (a component of stainless steel) were also lower in 2016 compared to 2015. We expect stainless steel and aluminum market prices in the first quarter of 2017 to increase over the fourth quarter 2016 prices. Cost of materials sold decreased $16.5 million, or 9.3%, to $160.2 million in 2016 from $176.7 million in 2015. The decrease in cost of materials sold was due to a 20.6% decrease in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2016 compared to 2015, offset by a 14.2% sales volume increase. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) increased to 15.7% in 2016 from 8.2% in 2015. The average gross profit per ton sold totaled $361 in 2016 compared to $220 per ton in 2015. The increase in the gross profit percentage is a result of our cost of materials sold decreasing more than the average selling price in 2016 compared to 2015 as inventory turnover improved in 2016. Operating expenses (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased $3.0 million, or 17.7%, to $19.9 million in 2016 from $16.9 million in 2015. The increase in operating expenses is related to the increased sales volume of 14.2%. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 10.5% of net sales in 2016 from 8.8% in 2015. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution, wages and variable based incentive compensation increased as a result of higher sales volumes and improved profitability. In 2015 we recorded a $0.5 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge as a result of the continued market pressures which fully eliminated the goodwill for the specialty metals flat products segment. Operating income for 2016 totaled $9.8 million compared to operating loss of $1.6 million in 2015. 33 Tubular and pipe products The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the tubular and pipe products segment for 2016 and 2015 (dollars shown in thousands). 2016 2015 $ % of net sales $ % of net sales Net sales $ 194,203 100.0 $ 217,627 100.0 Cost of materials sold (a) 130,834 67.4 146,854 67.5 Gross profit (b) 63,369 32.6 70,773 32.5 Operating expenses (c) 55,656 28.7 58,190 26.8 Goodwill and intangible asset impairment (d) - - 24,451 11.2 Operating income (loss) $ 7,713 3.9 $ (11,868 ) (5.5 ) (a) Includes $1,489 and $3,347 of LIFO income in 2016 and 2015, respectively. (b) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (c) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. (d) The 2015 non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges are separately displayed for operating expense comparability purposes. Net sales decreased $23.4 million, or 10.8%, to $194.2 million in 2016 from $217.6 million in 2015. The decrease in net sales was due to a 0.8% decrease in sales volume and a 10.0% decrease in average selling prices during 2016. The decrease in volume was due to decreased customer demand and lower industry-wide shipments of pipe and tube products. The decrease in average selling prices were due to lower industry market prices for metals in 2016 compared to 2015. Cost of materials sold decreased $16.0 million, or 10.9%, to $130.8 million in 2016 from $146.9 million in 2015. The decrease in cost of materials sold was due to a 0.8% decrease in sales volume and a 10.2% decrease in the average cost of materials sold which was impacted by the LIFO income of $1.5 million in 2016 compared to LIFO income of $3.3 million in 2015. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) remained relatively flat at 32.6% in 2016 compared to 32.5%, in 2015. The LIFO income increased gross profit by 0.8% of net sales in 2016 compared to 1.5% of net sales in 2015. Operating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) decreased $2.5 million, or 4.4%, to $55.7 million from $58.2 million in 2015. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 28.7% in 2016 compared to 26.8% in 2015. Variable operating expenses, such as variable performance-based incentive compensation, decreased in 2016 as a result of lower sales and income before impairment charges. In 2015 we recorded a $16.5 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge and an $8.0 million non-cash intangible asset impairment charge. There were no intangible asset impairment charges recorded in 2016. Operating income for 2016 totaled $7.7 million, compared to an operating loss of $11.9 million in 2015. The operating loss for 2015 was the result of the goodwill impairment of $16.5 million and the asset impairment charge of $8.0 million. Corporate expenses Corporate expenses increased $0.3 million, or 4.4%, to $7.4 million in 2016 compared to $7.1 million in 2015. The increase in corporate expenses is primarily attributable to our President of Specialty Metals being appointed to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and the associated transfer of expenses from the Specialty Metals flat products segment to the Corporate expenses in 2016. Corporate expenses include the unallocated expenses related to managing the entire Company (i.e. all three segments), including compensation for certain personnel, expenses related to being a publicly traded entity such as board of directors expenses, audit expenses, and various other professional fees. 34 2015 Compared to 2014 The metals industry experienced a significant decline in the price of metals during 2015 as a result of the strengthened U.S. dollar, a historically high level of imported materials arriving in the United States, low raw material costs to produce metals and a global oversupply of metals. The price of hot-rolled carbon flat steel decreased approximately 41% during 2015. Similarly, the price of stainless steel and aluminum decreased during 2015. The declines in metals shipments and pricing negatively impacted our 2015 sales and earnings. Industry demand also softened in 2015 compared to 2014 as evidenced by lower year over year shipments by metals service centers in the United States. During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded an impairment charge in our tubular and pipe products segment as a result of the continued decline in metals pricing and its impact on the tubular and pipe products segment results. The impairment charge consisted of a $16.5 million goodwill impairment, which eliminated the remaining goodwill in the tubular and pipe products segment, and a partial impairment of $8.0 million related to the segment tradename. The tradename is an indefinitely lived intangible asset with a remaining value of $15.4 million. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a $0.5 million impairment charge, which fully eliminated the goodwill in our specialty metals flat products segment. The following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars shown in thousands): 2015 2014 $ % of net sales $ % of net sales Net sales $ 1,175,543 100.0 $ 1,436,270 100.0 Cost of materials sold (a) 942,214 80.2 1,160,310 80.8 Gross profit (b) 233,329 19.8 275,960 19.2 Operating expenses (c) 236,157 20.1 261,332 18.1 Goodwill and intangible asset impairment (d) 24,951 2.1 23,836 1.7 Operating loss (27,779 ) (2.4 ) (9,208 ) (0.6 ) Other loss, net (125 ) (0.0 ) (126 ) (0.0 ) Interest and other expense on debt 5,690 0.5 6,780 0.5 Loss before income taxes (33,594 ) (2.9 ) (16,114 ) (1.1 ) Income taxes (6,817 ) (0.6 ) 2,950 0.2 Net loss $ (26,777 ) (2.3 ) $ (19,064 ) (1.3 ) (a) Includes $3,347 of LIFO income for 2015 and $365 of LIFO expense for 2014. (b) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (c) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. Excludes goodwill and intangible asset impairment shown separately below for comparability purposes. (d) The non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge is separately displayed for operating expense comparability purposes. $24,451 in 2015 and $23,836 in 2014 of the impairment charge is related to the tubular and pipe products segment and $500 in 2015 is related to the specialty metals flat products segment. Net sales decreased $261 million, or 18.2%, to $1.18 billion in 2015 from $1.44 billion in 2014. Carbon flat products net sales decreased $220 million, or 22.3%, and were 65.1% of total net sales in 2015 compared to 68.6% in 2014. Specialty metals flat products net sales decreased $14.2 million, or 6.9%, and were 16.4% of total net sales in 2015 compared to 14.4% in 2014. Tubular and pipe products net sales decreased $26.9 million, or 11.0%, and were 18.5% of total net sales in 2015 compared to 17.0% of total net sales in 2014. The decrease in sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to a 10.2% decrease in sales volume and an 8.9% decrease in average selling prices in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in tons sold was due to decreased customer demand, specifically in the heavy equipment, agriculture, mining and energy sectors, and lower industry-wide shipments in 2015 compared to 2014. Cost of materials sold decreased $218 million, or 18.8%, to $942 million in 2015 from $1.16 billion in 2014. During 2015, we recorded LIFO income of $3.3 million compared to LIFO expense of $0.4 million recorded in 2014. The decrease in cost of materials sold in 2015 is primarily due to the decreased sales volume of 10.2%, decreased metals costs of 9.6% during 2015 and the impact of LIFO income during 2015 compared to LIFO expense in 2014. 35 As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased to 19.8% in 2015 from 19.2% in 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased in the carbon flat products segment to 19.2% from 18.2% in 2014 and in the tubular and pipe products segment to 32.5% from 28.9% in 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in the specialty metals flat products segment to 8.2% in 2015 from 12.5% in 2014. LIFO income increased gross profit by 0.3% of net sales in 2015 and had no consolidated gross profit impact in 2014. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales during 2015 was primarily due to the cost of materials sold decreasing more than selling prices in the carbon flat rolled and tubular and pipe products segments, as well as the impact of LIFO income in 2015 compared to LIFO expense in 2014. Operating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) decreased $25.2 million, or 9.6%, to $236.2 million in 2015 from $261.3 million in 2014. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 20.1% in 2015 from 18.1% in 2014. Operating expenses decreased in all categories as reported on the Company Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. During 2015, we executed on our profit improvement plan, which contributed to the cost reductions. Distribution expense decreased by $5.2 million, or 12.7%, due to the decreased sales volume. Warehouse and processing costs decreased $6.8 million, or 7.3%, primarily due to reductions in labor and personnel expenses and reduced warehouse consumables expenses related to the 10.2% 2015 volume decrease. Administrative costs decreased by $7.2 million, or 10.0%, primarily related to reductions in labor and personnel expenses, centralization of certain administrative functions, lower variable based incentive compensation and decreases in travel and entertainment expenses. Selling expenses decreased $3.6 million, or 14.7%, as a result of decreased variable compensation associated with fewer sales employees and decreased discretionary spending. Occupancy expenses decreased $0.6 million as a result of decreased heating and snow removal expenses. Depreciation expense decreased $1.7 million, or 8.8%, as a result of certain assets being fully depreciated in 2014. Operating expenses in the carbon flat products segment decreased $19.0 million, operating expenses in the specialty metals products segment decreased $2.4 million, operating expenses in the tubular and pipe products segment decreased $1.8 million, and Corporate expenses decreased $0.9 million. The goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in 2015 included a $16.5 million non-cash goodwill impairment and an $8.0 million intangible asset impairment for the tubular and pipe products segment as well as a $0.5 million goodwill impairment for the specialty metals flat products segment. The 2015 goodwill impairment charges fully impaired the goodwill for both the tubular and pipe products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment. The goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in 2014 included a $23.8 million goodwill impairment for the tubular and pipe products segment. Interest and other expense on debt totaled $5.7 million in 2015 compared to $6.8 million in 2014. Our effective borrowing rate, exclusive of deferred financing fees and commitment fees, was 2.1% in 2015 compared to 2.4% in 2014. The decrease in interest and other expense on debt in 2015 was primarily attributable to lower average borrowings and lower average borrowing rates during 2015 compared to 2014. For 2015, loss before income taxes totaled $33.6 million compared to loss before income taxes of $16.1 million in 2014. 2015 includes goodwill impairment charges of $17.0 million and a $8.0 million intangible asset impairment charge and LIFO income of $3.3 million. 2014 included a goodwill impairment charge of $23.8 million related to the tube and pipe segment and LIFO expense of $0.4 million. An income tax benefit of (20.3%) was recorded for 2015, compared to an income tax provision of 18.3% in 2014. The 2015 and 2014 effective income tax rates were impacted by the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment charges. The income tax benefit for 2015 prior to the goodwill impairment charge was 39.8%. The income tax provision for 2014 prior to the goodwill impairment charge was 38.2%. Net loss for 2015 totaled $26.8 million, or $2.39 per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $19.1 million, or $1.71 per basic and diluted share, for 2014. The goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2015 impacted earnings per share by $1.93 per basic and diluted shares. The goodwill impairment in 2014 impacted earnings per basic and diluted shares by $2.14. 36 Segment Results of Operations Carbon flat products The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the carbon flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data): 2015 2014 % of net sales % of net sales Direct tons sold 935,165 1,059,409 Toll tons sold 102,360 106,725 Total tons sold 1,037,525 1,166,134 Net sales $ 765,400 100.0 $ 985,039 100.0 Average selling price per ton 738 845 Cost of materials sold 618,674 80.8 805,747 81.8 Gross profit (a) 146,726 19.2 179,292 18.2 Operating expenses (b) 153,943 20.1 172,986 17.6 Operating income (loss) $ (7,217 ) (0.9 ) $ 6,306 0.6 (a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (b) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. Tons sold decreased 11.0% to 1.04 million tons in 2015 from 1.17 million tons in 2014. Toll tons sold decreased 4.1% to 102 thousand tons in 2015 from 107 thousand tons in 2014. The decrease in tons sold was due to decreased customer demand, specifically in the heavy equipment, agriculture, mining and energy sectors, and lower industry-wide shipments of carbon flat products in 2015 compared to 2014. Net sales decreased $220 million, or 22.3%, to $765.4 million in 2015 from $985.0 million in 2014. Average selling prices in 2015 decreased 12.7% to $738 per ton, compared to $845 per ton in 2013. The decrease in sales was due to an 11.0% decrease in sales volume and a 12.7% decrease in average selling prices during 2015. The decrease in the average selling price is a result of declining prices in the metals industry during 2015 discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above. Cost of materials sold decreased $187.1 million, or 23.2%, to $618.7 million in 2015 from $805.7 million in 2014. The decrease in cost of materials sold was due to the volume decrease of 11.0% as well as a 13.7% decrease in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2015 compared to 2014. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) increased to 19.2% in 2015 from 18.2% in 2014. The increase in gross profit percentage in 2015 was primarily due to the cost of materials sold decreasing more than selling prices. The average gross profit per ton sold declined to $141 in 2015 from $154 in 2014 due to the significant decline in market prices for metals in 2015. Operating expenses in 2015 decreased $19.0 million, or 11.0%, to $153.9 million from $173.0 million in 2014 mirroring the sales volume decrease of 11.0%. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 20.1% for 2015 from 17.6% in 2014. Operating expenses decreased through reductions in labor and personnel expenses, lower variable based incentive compensation, decreases in travel and entertainment expenses, and lower distribution expense as a result of lower sales volumes. Operating loss for 2015 totaled $7.2 million compared to operating income of $6.3 million in 2014. 37 Specialty metals flat products The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the specialty metals flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data): 2015 2014 % of net sales % of net sales Direct tons sold 72,041 72,917 Toll tons sold 36 45 Total tons sold 72,077 72,962 Net sales $ 192,516 100.0 $ 206,692 100.0 Average selling price per ton 2,671 2,833 Cost of materials sold 176,686 91.8 180,812 87.5 Gross profit (a) 15,830 8.2 25,880 12.5 Operating expenses (b) 16,904 8.8 19,771 9.5 Goodwill impairment charge (c) 500 0.2 - - Operating income (loss) $ (1,574 ) (0.8 ) $ 6,109 3.0 (a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (b) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. Excludes goodwill impairment charge shown separately below for comparability purposes. (c) The non-cash goodwill impairment charge is separately displayed for operating expense comparability purposes. Tons sold decreased 1.2% to 72 thousand tons in 2015 from 73 thousand tons in 2014. The decrease in tons sold was due to decreased customer demand and lower industry wide shipments of stainless and aluminum flat products. Net sales decreased $14.2 million, or 6.9%, to $192.5 million in 2015 from $206.7 million in 2014. Average selling prices in 2015 decreased to $2,671 per ton, compared to $2,833 per ton in 2014. The decrease in sales was due to a 1.2% decrease in sales volume and a 5.7% decrease in the average selling price during 2015. The decrease in the year over year average selling price per ton is a result of declining market price of nickel and aluminum, which continue to pressure stainless and aluminum pricing. Cost of materials sold decreased $4.1 million, or 2.3%, to $176.7 million in 2015 from $180.8 million in 2014. The decrease in cost of materials sold was due to the volume decrease of 1.2% and a 1.1% decrease in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2015 compared to 2014. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) decreased to 8.2% in 2015 from 12.5% in 2014. The average gross profit per ton sold totaled $220 in 2015 compared to $355 per ton in 2014. The decrease in the gross profit percentage is a result of the declining price of nickel, which is a large component of stainless steel and aluminum pricing, and the cost of our material not declining as fast as the average sell price due to slower inventory turns in 2015. Operating expenses (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) decreased $2.9 million, or 14.5%, to $16.9 million in 2015 from $19.8 million in 2014. The decrease in operating expenses exceeded the decrease in sales volume of 1.2%. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 8.8% of net sales in 2015 from 9.5% in 2014. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution and wages decreased as a result of lower sales volumes. Expenses also decreased as a result of the profit improvement plan initiated in 2015 and the decrease in variable performance-based incentive compensation in 2015 compared to 2014. In 2015 we recorded a $0.5 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge as a result of the continued market pressures which fully eliminated the goodwill for the specialty metals flat products segment. Operating loss for 2015 totaled $1.6 million compared to operating income of $6.1 million in 2014. 38 Tubular and pipe products The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the tubular and pipe products segment for 2015 and 2014 (dollars shown in thousands). 2015 2014 % of net sales % of net sales Net sales $ 217,627 100.0 $ 244,539 100.0 Cost of materials sold (a) 146,854 67.5 173,751 71.1 Gross profit (b) 70,773 32.5 70,788 28.9 Operating expenses (c) 58,190 26.8 60,603 24.8 Goodwill and intangible asset impairment (d) 24,451 11.2 23,836 9.7 Operating loss $ (11,868 ) (5.5 ) $ (13,651 ) (5.6 ) (a) Includes $3,347 of LIFO income in 2015 and $365 of LIFO expense in 2014. (b) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (c) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. (d) The non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges are separately displayed for operating expense comparability purposes. Net sales decreased $26.9 million, or 11.0%, to $217.6 million in 2015 from $244.5 million in 2014. The decrease in net sales was due to a 5.7% decrease in the sales volume and a 5.6% decrease in the average selling price during 2015. The decrease in volume was due to decreased customer demand and lower industry-wide shipments of pipe and tube products. Cost of materials sold decreased $26.9 million, or 15.5%, to $146.9 million in 2015 from $173.8 million in 2014. The decrease in cost of materials sold was due to a 5.7% decrease in sales volume and a 10.4% decrease in the average cost of materials sold which was impacted by the LIFO income of $3.3 million in 2015 compared to LIFO expense of $0.4 million in 2014. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased to 32.5% in 2015 from 28.9%, in 2014. The LIFO income recorded in 2015 increased gross profit by 1.5% of net sales and the LIFO expense recorded in 2014, decreased gross profit by 0.2% of net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased as a result of increased value added processing sales and an increase in the product mix to higher margin sales. Operating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) decreased $2.4 million, or 4.0%, to $58.2 million from $60.6 million in 2014. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 26.8% for 2015 compared to 24.8% for 2014. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution and certain selling expenses, decreased as a result of lower sales volume and net sales. Depreciation expense increased as a result of recent investments in processing equipment. In 2015 we recorded a $16.5 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge and an $8.0 million non-cash intangible asset impairment charge. In 2014 we recorded a $23.8 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Operating loss for 2015 totaled $11.9 million, compared to an operating loss of $13.7 million in 2014. The operating loss for 2015 was the result of the goodwill impairment of $16.5 million and the asset impairment charge of $8.0 million. The 2014 operating loss was a result of the $23.8 million goodwill impairment as well as LIFO expense of $0.4 million. Corporate expenses Corporate expenses decreased $0.9 million, or 10.7%, to $7.1 million in 2015 compared to $8.0 million in 2014. The decrease in corporate expenses is primarily attributable to decreases in travel and entertainment expenses and lower variable performance-based compensation in 2015 compared to 2014. Corporate expenses include the unallocated expenses related to managing the entire Company (i.e. all three segments), including compensation for certain personnel, expenses related to being a publicly traded entity such as board of directors expenses, audit expenses, and various other professional fees. 39 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Cash Flows Our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs, purchasing, upgrading and acquiring processing equipment and facilities, making acquisitions and paying dividends. We use cash generated from operations, leasing transactions and borrowings under our credit facility to fund these requirements. We believe that funds available under our credit facility, lease arrangement proceeds and the sale of equity or debt securities, together with funds generated from operations, will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to fund anticipated working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, our dividend payments and share repurchases and any business acquisitions over at least the next 12 months. In the future, we may as part of our business strategy, acquire and dispose of assets or other companies in the same or complementary lines of business, or enter into or exit strategic alliances and joint ventures. Accordingly, the timing and size of our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. 2016 Compared to 2015 Operating Activities During 2016, we used $9.8 million of cash for operations, of which $16.8 million was generated from operating activities and $26.6 million was used for working capital. During 2015, we generated $107.5 million of cash from operations, of which $12.4 million was generated from operating activities and $95.1 million was generated from working capital. Net cash used for operations totaled $16.8 million during 2016 and was primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $19.4 million offset by the net change in long-term assets and liabilities of $1.7 million and the net loss of $1.1 million. Net cash from operations totaled $12.4 million during 2015 and was primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $19.9 million and the non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment of $25.0 million, offset by the net loss of $26.8 million. Working capital at December 31, 2016 totaled $260.0 million, a $28.2 million increase from December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $47.9 million increase in inventory (resulting from increased inventory purchases at the end of 2016), a $9.0 million increase in accounts receivable (resulting primarily from higher sales volume at the end of 2016) offset by a $23.8 million increase in accounts payable and outstanding checks (resulting from the increased inventory purchases at the end of 2016) and a $4.9 million increase in accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities. Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities was $6.4 million during 2016, compared to $7.3 million during 2015. In 2016 capital expenditures were primarily attributable to additional processing equipment and facilities maintenance. During 2017, we expect our capital spending to approximate our annual depreciation levels of $17 million. Financing Activities In 2016, $17.0 million of cash was generated from financing activities which primarily consisted of $18.8 million of net borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility. In 2015, $100.8 million of cash was used for financing activities which primarily consisted of $98.3 million of net repayments under our ABL facility. In February 2017, our Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share, which is payable on March 15, 2017 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2017. Our Board previously approved 2016 regular quarterly dividends of $0.02 per share, which were paid on each of March 15, 2016, June 15, 2016, September 15, 2016 and December 15, 2016. Dividend distributions in the future are subject to the availability of cash, the $2.5 million annual limitation on cash dividends under our ABL Credit Facility and continuing determination by our Board of Directors that the payment of dividends remains in the best interest of our shareholders. 40 Stock Repurchase Program On October 2, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 550,000 shares of the Company issued and outstanding common stock, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated stock repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, all or some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. Repurchased shares are held in our treasury, or canceled and retired as our Board may determine from time to time. Any repurchases of common stock are subject to the covenants contained in the ABL Credit Facility. Under the ABL Credit Facility, we may repurchase common stock and pay dividends up to $2.5 million in the aggregate during any trailing twelve months without restrictions. Purchases in excess of $2.5 million require us to (i) maintain availability in excess of 25% of the aggregate revolver commitments ($91.3 million at December 31, 2016) or (ii) to maintain availability equal to or greater than 15% of the aggregate revolver commitments ($54.8 million at December 31, 2016) and we must maintain a pro-forma ratio of EBITDA minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to fixed charges of at least 1.00 to 1.00. The timing and amount of any repurchases under the stock repurchase program will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and limitations under the ABL Credit Facility, and repurchases may be discontinued at any time. During 2017, we expect to be limited to the $2.5 million available without restrictions to repurchase common stock and pay dividends. There were no shares repurchased during 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we repurchased 65,283 shares for a total cost of $0.7 million. Debt Arrangements Our ABL Credit Facility is collateralized by our accounts receivable and inventory. The ABL Credit Facility consists of a revolving credit line of $365 million. Revolver borrowings are limited to the lesser of a borrowing base, comprised of eligible receivables and inventories, or $365 million in the aggregate. The ABL Credit Facility matures on June 30, 2019. The ABL Credit Facility requires us to comply with various covenants, the most significant of which include: (i) if any commitments or obligations are outstanding and our availability is less than the greater of $30 million or 10.0% of the aggregate amount of revolver commitments ($36.5 million at December 31, 2016) then we must maintain a ratio of EBITDA minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to fixed charges of at least 1.00 to 1.00 for the most recent twelve fiscal month period; (ii) limitations on dividend payments and stock repurchases; and (iii) restrictions on additional indebtedness. We have the option to borrow under our revolver based on the agent base rate plus a premium ranging from 0.00% to 0.25% or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a premium ranging from 1.25% to 3.00%. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with our covenants and we had approximately $94.3 million of availability under the ABL Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2016, $2.0 million of bank financing fees were included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other long-term assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The financing fees are being amortized over the five-year term of the ABL Credit facility and are included in Interest and other expense on debt on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. We entered into a forward starting fixed rate interest rate hedge that commenced June 2013, in order to eliminate the variability of cash interest payments on $53.2 million of the then outstanding LIBOR-based borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility. The hedge, which matured on June 1, 2016, fixed the rate at 1.21% plus a premium ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%. As part of the CTI acquisition in July 2011, we assumed approximately $5.9 million of Industrial Revenue Bond (IRB) indebtedness. The bond matures in April 2018, with the option to provide principal payments annually on April 1st. On April 1, 2016, we paid an optional principal payment of $0.9 million. Since the IRB is remarketed annually, it is included in Current portion of long-term debt on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest is payable monthly, with a variable rate that resets weekly. As a security for payment of the bonds, we obtained a direct pay letter of credit issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The letter of credit reduces annually by the principal reduction amount. The interest rate at December 31, 2016 was 1.0% for the IRB debt. CTI entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the above IRB. At December 31, 2016, the effect of the swap agreement on the bond was to fix the rate at 3.46%. The swap agreement matures in April 2018, and is reduced annually by the amount of the optional principal payments on the bond. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other parties to the interest rate swap agreement. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. 41 2015 Compared to 2014 Operating Activities During 2015, we generated $107.5 million of cash from operations, of which $12.4 million was generated from operating activities and $95.1 million was generated from working capital. During 2014, we used $39.6 million of cash for operations, of which $25.4 million was generated from operating activities and $65.0 million was used for working capital. Net cash from operations totaled $12.4 million during 2015 and was primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $19.9 million and the non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment of $25.0 million, offset by the net loss of $26.8 million. Net cash from operations totaled $25.4 million during 2014 and was primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $21.8 million and the non-cash goodwill impairment of $23.8 million, offset by the net loss of $19.1 million. Working capital at December 31, 2015 totaled $231.9 million, a $94.8 million decrease from December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $104.5 million decrease in inventory (resulting from decreased inventory purchases and lower metals cost in 2015 compared to 2014) and a $30.9 million decrease in accounts receivable (resulting from lower sales volume and selling prices), offset by a $35.6 million decrease in accounts payable and outstanding checks and a $18.5 million decrease in accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other and accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities is mainly related to the decrease in metals derivatives. Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities was $7.3 million during 2015, compared to $7.8 million during 2014. In 2015, capital expenditures were primarily attributable to additional processing equipment at our flat products (carbon and specialty metals) and tube and pipe products existing facilities. Financing Activities In 2015, $100.8 million of cash was used for financing activities which primarily consisted of $98.3 million of net repayments under our ABL Credit Facility. In 2014, $46.4 million of cash was generated from financing activities, which primarily consisted of $49.2 million of net borrowings under our credit facility, including the payoff of our term loan of $48.9 million upon refinancing and subsequent borrowings under our revolving credit facility, offset by $1.2 million of additional deferred financing fees incurred as part of the June 30, 2014 amendment to the ABL Credit Facility (as defined below). Our Board previously approved 2015 and 2014 regular quarterly dividends of $0.02 per share, which were paid in March, June, September and December of 2015 and 2014. 42 Contractual Obligations The following table reflects our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016: Contractual Obligations Less than More than (amounts in thousands) Total 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Long-term debt obligations (a) $ 166,424 $ 895 $ 165,529 $ - $ - Interest obligations (b) 9,885 3,975 5,910 - - Unrecognized tax positions (c) 40 14 26 - - Other long-term liabilities (d) 10,422 607 5,448 3,078 1,288 Operating leases (e) 26,466 6,634 10,315 6,235 3,282 Total contractual obligations $ 213,237 $ 12,125 $ 187,228 $ 9,313 $ 4,570 (a) See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (b) Future interest obligations are calculated using the debt balances and interest rates in effect on December 31, 2016. (c) See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Classification is based on expected settlement dates and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. (d) Primarily consists of retirement liabilities and deferred compensation payable in future years. (e) See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements An off-balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (a) made guarantees, (b) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (c) any obligation under certain derivative instruments or (d) any obligation under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to a company, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services within a company. Other than operating leases, which are disclosed above, and derivative instruments discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2016, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements. Effects of Inflation Inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits, transportation services, processing equipment, purchased metals, energy and borrowings under our credit facility. General inflation, excluding increases in the price of metals and increased distribution expense, has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years. Critical Accounting Policies This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an on-going basis, we monitor and evaluate our estimates and assumptions. 43 We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance is maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified. Estimations are based upon the application of a historical collection rate to the outstanding accounts receivable balance, which remains fairly level from year to year, and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers, which can fluctuate significantly from year to year. We cannot be certain that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience. We consider all available information when assessing the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts each quarter. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include the costs of the purchased metals, inbound freight, external and internal processing and applicable labor and overhead costs. Costs of our flat product segment inventories, including flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products are determined using the specific identification method. Certain of our tubular and pipe products inventory is stated under the LIFO method. At December 31, 2016, approximately $43.4 million, or 17.1% of consolidated inventory, was reported under the LIFO method of accounting. The cost of the remainder of tubular and pipe product segment inventory is determined using a weighted average rolling first-in, first-out method. Intangible Assets The Company performs an annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets for the tubular and pipe products segment in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant nonperformance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. Management uses judgment to determine whether to use a qualitative analysis or a quantitative fair value measurement for each of the Company reporting units that carry intangible assets. If a quantitative fair value measurement is used, the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow methodology. Management assumptions used for the calculations are based on historical results, projected financial information and recent economic events. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions which could adversely affect the reported value of intangible assets. Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. The Company records an impairment or change in useful life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed. Income Taxes Deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet include, as an offset to the estimated temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts on the consolidated balance sheets, the tax effect of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. If we determine that we will not be able to fully realize a deferred tax asset, we will record a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax asset to its net realizable value. 44 Revenue Recognition For both direct and toll shipments, revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred, which generally occurs upon delivery to our customers. Given the proximity of our customers to our facilities, substantially all of our sales are shipped and received within one day. Sales returns and allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical experience and current estimates and are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. Certain engineered products produced by CTI can take several months to manufacture due to their size and complexity. Substantially all projects are completed within six months. The Company may request advance payments from customers during the production of these products. These payments are included in Other accrued liabilities on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to their short-term nature, the Company uses the units of delivery method to account for these contracts. Revenue for the contracts is recognized when the product is shipped and title of the product transfers to the customers. Revenues for these engineered products accounted for approximately 1.7%, 1.8% and 1.7% of our net sales during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No 2016-15, Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments . This ASU addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (COLIs) (including bank-owned life insurance policies (BOLIs)); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to materially impact the Company consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . This ASU is part of the FASB Simplification Initiative and has been issued to reduce complexity in the presentation of employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to materially impact the Company consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases , which specifies the accounting for leases. The objective is to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease. This ASU introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This ASU is part of the FASB Simplification Initiative and has been issued to reduce complexity in the presentation of deferred taxes. This new guidance eliminates the requirement for entities that present a classified statement of financial position to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent, and instead require that they classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. As a result, each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. However, the guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting within a jurisdiction. Companies are still prohibited from offsetting deferred tax liabilities from one jurisdiction against deferred tax assets of another jurisdiction. This ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The guidance may be applied either prospectively, for all deferred tax assets and liabilities, or retrospectively (i.e., by reclassifying the comparative balance sheet). If applied prospectively, entities are required to include a statement that prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. If applied retrospectively, entities are also required to include quantitative information about the effects of the change on prior periods. The prospective adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2016 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and the prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. 45 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. This ASU is part of the FASB Simplification Initiative and has been issued to reduce the complexity in the presentation of debt issuance costs. This new guidance requires companies to present debt issuance costs the same way they currently present debt discounts, as a direct deduction from the carrying value of that debt liability. The guidance is limited to simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs and does not impact the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs. This ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The amendments of ASU No. 2015-03 must be applied retrospectively, where the balance sheet of each presented individual period is adjusted to indicate the period-specific impact of using the new guidance. The FASB considered that because both debt issuance costs and debt discounts are amortized using the effective interest method, there would be no effect on the income statement upon adoption of the amendments. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2016 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements because it does not apply to revolving credit agreements. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern . This ASU contains new guidance on management responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Management must evaluate whether it is probable that known conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, would raise substantial doubt about the entity ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. If such conditions or events are identified, the standard requires management's mitigation plans to alleviate the doubt or a statement of the substantial doubt about the entity ability to continue as a going concern to be disclosed in the financial statements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this ASU did not impact our consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU is a joint project initiated by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards that will: remove inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements; provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets; provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements; and simplify the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer. As originally proposed, the guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to materially impact the Company consolidated financial statements. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU deferred the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year. 46
