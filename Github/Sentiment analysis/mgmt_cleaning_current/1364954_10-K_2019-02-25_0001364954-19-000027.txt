ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K . In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. See the Note about Forward-Looking Statements for additional information. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K , particularly in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. Overview Chegg is a smarter way to student. As the leading direct-to-student learning platform, we strive to improve educational outcomes by putting the student first in all our decisions. We support students on their journey from high school to college and into their career with tools designed to help them pass their test, pass their class, and save money on required materials. Our services are available online, anytime and anywhere, so we can reach students when they need us most. Students subscribe to our subscription services, which we collectively refer to as Chegg Services. Our primary Chegg Services include Chegg Study, Chegg Writing, Chegg Tutors, and Chegg Math Solver . Our Chegg Study subscription service provides Expert Answers and step-by-step Textbook Solutions, helping students with their course work. When students need help creating citations for their papers, they can use one of our Chegg Writing properties, including EasyBib, Citation Machine, BibMe, and CiteThisForMe . When students need additional help on a subject, they can reach a live tutor online, anytime, anywhere through Chegg Tutors. Our Chegg Math Solver subscription service helps students understand math by providing a step-by-step math solver and calculator. Through our agreements with print textbook partners, we offer Required Materials, which includes an extensive print textbook and eTextbook library for rent and sale, helping students save money compared to the cost of buying new. To deliver services to students, we partner with a variety of third parties. We source print textbooks, eTextbooks, and supplemental materials directly or indirectly from publishers in the United States, including Cengage Learning, Pearson, McGraw Hill, Sage Publications, and MacMillan. In July 2018, we acquired StudyBlue, Inc. (StudyBlue), a content library provider that allows students to create flashcards and their own study materials. In May 2018, we acquired WriteLab, Inc. (WriteLab), an AI-enhanced writing platform, that teaches students grammar, sentence structure, writing style, and offers instant feedback to help students revise, edit, and improve their written work. During the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , we generated net revenues of $321.1 million , $255.1 million and $254.1 million , respectively, and in the same periods had net losses of $14.9 million , $20.3 million and $42.2 million , respectively. We plan to continue to invest in our long-term growth, particularly further investment in the technology that powers our learning platform and the development of additional products and services that serve students. Our strategy for achieving profitability is centered upon our ability to utilize Chegg Services to increase student engagement with our learning platform. We plan to continue to invest in the expansion of our Chegg Services to provide a more compelling and personalized solution and deepen engagement with students. In addition, we believe that the investments we have made to achieve our current scale will allow us to drive increased operating margins over time that, together with increased contributions of Chegg Services, will enable us to accomplish profitability and become cash-flow positive in the long-term. Our ability to achieve these long-term objectives is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including our ability to attract, retain, and increasingly engage the student population, intense competition in our markets, the ability to achieve sufficient contributions to revenue from Chegg Services and other factors described in greater detail in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. We have presented revenues for our two product lines, Chegg Services and Required Materials, based on how students view us and the utilization of our products by them. More detail on our two product lines is discussed in the next two sections titled "Chegg Services" and "Required Materials." 38 Table of Contents Chegg Services Our Chegg Services for students primarily includes Chegg Study, Chegg Writing, Chegg Tutors, and Chegg Math Solver . Students typically pay to access Chegg Services such as Chegg Study on a monthly basis. We also work with leading brands to provide students with discounts, promotions, and other products that, based on student feedback, delight them. In the aggregate, Chegg Services revenues were 79% , 73% and 51% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Required Materials Our Required Materials product line includes a revenue share on the rental and sale of print textbooks, as well as revenues from eTextbooks . We have entered into agreements with partners to provide our customers a wide variety of print textbooks. These agreements have allowed us to reduce and eliminate the capital requirements and operating expenses that were historically incurred to acquire and maintain a print textbook library. As a result, our revenues include a share on the total transaction amount that we earn upon fulfillment of a rental or sale transaction using print textbooks for which our partners have title and risk of loss, as opposed to the total transaction amount. We offer our eTextbooks on a standalone basis or as a rental-equivalent solution and for free to students awaiting the arrival of their print textbook rental for select print textbooks. eTextbooks and supplemental course materials are available from approximately 120 publishers as of December 31, 2018 . We also use our website to rent, sell and source used print textbooks on behalf of our partners. We attract students to our website by offering to buy back their used print textbooks as opposed to selling them back to their campus bookstore. In the aggregate, Required Materials revenues were 21% , 27% , and 49% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Seasonality of Our Business The recognition of revenues from our Chegg Services and eTextbooks are primarily recognized ratably over the term a student subscribes to our Chegg Services or rents an eTextbook. This has generally resulted in our highest revenues and profitability in the fourth quarter as it reflects more days of the academic year. Our variable expenses related to marketing activities remain highest in the first and third quarter such that our profitability may not provide meaningful insight on a sequential basis. As a result of these factors, the most concentrated periods for our revenues and expenses do not necessarily coincide, and comparisons of our historical quarterly operating results on a sequential basis may not provide meaningful insight into our overall financial performance. Components of Results of Operations Net Revenues We recognize revenues from our Chegg Services or Required Materials product lines, net of allowances for refunds or charge backs from our payment processors who process payments from credit cards, debit cards and PayPal. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we no longer recognize rental or sales revenues from the gross amount charged to students for the rental or sale of print textbooks. Instead, our services revenues includes a revenue share of the gross amount that we earn upon our partner's fulfillment of a rental transaction using books for which they have control, including title and risk of loss. Revenues from our Chegg Services product line primarily includes Chegg Study, Chegg Writing, Chegg Tutors, and Chegg Math Solver . Chegg Services are offered to students primarily through weekly or monthly subscriptions, and we recognize revenues ratably over the respective subscription period. Revenues from our Required Materials product line includes a revenue share on the rental and sale of print textbooks, as well as revenues from eTextbooks . The revenue share on the rental and sale of print textbooks is recognized immediately when a book ships to the student. Revenues from the rental of eTextbooks is recognized ratably over the contractual period, generally two to five months. Revenues from the sale of eTextbooks is recognized immediately when the eTextbook sale occurs. When deciding the most appropriate basis for presenting revenues or costs of revenues, both the legal form and substance of the agreement between us and our business partners are reviewed to determine each party respective role in the transaction. Where our role in a transaction is that of principal, revenues are recognized on a gross basis. This requires revenue 39 Table of Contents to comprise the gross value of the transaction billed to the customer, after trade discounts, with any related expenditure charged as a cost of revenues. Where our role in a transaction is that of an agent, revenues are recognized on a net basis with revenues representing the margin earned. In relation to print textbook rental and sale agreements with our partners, we recognize revenues on a net basis based on our role in the transaction as an agent . Cost of Revenues Our cost of revenues consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products and services. Certain cost of revenues, including textbook depreciation expense, the cost of textbooks sold, write-offs and allowances related to the print textbook library, have decreased during 2016 and 2017 as we have completely transitioned the shipping and fulfillment activities related to the rental and sale of print textbooks to Ingram. Cost of revenues primarily consists of publisher content fees for eTextbooks, content amortization expense related to content that we develop or license, including publisher agreements for which we pay one-time license fees for published content, payment processing costs, the payments made to tutors through our Chegg Tutors service, personnel costs and other direct costs related to providing content or services. In addition, cost of revenues includes allocated information technology and facilities costs. Changes in our cost of revenues may be disproportionate to changes in our revenues because unrecoverable costs, such as outbound shipping and other fulfillment and payment processing fees, are expensed in the period they are incurred while our revenues may be recognized ratably over the subscription or rental term. This effect is particularly pronounced in the first and third quarters, corresponding to the beginning of academic terms. Operating Expenses We classify our operating expenses into five categories: research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative, restructuring charges (credits) and gain on liquidation of textbooks. One of the most significant components of our operating expenses is employee-related costs, which include share-based compensation expenses. We expect to continue to hire new employees in order to support our current and anticipated growth. In any particular period, the timing of additional hires could materially affect our operating expenses, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. Our operating expenses also contain information technology expenses such as technology costs to support our research and development, sales and marketing expenses, depreciation on our infrastructure systems, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and outside services. We allocate certain costs to each expense category, including cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative. The allocation is primarily based on the headcount in each group at the end of a period. As our business grows, our operating expenses may increase over time to expand capacity and sustain our workforce. Research and Development Our research and development expenses consist of salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense for employees in our product and web design, engineering and technical teams who are responsible for maintaining our website, developing new products and improving existing products. Research and development costs also include amortization of acquired intangible assets, depreciation expense, technology costs to support our research and development, outside services, and allocated information technology and facilities expenses. We expense substantially all of our research and development expenses as they are incurred. In the past three years, our expenses have increased to support new products and services as well as to expand our infrastructure capabilities to support back-end processes associated with our revenue transactions and internal systems. We intend to continue making significant investments in developing new products and services and enhancing the functionality of existing products and services. Sales and Marketing Our sales and marketing expenses consist of user and advertiser-facing marketing and promotional expenditures through a number of targeted online marketing channels, sponsored search, display advertising, email marketing campaigns and other initiatives. We incur salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expenses for our employees engaged in marketing, business development and sales and sales support functions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and allocated information technology and facilities costs. Our marketing expenses are largely variable; and we tend to incur these in the first and third quarters of the year due to our efforts to target students at the beginning of academic terms. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense. 40 Table of Contents General and Administrative Our general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense for certain executives as well as our finance, legal, human resources and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include outside services, legal and accounting services, depreciation expense, provision for doubtful accounts, and allocated information technology and facilities costs. We have incurred additional costs as we transitioned in 2017 from an emerging growth company to a large accelerated filer including increased audit, legal, regulatory and other related fees. Restructuring Charges (Credits) Restructuring charges (credits) are primarily comprised of severance costs, contract and program termination costs, asset impairments and costs of facility consolidation and closure. Restructuring charges are recorded upon approval of a formal management plan and are included in the operating results of the period in which such plan is approved and the expense becomes estimable. Gain on Liquidation of Textbooks Gain on liquidation of textbooks consists of proceeds we receive from the sale of previously rented print textbooks, through our website or to wholesalers and other channels, offset by the net book value of such textbooks. Our gain on liquidation of textbooks is driven by several factors including age of the books liquidated, the volume of books liquidated at a given point in time and the channel through which we liquidate. When the proceeds received exceed the net book value of the textbooks liquidated, we record a gain on liquidation of textbooks. Interest Expense, Net and Other Income (Expense), Net Interest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense on our debt obligations including the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs related to the notes. Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes consists primarily of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Due to the uncertainty as to the realization of the benefits of our domestic deferred tax assets, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against such assets. We intend to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. 41 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table summarizes our historical consolidated statements of operations (in thousands, except percentage of total net revenues): Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Net revenues: Rental $ % $ % $ 39,837 16 % Services 321,084 100 255,066 100 182,399 72 Sales 31,854 12 Total net revenues 321,084 100 255,066 100 254,090 100 Cost of revenues (1) : Rental 28,637 11 Services 79,996 25 80,175 31 56,206 22 Sales 34,758 14 Total cost of revenues 79,996 25 80,175 31 119,601 47 Gross profit 241,088 75 174,891 69 134,489 53 Operating expenses (1) : Research and development 114,291 36 81,926 32 66,331 26 Sales and marketing 54,714 17 51,240 20 53,949 21 General and administrative 77,714 24 64,411 25 55,372 22 Restructuring charges (credits) 589 1,047 1 (423 ) Gain on liquidation of textbooks (4,766 ) (2 ) (670 ) Total operating expenses 247,308 77 193,858 76 174,559 69 Loss from operations (6,220 ) (2 ) (18,967 ) (7 ) (40,070 ) (16 ) Total interest expense, net and other income (expense), net (7,238 ) (2 ) 486 (468 ) Loss before provision for income taxes (13,458 ) (4 ) (18,481 ) (7 ) (40,538 ) (16 ) Provision for income taxes 1,430 (1 ) 1,802 (1 ) 1,707 (1 ) Net loss $ (14,888 ) (5 )% $ (20,283 ) (8 )% $ (42,245 ) (17 )% (1) Includes share-based compensation expense as follows: Cost of revenues $ 420 $ 316 $ 172 Research and development 17,055 14,333 14,771 Sales and marketing 6,703 5,007 6,124 General and administrative 27,852 18,703 20,718 Total share-based compensation expense $ 52,030 $ 38,359 $ 41,785 42 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 Net Revenues Net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $66.0 million , or 26% , compared to the same period in 2017 . Net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $1.0 million, remaining relatively flat, compared to the same period in 2016. Rental revenues decreased $39.8 million, or 100%, while services revenues increased $72.7 million, or 40%, and sales revenues decreased $31.9 million, or 100%. The following table sets forth our total net revenues for the periods shown for our Chegg Services and Required Materials product lines (in thousands, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Change in 2018 Change in 2017 2018 2017 2016 $ % $ % Chegg Services $ 253,985 $ 185,683 $ 129,335 $ 68,302 37 % $ 56,348 44 % Required Materials 67,099 69,383 124,755 (2,284 ) (3 )% (55,372 ) (44 )% Total net revenues $ 321,084 $ 255,066 $ 254,090 $ 66,018 26 % $ 976 % Chegg Services revenues increased $68.3 million , or 37% , in the year ended December 31, 2018 , compared to the same period in 2017 due to growth in Chegg Study and Chegg Writing. Chegg Services revenues represented 79% and 73% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Required Materials revenues decreased $2.3 million , or 3% , in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 , remaining relatively flat. Required Materials revenues represented 21% and 27% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Chegg Services revenues increased $56.3 million, or 44%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016 due to growth in Chegg Study and Chegg Writing. Chegg Services revenues represented 73% and 51% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Required Materials revenues decreased $55.4 million, or 44%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to our strategic partnership with Ingram. Our Required Materials revenues are comprised of a commission on the total transaction amount that we earn from Ingram rather than recognizing the total rental or sales revenues from transactions using our print textbooks. Required Materials revenues decreased throughout 2017 as we fully transitioned new investments in the print textbook library and logistics and fulfillment for print textbook rental and sale orders to Ingram. Required Materials revenues represented 27% and 49% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Gross margins increased to 75% in the year ended December 31, 2018 , from 69% during the same period in 2017 as a result of the growth in our higher margin Chegg Services revenues. Cost of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $39.4 million, or 33%, compared to the same period in 2016 primarily from Ingram's fulfillment of print textbook rental and sale orders. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in textbook depreciation of $9.3 million, lower order fulfillment costs of $11.3 million, and lower cost of print textbooks sold of $25.3 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher amortization of digital content of $2.6 million, 43 Table of Contents higher payment processing fees of $1.0 million, and higher employee-related expenses of $1.2 million. As a result, gross margins increased to 69% in the year ended December 31, 2017, from 53% during the same period in 2016.

Research and development as a percentage of net revenues were 32% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 26% of net revenues during the same period in 2016. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $3.5 million , or 7% , compared to the same period in 2017 . The increase was primarily attributable to higher employee-related expenses of $1.0 million , higher share-based compensation expense of $1.7 million , and higher marketing expenses of $1.8 million , compared to the same period in 2017 . These decreases were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization of $0.5 million and lower outside services of $0.5 million compared to the same period in 2017 .

Sales and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $2.7 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower employee-related expenses of $2.7 million, lower share-based compensation expense of $1.1 million, and lower marketing expenses of $1.3 million, compared to the same period in 2016. These decreases were partially offset by higher software license fees of $1.3 million and higher outside services of $1.0 million compared to the same period in 2016. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 20% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 21% of net revenues during the same period in 2016. 44 Table of Contents General and Administrative General and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $13.3 million , or 21% , compared to the same period in 2017 . The increase was primarily attributable to higher employee-related expenses of $5.6 million , higher share-based compensation expense of $9.1 million , and higher depreciation and amortization of $0.4 million , compared to the same period in 2017. These increases were partially offset by lower professional fees of $2.3 million , compared to the same period in 2017 . General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 24% during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 25% of net revenues during the same period in 2017 . General and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $9.0 million, or 16%, compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher employee-related expenses of $4.6 million, higher professional fees of $4.1 million primarily the result of the transition to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, implementation of Accounting Standards Codification 606, and legal fees, higher facilities expenses of $1.1 million, and higher office expenses of $1.0 million, compared to the same period in 2016. These increases were partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense of $2.0 million, compared to the same period in 2016. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 25% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 22% of net revenues during the same period in 2016. Restructuring Charges (Credits) Restructuring charges of $0.6 million and $1.0 million recorded during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, were primarily related to our strategic partnership with the National Research Center for College & University Admissions (NRCCUA) which resulted in the termination of employees supporting the sales and account support functions of our marketing services offering and our vacant office space in Georgia that we have not been able to sublease . Restructuring credits of $0.4 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily related to a partial reversal of previously accrued lease termination costs due to our previous subtenant leasing additional space. Gain on Liquidation of Textbooks We did not record a gain on liquidation of textbooks during the year ended December 31, 2018 as we liquidated our remaining inventory of print textbooks during the first quarter of 2017. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we recorded a gain on liquidation of print textbooks of $4.8 million and $0.7 million , respectively, resulting from proceeds received from liquidation of previously rented print textbooks on our website and through various other liquidation channels. Interest Expense, Net and Other Income (Expense), Net The following table sets forth our interest expense, net, and other income (expense), net, for the periods shown (in thousands, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Change in 2018 Change in 2017 2018 2017 2016 $ % $ % Interest expense, net $ (11,225 ) $ (74 ) $ (171 ) $ (11,151 ) n/m $ 97 (57 )% Other income (expense), net 3,987 560 (297 ) 3,427 n/m 857 n/m Total interest expense, net and other income (expense), net $ (7,238 ) $ 486 $ (468 ) $ (7,724 ) n/m $ 954 n/m _______________________________________ n/m - not meaningful Interest expense, net increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 as a result of the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and contractual interest expense related to our April 2018 convertible senior notes offering. Interest expense, net, decreased during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 as a result of replacing our previous expired credit facility with a line of credit that carries a lower interest rate. Other income (expense), net, was a net income during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , primarily attributable to interest earned on investments purchased with the net proceeds from our April 2018 convertible senior notes and 45 Table of Contents 2017 follow-on offerings. Other income (expense), net, was a net expense during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily attributable to the accretion of the deferred cash consideration as a result of our acquisition of Imagine Easy Solutions. Provision for Income Taxes The following table sets forth our provision for income taxes for the periods shown (in thousands, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Change in 2018 Change in 2017 2018 2017 2016 $ % $ % Provision for income taxes $ 1,430 $ 1,802 $ 1,707 $ (372 ) (21 )% $ 95 6 % We recorded an income tax provision of approximately $1.4 million , $1.8 million , and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively, which was primarily due to state and foreign income tax expense and federal and state tax expense related to the tax amortization of acquired indefinite lived intangible assets. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2018 , our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaling $484.1 million , which were held for working capital purposes. The substantial majority of our net revenues are from e-commerce transactions with students, which are settled immediately through payment processors, as opposed to our accounts payable, which are settled based on contractual payment terms with our suppliers. In April 2018, we closed an offering of our 0.25% convertible senior notes (the notes) generating net proceeds of approximately $335.6 million, after deducting the initial purchasers discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The notes mature on May 15, 2023 unless converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms prior to such date. As of December 31, 2018 , we have incurred cumulative losses of $406.6 million from our operations and we expect to incur additional losses in the future. Our operations have been financed primarily by our initial public offering of our common stock (IPO), our 2017 follow-on public offering, our 2018 convertible senior notes offering, and cash generated from operations. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth, our investments in research and development activities, our acquisition of new products and services and our sales and marketing activities. To the extent that existing cash and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to adequately fund our business plans and it could have a negative effect on our business, operating cash flows and financial condition. Most of our cash is held in the United States. As of December 31, 2018 , our foreign subsidiaries held an insignificant amount of cash in foreign jurisdictions. We currently do not intend or foresee a need to repatriate some of these foreign funds however, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we anticipate the U.S. federal impact to be minimal if these foreign funds are repatriated. In addition, based on our current and future needs, we believe our current funding and capital resources for our international operations are adequate. The following table sets forth our cash flows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data: * * Net cash provided by operating activities $ 75,113 $ 51,550 $ 24,262 Net cash used in by investing activities $ (82,549 ) $ (136,234 ) $ (5,963 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 256,418 $ 134,214 $ (8,675 ) * Adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASU 2016-18. See Item 8, Note 2 for more information. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Although we incurred net losses during the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , our net losses were fully offset by non-cash expenditures such as other depreciation and amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, and 46 Table of Contents amortization of debt discount and issuance costs expense. Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $75.1 million . Our net loss of $14.9 million was offset by significant non-cash operating expenses, including other depreciation and amortization expense of $22.8 million , share-based compensation expense of $52.0 million , and the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs expense of $10.5 million . Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $51.6 million.

Our convertible senior notes are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at the carrying amount of $283.7 million as of December 31, 2018 . (2) Represents contractual obligations primarily related to information technology services. (3) Our offices are leased under operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2024 . In addition, our other liabilities include $1.3 million related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2018 . The timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond one year. As a result, this amount is not included in the above table. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through December 31, 2018 , we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that assumptions and estimates of the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue For sales of third-party products, we evaluate whether we are acting as a principal or an agent, and therefore would record the gross sales amount as revenues and related costs or the net amount earned as a revenue share from the sale of third-party products. Our determination is based on our evaluation of whether we control the specified goods or services prior to transferring them to the customer. There are significant judgments involved in determining whether we control the specified goods or services prior to transferring them to the customer including whether we have the ability to direct the use of the good or service and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the good or service. In relation to print textbook rental and sale agreements with our partners, we recognize revenues on a net basis based on our role in the transaction as an agent as we have concluded that we do not control the use of the print textbooks, and therefore record only the revenue share we earn upon the shipment of a print textbook to a student. For the rental or sale of eTextbooks, we have concluded that we control the 48 Table of Contents service, therefore we recognize revenue and cost of revenue on a gross basis ratably over the term the student has access to the eTextbook. Some of our customer arrangements include multiple performance obligations. We have determined these performance obligations qualify as distinct performance obligations, as the customer can benefit from the service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and our promise to transfer the service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. For these arrangements that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price based on the relative standalone selling price method by comparing the standalone selling price (SSP) of each distinct performance obligation to the total value of the contract. We determine the SSP based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the distinct performance obligation when sold separately. If the SSP is not directly observable, we estimate the SSP by considering information such as market conditions, and information about the customer. Our agreements with print textbook partners may include an amount of variable consideration in addition to a fixed revenue share that we earn. This variable consideration can either increase or decrease the total transaction price depending on the nature of the variable consideration. We estimate the amount of variable consideration that we will earn at the inception of the contract, adjusted during each period, and include an estimated amount each period. In determining this estimate, we consider the single most likely amount in a range of possible amounts. This estimated amount of variable consideration requires management to make a judgment based on the forecasted amount of consideration that we expect we will earn as well as the time period in which we can reasonably rely on the accuracy of the forecast. Our estimate of variable consideration is constrained to only include three to four years of estimated variable consideration, based on the date the book was placed in service. This is the amount of variable consideration for which it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur, as the amounts that we could potentially earn in the outer years can change significantly based on factors that are out of our control. If our forecasts are inaccurate, the estimated amount of variable consideration could be inaccurate which could impact our revenue recognition in a given period. Impairment of Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets We assess the impairment of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in determining when to perform an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends or significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. When measuring the recoverability of these assets, we will make assumptions regarding our estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If our estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to impair these assets. We did not record any impairment charges related to acquired intangible assets or other long-live assets during the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 . As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , we had intangible assets, net, of $25.9 million and $21.2 million , respectively and property and equipment, net of $59.9 million and $47.5 million , respectively. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Asset Goodwill and our indefinite lived intangible asset are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test. In our qualitative assessment, we consider factors including economic conditions, industry and market conditions and developments, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. Our qualitative assessment requires management to make judgments based on the factors listed above in our determination of whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. Should we conclude that it is more likely than not that our carrying values have been impaired, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill and our indefinite lived intangible asset exceed our fair value. We have not recognized any impairment of goodwill or our indefinite lived intangible asset since our inception. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , we had goodwill of $149.5 million and $125.3 million , respectively, and an indefinite lived intangible asset related to the internships.com trade name of $3.6 million . Share-based Compensation We measure and recognize share-based compensation expense for all awards made to employees, directors and consultants, including restricted stock units (RSUs), performance-based RSUs (PSUs) and our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) based on estimated fair values. 49 Table of Contents We estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the share-based compensation expense related to our awards. Estimated forfeitures are determined based on historical data and management expectation of exercise behaviors. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover and other factors. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our share-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the share-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the share-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements. Share-based compensation expense recognized related to PSUs is subject to the achievement of performance objectives and requires significant judgment by management in determining the current level of attainment of such performance objectives. Management may consider factors such as the latest revenue forecasts and general business trends in the assessment of whether or not a PSU award will be obtained. Subsequent changes to these considerations may have a material impact on the amount of share-based compensation expense recognized in the period related to PSU awards, which may lead to volatility of share-based compensation expense period-to-period. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our share-based compensation expense on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates, which could materially impact our future share-based compensation expense. Provision for Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. We currently are providing a valuation allowance on domestic deferred tax assets. If or when recognizing deferred tax assets in the future, we will consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. We record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we recognize the tax benefit as the largest amount that is cumulative more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.
