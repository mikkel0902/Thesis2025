Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company has continued to experience negative cash flows from operations and net losses. The Company incurred net losses of approximately $1.4 billion, $724.0 million and $460.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company working capital was $822.2 million at December 31, 2023, which included unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $135.0 million and restricted cash of $1.0 billion. The Company plans to invest a portion of its available cash to expand its current production and manufacturing capacity, construct hydrogen plants, and invest in capital projects. At the time of the issuance of the Company 2023 third quarter Form 10-Q, conditions existed that raised substantial doubt about the Company ability to continue as a going concern. As disclosed in Note 24, Subsequent Events , on January 17, 2024, the Company entered into the At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the Original ATM Agreement ) with B. Riley Securities, Inc. ( B. Riley ), pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, offer and sell through or to B. Riley, as sales agent or principal, shares of the Company common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $1.0 billion. As of February 23, 2024, the Company had offered and sold 77,417,069 shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of approximately $302.1 million under the Original ATM Agreement. On February 23, 2024, the Company and B. Riley entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Original ATM Agreement (the Amendment and, together with the Original ATM Agreement, the ATM Agreement ) to increase the aggregate offering price of shares of the Company common stock available for future issuance under the Original ATM Agreement to $1.0 billion. Under the ATM Agreement, for a period of 18 months, the Company has the right at its sole discretion to direct B. Riley to act on a principal basis and purchase directly from the Company up to $11.0 million of shares of its common stock on any trading day (the Maximum Commitment Advance Purchase Amount ) and up to $55.0 million of shares in any calendar week (the Maximum Commitment Advance Purchase Amount Cap ). On and after June 1, 2024, so long as the Company market capitalization is no less than $1.0 billion, the Maximum Commitment Advance Purchase Amount will remain $11.0 million and the Maximum Commitment Advance Purchase Amount Cap will remain $55.0 million. If the Company market capitalization is less than $1.0 billion on and after June 1, 2024, the Maximum Commitment Advance Purchase Amount will be decreased to $10.0 million and the Maximum Commitment Advance Purchase Amount Cap will be decreased to $30.0 million. The Company believes that its working capital and cash position, together with its right to direct B. Riley to purchase shares directly from the Company under the ATM Agreement, will be sufficient to fund its on-going operations for a period of at least 12 months subsequent to the issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and, as a result, substantial doubt about the Company ability to continue as a going concern no longer exists. 48 Table of Contents The Company significant obligations consisted of the following as of December 31, 2023: Operating and finance leases totaling $355.7 million and $45.6 million, respectively, of which $63.7 million and $9.4 million, respectively, are due within the next 12 months.

SEC Settlement On August 30, 2023, the Company reached a settlement of a civil administrative proceeding with the SEC related to the Company restatement of its previously issued financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and as of and for each of the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, June 30, 2020 and 2019, and September 30, 2020 and 2019. The Company, without admitting or denying the findings, agreed to a cease-and-desist order regarding Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13a-15(a) - (c) thereunder. As part of the settlement, the Company paid a civil monetary penalty to the SEC in the amount of $1.25 million on September 20, 2023. Inflation, Material Availability, and Labor Shortages Most components essential to our business are generally available from multiple sources; however, we believe there are some component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, particularly those suppliers and vendors that supply materials in very limited supply worldwide or supply commodities that have a high degree of volatility, whose loss to us or general unavailability could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial condition. For example, although we believe the recent liquid hydrogen supply challenge to be a transitory issue, we have experienced supply chain issues relating to the availability of hydrogen, including but not limited to suppliers utilizing force majeure provisions under existing contracts, which has negatively impacted the amount of hydrogen we have been able to provide under certain of our supply and other agreements. Furthermore, global commodity pricing has been volatile and has been influenced by political events and worldwide economic trends, which has impacted our sourcing strategies, resulting in adverse impacts on our business and financial condition. We have mitigated and are continuing to mitigate these risks by continuing to diversify our supply chain, including diversifying our global supply chain and implementing alternate system architectures that we expect will allow us to source from multiple fuel cell, electrolyzer stack and air supply component vendors. While we continue to invest in our supply chain to improve its resilience with a focus on automation, dual sourcing of critical components, insourcing and localized manufacturing when feasible, we are also working closely with these vendors and other key suppliers on coordinated product introduction plans, product and sales forecasting, strategic inventories, and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels. However, ongoing changes to, and evolution of, our products designs such as simultaneous design/build efforts and new product serviceability trends, or incorrect forecasting or updates to previously forecasted volumes could present challenges to those strategies despite best efforts in 49 Table of Contents leveraging supplier relationships and capabilities. With respect to production, although cost pressures from global energy prices and inflation have been less volatile than previous years, an increase in cost pressures or a rise in inflation could negatively affect our business again, which could have a pricing impact on our key raw materials. We have a regionally diverse supply chain, and in cases where we have single sourced suppliers (typically due to new technology and products or worldwide shortages due to global demand), we work to engineer alternatives in our product design or develop new supply sources while covering short- and medium-term risks with supply contracts, building up inventory, and development partnerships. However, if we are unable to reduce such inventory, that could tie up working capital. In addition, we have continued discussions with suppliers to modify terms of our supply agreements, which may impact the timing of when we receive shipments of certain supplies or result in other supply chain issues. For example, we have experienced pricing impacts from vendors and suppliers due to the recent fluctuations in interest rates and increases in cost of capital, among other factors. However, we continue to take proactive steps through our supply chain team to limit the impact of supplier challenges generally and we continue to work closely with our suppliers and transportation vendors to ensure availability of products and implement other cost savings initiatives. With respect to our service business, we have experienced inflationary increases in labor, parts and related overhead. This has contributed to the increase in our estimated projected costs to service fuel cell systems and related infrastructure, which resulted in an increase in the provision for loss contracts related to service during 2023. If these trends continue, we may have to record additional service loss provisions in the future. We anticipate bookings and revenue will be uneven in the near-term while we pursue sales opportunities. Additionally, we, as well as our suppliers and vendors, have observed an increasingly competitive labor market. Tight labor markets have resulted in longer times to fill open positions for us and our suppliers and vendors. Increased employee turnover, reassessment of employee responsibilities given current business needs, changes in the availability of our workers as well as labor shortages have resulted in, and could continue to result in, increased costs which could negatively affect our component or raw material purchasing abilities, and in turn, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Results of Operations Our primary sources of revenue are from sales of equipment, related infrastructure and other, services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure, power purchase agreements, and fuel delivered to customers and related equipment. A certain portion of our sales result from acquisitions in legacy markets, which we are working to transition to renewable solutions. Revenue from sales of equipment, related infrastructure and other represents sales of our GenDrive units, GenSure stationary backup power units, cryogenic stationary and on road storage, hydrogen liquefaction systems, electrolyzers and hydrogen fueling infrastructure. Revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure represents revenue earned on our service and maintenance contracts and sales of spare parts. Revenue from power purchase agreements primarily represent payments received from customers who make monthly payments to access the Company GenKey solution. Revenue associated with fuel delivered to customers and related equipment represents the sale of hydrogen to customers that has been purchased by the Company from a third party or generated at our hydrogen production plant.

The Company also had $1.2 million and $0.2 million of consideration held by our paying agent in connection with the Joule and CIS acquisitions, respectively, reported as restricted cash as of December 31, 2023, with a corresponding accrued liability on the Company consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the Company had $11.7 million and $10.8 million in restricted cash as collateral resulting from the Frames acquisition as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Guarantee On May 30, 2023, our joint venture, HyVia, entered into a government grant agreement with Bpifrance. As part of the agreement, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Plug Power France, was required to issue a guarantee to Bpifrance in the amount of 20 million through the end of January 2027. Plug Power France is liable to the extent of the guarantee for sums due to Bpifrance from HyVia under the agreement based on the difference between the total amount paid by Bpifrance and the final amount certified by HyVia and Bpifrance. As part of the agreement, there are certain milestones that HyVia is required to meet, and the nonperformance of these milestones or termination of this agreement could result in this guarantee being called upon. As of December 31, 2023, no payments related to this guarantee have been made by the Company and Plug Power France did not record a liability for this guarantee as the likelihood of the guarantee being called upon is remote as of December 31, 2023. Commitments to equity method investments The Company had the following capital commitments related to its equity method investments as of December 31 as follows (in thousands): 2024 $ 152,672 2025 17,300 Total $ 169,972 Unconditional purchase obligations The Company has entered into certain off balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services ( unconditional purchase obligations ). The Company unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier arrangements, take or pay contracts and service agreements. For certain vendors, the Company unconditional obligation to purchase a minimum quantity of raw materials at an agreed upon price is fixed and determinable; while certain other raw material costs will vary due to product forecasting and future economic conditions. Future payments under non-cancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of December 31, 2023, were as follows (in thousands): 2024 $ 42,125 2025 8,023 2026 8,023 2027 2,638 2028 2029 and thereafter Total 60,809 62 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of and during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition, valuation of inventories, goodwill and intangible assets, valuation of long-lived assets, accrual for service loss contracts, operating and finance leases, allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, unbilled revenue, common stock warrants, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and contingencies. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about (1) the carrying values of assets and liabilities and (2) the amount of revenue and expenses realized that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the following are our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions the Company must make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto. Revenue Recognition The Company enters into contracts that may contain one or a combination of fuel cell systems and infrastructure, installation, maintenance, spare parts, fuel delivery and other support services. Contracts containing fuel cell systems and related infrastructure may be sold directly to customers or provided to customers under a PPA. The Company also enters into contracts that contain electrolyzer stacks, systems, maintenance, and other support services. Furthermore, the Company enters into contracts related to the sales of cryogenic equipment, liquefaction systems and engineered equipment. The Company does not include a right of return on its products other than rights related to standard warranty provisions that permit repair or replacement of defective goods. The Company accrues for anticipated standard warranty costs at the same time that revenue is recognized for the related product, or when circumstances indicate that warranty costs will be incurred, as applicable. Any prepaid amounts would only be refunded to the extent services have not been provided or the fuel cell systems or infrastructure have not been delivered . Revenue is measured based on the transaction price specified in a contract with a customer, subject to the allocation of the transaction price to distinct performance obligations as discussed below. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a product or service to a customer. Promises to the customer are separated into performance obligations and are accounted for separately if they are (1) capable of being distinct and (2) distinct in the context of the contract. The Company considers a performance obligation to be distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources readily available to the customer and the Company promise to transfer the goods or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The Company allocates revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices. Payment terms for sales of fuel cells, infrastructure, and service to customers are typically 30 to 90 days from shipment of the goods. Payment terms on electrolyzer systems are typically based on achievement of milestones over the term of the contract with the customer. Sale/leaseback transactions with financial institutions are invoiced and collected upon transaction closing. Service is prepaid upfront in a majority of the arrangements. The Company does not adjust the transaction price for a significant financing component when the performance obligation is expected to be fulfilled within a year. The Company has issued to each of Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC and Walmart warrants to purchase shares of the Company common stock. The Company presents the provision for common stock warrants within each revenue-related line item on the consolidated statements of operations. This presentation reflects the discount that those common stock warrants represent, and therefore revenue is net of these non-cash charges. The provision of common stock warrants is allocated to the relevant revenue-related line items based upon the expected mix of the revenue for each respective contract. See Note 17, Warrant Transaction Agreements , for more details. 63 Table of Contents Nature of goods and services The following is a description of principal activities from which the Company generates its revenue. (a) Sales of equipment, related infrastructure and other (i) Sales of fuel cell systems, related infrastructure and equipment Revenue from sales of fuel cell systems, related infrastructure, and equipment represents sales of our GenDrive units, GenSure stationary backup power units, as well as hydrogen fueling infrastructure. The Company uses a variety of information sources in determining standalone selling prices for fuel cells systems and the related infrastructure. For GenDrive fuel cells, given the nascent nature of the Company market, the Company considers several inputs, including prices from a limited number of standalone sales as well as the Company negotiations with customers. The Company also considers its costs to produce fuel cells as well as comparable list prices in estimating standalone selling prices. The Company uses applicable observable evidence from similar products in the market to determine standalone selling prices for GenSure stationary backup power units and hydrogen fueling infrastructure. The determination of standalone selling prices of the Company performance obligations requires significant judgment, including periodic assessment of pricing approaches and available observable evidence in the market. Once relative standalone selling prices are determined, the Company proportionately allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation within the customer arrangement based upon standalone selling price. The allocated transaction price related to fuel cell systems and spare parts is recognized as revenue at a point in time which usually occurs upon delivery (and occasionally at time of shipment). Revenue on hydrogen infrastructure installations is generally recognized at the point at which transfer of control passes to the customer, which usually occurs upon customer acceptance of the hydrogen infrastructure. The Company uses an input method to determine the amount of revenue to recognize during each reporting period when such revenue is recognized over time, based on the costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligation. (ii) Sales of electrolyzer systems and solutions Revenue from sales of electrolyzer systems and solutions represents sales of electrolyzer stacks and systems used to generate hydrogen for various applications including mobility, ammonia production, methanol production, power to gas, and other uses. The Company uses a variety of information sources in determining standalone selling prices for electrolyzer systems solutions. Electrolyzer stacks are typically sold on a standalone basis and the standalone selling price is the contractual price with the customer. The Company uses an adjusted market assessment approach to determine the standalone selling price of electrolyzer systems when sold with extended service or other equipment. This includes considering both standalone selling prices of the systems by the Company and available information on competitor pricing on similar products. The determination of standalone selling prices of the Company performance obligations requires judgment, including periodic assessment of pricing approaches and available observable evidence in the market. Once relative standalone selling prices are determined, the Company proportionately allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation within the customer arrangement based upon standalone selling price. Revenue on electrolyzer systems and stacks is generally recognized at the point at which transfer of control passes to the customer, which usually occurs upon title transfer at shipment or delivery to the customer location. In certain instances, control of electrolyzer systems transfers to the customer over time, and the related revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligation is satisfied. We recognize revenue over time when contract performance results in the creation of a product for which we do not have an alternative use and the contract includes an enforceable right to payment in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed. In these instances, we use an input measure (cost-to-total cost or percentage-of-completion method) of progress to determine the amount of revenue to recognize during each reporting period based on the costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligation. Payments received from customers are recorded within deferred revenue and customer deposits in the consolidated balance sheets until control is transferred. The related cost of such product and installation is also deferred as a component of deferred cost of revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until control is transferred. 64 Table of Contents (iii) Sales of cryogenic equipment and other Revenue from sales of cryogenic equipment represents sales of liquefaction system and other cryogenic equipment such as trailers and mobile storage equipment for the distribution of liquefied hydrogen, oxygen, argon, nitrogen and other cryogenic gases. The Company uses a variety of information sources in determining standalone selling prices for liquefaction systems and cryogenic equipment. Liquefaction systems are typically sold on a standalone basis and the standalone selling price is the contractual price with the customer. The Company uses an adjusted market assessment approach to determine the standalone selling price of liquefaction systems when sold with other equipment. This includes considering both standalone selling prices of the systems by the Company and available information on competitor pricing on similar products. The determination of standalone selling prices of the Company performance obligation requires judgment, including periodic assessment of pricing approaches and available observable evidence in the market. Revenue on liquefaction systems is generally recognized over time. Control transfers to the customer over time, and the related revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligation is satisfied. We recognize revenue over time when contract performance results in the creation of a product for which we don t not have an alternative use and the contract includes an enforceable right to payment in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed. In these instances, we use an input measure of progress to determine the amount of revenue to recognize during each reporting period based on the costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligation. Revenue on cryogenic equipment is generally recognized at the point at which transfer of control passes to the customer, which usually occurs upon title transfer at shipment or delivery to the customer location. Payments received from customers are recorded within deferred revenue and customer deposits in the consolidated balance sheets until control is transferred. The related costs of such product and installation is also deferred as a component of deferred cost of revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until control is transferred. (b) Services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure Revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure represents revenue earned on our service and maintenance contracts and sales of spare parts. The Company uses an adjusted market assessment approach to determine standalone selling prices for services. This approach considers market conditions and constraints while maximizing the use of available observable inputs obtained from a limited number of historical standalone service renewal prices and negotiations with customers. The transaction price allocated to services as discussed above is generally recognized as revenue over time on a straight-line basis over the expected service period, as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of routine, recurring maintenance performed throughout the contract period. In substantially all of its transactions, the Company sells extended maintenance contracts that generally provide for a five-to-ten-year service period from the date of product installation in exchange for an up-front payment. Services include monitoring, technical support, maintenance and related services. These services are accounted for as a separate performance obligation, and accordingly, revenue generated from these transactions, subject to the proportional allocation of transaction price, is deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the contract, generally on a straight-line basis. Additionally, the Company may enter into annual service and extended maintenance contracts that are billed monthly. Revenue generated from these transactions is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Costs are recognized as incurred over the term of the contract. When costs are projected to exceed revenues over the life of the extended maintenance contract, an accrual for loss contracts is recorded. Costs are estimated based upon historical experience and consider the estimated impact of the Company cost reduction initiatives, if any. The actual results may differ from these estimates. See Extended Maintenance Contracts below. Extended maintenance contracts generally do not contain customer renewal options. Upon expiration, customers may either negotiate a contract extension or switch to purchasing spare parts and maintaining the fuel cell systems on their own. (c) Power purchase agreements Revenue from PPAs primarily represents payments received from customers who make monthly payments to access the Company GenKey solution. 65 Table of Contents Revenue associated with these agreements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreements as the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits from the Company performance of the services. The customers receive services ratably over the contract term. In conjunction with entering into a PPA with a customer, the Company may enter into a separate transaction with third-party financial institutions in which the Company receives proceeds from the sale/leaseback transactions of the equipment and the sale of future service revenue. The proceeds from the financial institution are allocated between the sale of equipment and the sale of future service revenue based on the relative standalone selling prices of equipment and service. The proceeds allocated to the sale of future services are recognized as finance obligations. The proceeds allocated to the sale of the equipment are evaluated to determine if the transaction meets the criteria for sale/leaseback accounting. To meet the sale/leaseback criteria, control of the equipment must transfer to the financial institution, which requires among other criteria the leaseback to meet the criteria for an operating lease and the Company must not have a right to repurchase the equipment (unless specific criteria are met). These transactions typically meet the criteria for sale/leaseback accounting and accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue on the sale of the equipment, and separately recognizes the leaseback obligations. The Company recognizes an operating lease liability for the equipment leaseback obligation based on the present value of the future payments to the financial institutions that are attributed to the equipment leaseback. The discount rate used to determine the lease liability is the Company incremental borrowing rate. The Company also records a right of use asset which is amortized over the term of the leaseback. Rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the leaseback and is included as a cost of power purchase agreements revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. Certain of the Company transactions with financial institutions do not meet the criteria for sale/leaseback accounting and accordingly, no equipment sale is recognized. All proceeds from these transactions are accounted for as finance obligations. The right of use assets related to these transactions are classified as equipment related to the PPAs and fuel delivered to the customers, net in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company uses its transaction-date incremental borrowing rate as the interest rate for its finance obligations that arise from these transactions. No additional adjustments to the incremental borrowing rate have been deemed necessary for the finance obligations that have resulted from the failed sale/leaseback transactions. In determining whether the sales of fuel cells and other equipment to financial institutions meet the requirements for revenue recognition under sale/leaseback accounting, the Company, as lessee, determines the classification of the lease. The Company estimates certain key inputs to the associated calculations such as: 1) discount rate used to determine the present value of future lease payments, 2) fair value of the fuel cells and equipment, and 3) useful life of the underlying asset(s): ASC Topic 842 requires a lessee to discount its future lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company cannot determine the interest rate implicit in its leases because it does not have access to the lessor estimated residual value or the amount of the lessor deferred initial direct costs. Therefore, the Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate to estimate the discount rate for each lease. Adjustments that considered the Company actual borrowing rate, inclusive of securitization, as well as borrowing rates for companies of similar credit quality were applied in the determination of the incremental borrowing rate. In order for the lease to be classified as an operating lease, the present value of the future lease payments cannot exceed 90% of the fair value of the leased assets. The Company estimates the fair value of the lease assets using the sales prices. In order for a lease to be classified as an operating lease, the lease term cannot exceed 75% (major part) of the estimated useful life of the leased asset. The average estimated useful life of the fuel cells is 10 years, and the average estimated useful life of the hydrogen infrastructure is 20 years. These estimated useful lives are compared to the term of each lease to determine the appropriate lease classification. 66 Table of Contents (d) Fuel delivered to customers and related equipment Revenue associated with fuel delivered to customers represents the sale of hydrogen to customers that has been purchased by the Company from a third party or generated at our hydrogen production plant. The stand-alone selling price is not estimated because it is sold separately and therefore directly observable. The Company purchases hydrogen fuel from suppliers in most cases (and sometimes produces hydrogen onsite) and sells to its customers. Revenue and cost of revenue related to this fuel is recorded as dispensed and is included in the respective fuel delivered to customers and related equipment lines on the consolidated statements of operations. (e) Other revenue Other revenue includes payments received for technical services that include engineering services, program management services, procurement services and operations, testing and validation services with HyVia. The scope of these services includes mutually agreed upon services as may be requested from time to time by HyVia. Other revenue also includes sales of electrolyzer engineering and design services. The scope of these services includes establishing and defining project technical requirements, standards and guidelines as well as assistance in scoping and scheduling of large-scale electrolyzer solutions. Impairment of Goodwill Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on October 31 and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist. The impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying amounts to assess whether impairment exists. We have reviewed the provisions of ASC 350-20 with respect to the criteria necessary to evaluate the number of reporting units that exist. Based on this review, we have concluded that we have one operating segment and one reporting unit. During the annual impairment review process, the Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment over relevant events and circumstances to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or to perform a quantitative assessment. We derive the fair value of our reporting unit using the market approach, which estimates fair value based on the determination of comparable publicly-traded companies and market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from those companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit being valued. The Company compares and reconciles the fair value of the reporting unit to our market capitalization in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair value by reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded. Based on the results of our annual review, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $249.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company stock price declined below book value during the fourth quarter of 2023. Management believes the decline of the stock price was due primarily to missed projections and reduced liquidity. The Company analyses did not indicate impairment of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. See Note 10, Intangible Assets and Goodwill , for further information. Impairment Contract assets During the fourth quarter of 2023, there was a contract asset impairment charge of $2.4 million related to our assessment of recoverability of a customer contract. There was no such impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2022. Other current assets During the second quarter of 2023, there was an other current asset impairment charge of $9.7 million related to the termination of a commercial agreement. There was no such impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2022. 67 Table of Contents Property, equipment, leasehold improvements, and finite-lived intangible assets Long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, leasehold improvements, and finite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In making these determinations, the Company uses certain assumptions, including, but not limited to: (i) estimated fair value of the assets; and (ii) estimated, undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets, which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization, length of service, the asset will be used in the Company operations, and (iii) estimated residual values. Fair value is determined using various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. There was impairment of $3.1 million and $0.8 million of property, equipment, leasehold improvements, or finite-lived intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. PPA Executory Contract Considerations We evaluate PPA assets on a quarterly basis to identify events or changes in circumstances ( triggering events ) that indicate the carrying value of certain assets may not be recoverable. PPA assets that we evaluate include right of use lease assets, equipment deployed to our PPAs, and assets related primarily to our fuel delivery business. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, PPA assets are evaluated to determine if the carrying amounts are recoverable. The determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of assets grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows independent of the cash flows of other groups. For operating assets, the Company has generally determined that the lowest level of identifiable cash flows is based on the customer sites. The assets related primarily to our fuel delivery business are considered to be their own asset group. The cash flows are estimated based on the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group. For assets related to our PPA agreements, we consider all underlying cash inflows related to our contract revenues and cash outflows relating to the costs incurred to service the PPAs. Our cash flow estimates used in the recoverability test, are based upon, among other things, historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future cash flows and operating performance. Development of future cash flows also requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including timing of future expected cash flows, future cost savings initiatives, and determining recovery values. Changes to our key assumptions related to future performance and other economic and market factors could adversely affect the outcome of our recoverability tests and cause more asset groups to be tested for impairment. If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows for a given asset group are less than the carrying amount of the related asset group, an impairment loss is determined by comparing the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset group. The impairment loss is then allocated to the assets in the asset group based on the asset relative carrying amounts. However, assets are not impaired below their then estimated fair values. Fair value is generally determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as well as year-over-year trends in pricing of our new equipment and overall evaluation of our industry and market, as considered necessary. The Company considers these indicators with certain of its own internal indices and metrics in determining fair value in light of the nascent state of the Company market and industry. The estimate of fair value represents our best estimates of these factors and is subject to variability. Changes to our key assumptions related to future performance and other economic and market factors could adversely affect our impairment evaluation. The Company has determined that the assets deployed for certain PPA arrangements, as well as certain assets related to the delivery of fuel to customers, are not recoverable based on the undiscounted estimated future cash flows of the asset group, and an expense of $4.8 million was recorded to impairment on the income statement. However, the estimated fair value of the assets in these asset groups equal or exceed the carrying amount of the assets or otherwise limit the amount of impairment that would have been recognized. The Company has identified the primary source of the losses for certain PPA arrangements to be the maintenance components of the PPA arrangements and the impact of customer 68 Table of Contents warrant non-cash provisions. As the PPA arrangements are considered to be executory contracts and there is no specific accounting guidance that permits loss recognition for these revenue contracts, the Company has not recognized a provision for the expected future losses under these revenue arrangements. The Company expects that it will recognize future losses for these arrangements as it continues its efforts to reduce costs of delivering the maintenance component of these arrangements. The Company has estimated total future revenues and costs for these types of arrangements based on existing contracts and leverage of the related assets. For the future estimates, the Company used service cost estimates for extended maintenance contracts and customer warrant provisions at rates consistent with experience to date. The terms for the underlying estimates vary but the average residual term on the existing contracts is four years. Extended Maintenance Contracts On a quarterly basis, we evaluate any potential losses related to our extended maintenance contracts for fuel cell systems and related infrastructure that has been sold. We measure loss accruals at the customer contract level. The expected revenues and expenses for these contracts include all applicable expected costs of providing services over the remaining term of the contracts and the related unearned net revenue. A loss is recognized if the sum of expected costs of providing services under the contract exceeds related unearned net revenue and is recorded as a provision for loss contracts related to service in the consolidated statements of operations. A key component of these estimates is the expected future service costs. In estimating the expected future service costs, the Company considers its current service cost level and applies judgement related to certain cost saving estimates that have been implemented in the field. The expected future cost savings will be primarily dependent upon the success of the Company initiatives related to increasing stack life and achieving better economies of scale on service labor. If the expected cost saving initiatives are not realized, this will increase the costs of providing services and could adversely affect our estimated contract loss accrual. Further, as we continue to work to improve quality and reliability; however, unanticipated additional quality issues or warranty claims may arise and additional material charges may be incurred in the future. These quality issues could also adversely affect our contract loss accrual. The Company has undertaken and will soon undertake several other initiatives to extend the life and improve the reliability of its equipment. As a result of these initiatives and our additional expectation that the increase in certain costs will abate, the Company believes that its contract loss accrual is sufficient. However, if elevated service costs persist, the Company will adjust its estimated future service costs and increase its contract loss accrual estimate. If actual service costs over the remaining term of existing extended maintenance contracts were 10% more or 10% less than those estimated in the determination of the loss accrual for fuel cell systems and related infrastructure at December 31, 2023, the loss accrual would be approximately $13.8 million higher or $13.8 million lower, respectively. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, and net realizable value. All inventory, including spare parts inventory held at service locations, is not relieved until the customer has received the product, at which time the customer obtains control of the goods. We maintain inventory levels adequate for our short-term needs within the next twelve months based upon present levels of production. An allowance for potential non-saleable inventory due to damaged, excess stock or obsolescence is based upon a detailed review of inventory, past history, and expected usage. The Company's estimate of the reserves utilizes certain inputs and involves judgment. The Company evaluates excess and obsolescence and lower of cost or net realizable value inventory reserves on a quarterly basis and, as necessary, reserves inventory based upon a variety of factors, including historical usage, forecasted usage and sales, product obsolescence, anticipated selling price, and anticipated cost to complete to determine product margin and other factors. We review all contracts related to product lines with projected negative margins that are arranged to be sold at a loss in the future as the basis for a lower of cost or net realizable value adjustment. Common Stock Warrant Accounting The Company accounts for common stock warrants as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the respective warrant agreements. Common stock warrants that meet certain applicable requirements of ASC Subtopic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity Own Equity , and other related guidance, including the ability of the Company to settle the warrants without the issuance of registered shares or the absence of rights of the grantee to require cash settlement, are accounted for as equity instruments. The Company classifies these equity instruments within additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. Common stock warrants accounted for as equity instruments represent the warrants issued to Amazon and Walmart as discussed in Note 17, Warrant Transaction Agreements . The Company adopted FASB ASU 2019-08, 69 Table of Contents Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which requires entities to measure and classify share-based payment awards granted to a customer. In order to calculate warrant charges, the Company used the Black-Scholes pricing model, which required key inputs including volatility and risk-free interest rate and certain unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. The Company estimated the fair value of unvested warrants, considered to be probable of vesting, at the time. Based on that estimated fair value, the Company determined warrant charges, which are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations.
