ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion also should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under the section entitled Risk Factors, Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere herein, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a global biopharmaceutical company on a mission to transform the lives of patients with serious and rare diseases. Our first commercial product, ARIKAYCE (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension), received accelerated approval in the United States (US) on September 28, 2018 for the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen for adult patients with limited or no alternative treatment options in a refractory setting as defined by patients who do not achieve negative sputum cultures after a minimum of 6 consecutive months of a multidrug background regimen therapy. MAC lung disease is a rare and often chronic infection that can cause irreversible lung damage and can be fatal. Our clinical-stage pipeline includes INS1007 and INS1009. INS1007 is a novel oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) with therapeutic potential in non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis and other inflammatory diseases. INS1009 is an inhaled formulation of a treprostinil prodrug that may offer a differentiated product profile for rare pulmonary disorders, including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We have legal entities in the US, Ireland, Germany, France, the United Kingdom (UK), the Netherlands, Japan and Bermuda. We have not generated significant revenue since inception, and through December 31, 2018 , we had an accumulated deficit of $1,282.2 million . We have financed our operations primarily through the public offerings of our equity securities and debt financings. Although it is difficult to predict our future funding requirements, based upon our current operating plan, we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 will enable us to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. We expect that over the next few years we will continue to incur losses from operations due to, among other things, research and development expenses in connection with our ongoing and future clinical trials and expenses related to the commercial launch of ARIKAYCE globally, if approved outside the US. APPROVED PRODUCT - ARIKAYCE ARIKAYCE is our first approved product. Accelerated approval of ARIKAYCE was supported by preliminary data from our CONVERT study, a global Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ARIKAYCE in adult patients with refractory MAC lung disease, using achievement of sputum culture conversion (defined as three consecutive negative monthly sputum cultures) by Month 6 as the primary endpoint. Patients who achieved sputum culture conversion by Month 6 continued in the CONVERT study for an additional 12 months of treatment following the first monthly negative sputum culture in order to assess the durability of culture conversion, as defined by patients that have completed treatment and continued in the CONVERT study off all therapy for three months. The CONVERT study is ongoing. Patients who did not culture convert by Month 6 may have been eligible to enroll in our 312 study, an open-label extension study for these non-converting patients who completed six months of treatment in the CONVERT study. The primary objective of the 312 study was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of ARIKAYCE in combination with a standard multi-drug regimen. The secondary endpoints of the 312 study included evaluating the proportion of subjects achieving culture conversion (defined in the same way as the CONVERT study) by Month 6 and the proportion of subjects achieving culture conversion by Month 12, which was the end of treatment. The 312 study has completed. As a condition of accelerated approval, we must conduct a post-approval confirmatory clinical trial. The required confirmatory trial, which is currently under discussion with the FDA, is proposed to be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess and describe the clinical benefit of ARIKAYCE in patients with MAC lung disease. The trial will evaluate the effect of ARIKAYCE on a clinically meaningful endpoint, as compared to an appropriate control, in the intended patient population of patients with MAC lung disease. Pursuant to the timetable agreed upon with the FDA, the study protocol is expected to be finalized during the first half of 2019, with trial results to be reported by 2024. Continued approval of ARIKAYCE will be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in this study. PIPELINE PROGRESS INS1007 54 Table of Contents INS1007 is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of DPP1, which we licensed from AstraZeneca in October 2016. DPP1 is an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases in neutrophils when they are formed in the bone marrow. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and play an essential role in pathogen destruction and inflammatory mediation. Neutrophils contain the neutrophil serine proteases (including neutrophil elastase, proteinase 3, and cathepsin G) that have been implicated in a variety of inflammatory diseases. In chronic inflammatory lung diseases, neutrophils accumulate in the airways and release active neutrophil serine proteases in excess that cause lung destruction and inflammation. INS1007 may decrease the damaging effects of inflammatory diseases, such as non-CF bronchiectasis, by inhibiting DPP1 and its activation of neutrophil serine proteases. Non-CF bronchiectasis is a progressive pulmonary disorder in which the bronchi become permanently dilated due to chronic inflammation and infection. Currently, there is no cure, and we are not aware of any FDA-approved therapies specifically indicated for non-CF bronchiectasis. The WILLOW Study The WILLOW study is a global phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multi-center clinical study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of INS1007 administered once daily for 24 weeks in subjects with non-CF bronchiectasis. We commenced enrollment in the WILLOW study in December 2017 and we expect to complete enrollment in mid-2019. In addition, we are exploring the potential of INS1007 in various neutrophil-driven inflammatory conditions. INS1009 INS1009 is an investigational inhaled treprostinil prodrug formulation that has the potential to address certain of the current limitations of existing prostanoid therapies. We believe that INS1009 prolongs duration of effect and may provide PAH patients with greater consistency in pulmonary arterial pressure reduction over time. Current inhaled prostanoid therapies must be dosed four to nine times per day for the treatment of PAH. Reducing dose frequency has the potential to ease patient burden and improve compliance. Additionally, we believe that INS1009 may be associated with fewer side effects, including elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, and severity and/or frequency of cough, associated with high initial drug levels and local upper airway exposure when using current inhaled prostanoid therapies. We believe INS1009 may offer a differentiated product profile for rare pulmonary disorders, including PAH, and we are currently evaluating our options to advance its development, including exploring its use as an inhaled dry powder formulation. Other Development Activities Our earlier-stage pipeline includes preclinical compounds that we are evaluating in multiple rare diseases of unmet medical need, including gram positive pulmonary infections in CF, NTM lung disease and refractory localized infections involving biofilm. To complement our internal research and development, we actively evaluate in-licensing and acquisition opportunities for a broad range of rare diseases. KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues Product revenues consist primarily of net sales of ARIKAYCE in the US. In October 2018, we began shipping ARIKAYCE to our customers in the US, which include specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors. We recognize revenue for product received by our customers net of allowances for customer credits, including estimated rebates, chargebacks, prompt pay discounts, returns, service fees, and government rebates, such as Medicaid rebates and Medicare Part D coverage gap reimbursements in the US. We also began recognizing revenue from sales to the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM), which granted ARIKAYCE a Temporary Authorizations for Use (Autorisation Temporaire d'Utilisation or ATU). Cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangible assets) Cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangible assets) consist primarily of direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing of ARIKAYCE sold, including third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, freight, allocation of overhead costs, and inventory adjustment charges, in addition to royalty expenses due to PARI. We began capitalizing inventory upon FDA approval of ARIKAYCE. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses R&D expenses consist of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel serving in our research and development functions, including medical affairs. Expenses also include other internal operating 55 Table of Contents expenses, the cost of manufacturing our drug candidate(s) for clinical study, the cost of conducting clinical studies, and the cost of conducting preclinical and research activities. In addition, our R&D expenses include payments to third parties for the license rights to products in development (prior to marketing approval), such as for INS1007. Our expenses related to manufacturing our drug candidate(s) for clinical study are primarily related to activities at contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) that manufacture our product candidates for our use, including purchases of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Our expenses related to clinical trials are primarily related to activities at contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. Since 2011, we have focused our development activities principally on our proprietary, advanced liposomal technology designed specifically for inhaled therapies. Our development efforts in 2018 and 2017 principally related to the development of ARIKAYCE in NTM lung disease. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses SG&A expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for our non-employee directors and personnel serving in our executive, finance and accounting, legal and compliance, commercial and pre-commercial, corporate development, field sales, information technology, program management and human resource functions. SG&A expenses also include professional fees for legal services, consulting services, including pre-commercial planning activities such as non-branded disease awareness, insurance, board of director fees, tax and accounting services. Amortization of Intangible Assets Upon commercialization of ARIKAYCE, our intangible assets began to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. The fair values assigned to our intangible assets are based on estimates and assumptions we believe are reasonable based on available facts and circumstances. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur that require us to review the assets for impairment. Investment Income and Interest Expense Investment income consists of interest and dividend income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense consists primarily of the accretion of debt discount, contractual interest costs and the amortization of debt issuance costs related to our accretion of debt. Debt discount is accreted, and debt issuance costs are amortized, to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the term of the debt. Our balance sheet reflects debt, net of the debt discount, debt issuance costs paid to the lender, and other third-party costs. Unamortized debt issuance costs associated with extinguished debt are expensed in the period of the extinguishment. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 Overview - Operating Results Our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2018 , included the following: Total revenues of $9.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 , as a result of the fourth quarter launch of ARIKAYCE, following US FDA approval on September 28, 2018; Cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangibles) of $2.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to sales of ARIKAYCE; R&D expenses increased $35.5 million primarily resulting from an increase in external manufacturing expenses and higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in headcount, as compared to the prior year; SG&A expenses increased $89.0 million resulting from higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in headcount, and an increase in consulting fees relating to pre-commercial planning activities in preparation for the launch of ARIKAYCE, as compared to the prior year; Amortization of intangible assets of $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 ; and Interest expense increased $19.5 million from the issuance of $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the Convertible Notes) in January 2018. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $324.3 million , or $4.22 per share basic and diluted, compared with a net loss of $192.6 million , or $2.89 per share basic and diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2017 . 56 Table of Contents Revenues Total revenue consists of net sales of ARIKAYCE, which was approved by the FDA on September 28, 2018 and launched in the US in October 2018. The following table summarizes the sources of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 (in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Net product revenues, US $ 9,265 Net product revenues, France ATU 570 Total revenues $ 9,835 Cost of Product Revenues (excluding amortization of intangibles) Cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangible assets) consist primarily of direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing of ARIKAYCE sold, including third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, freight, allocation of overhead costs, and inventory adjustment charges, in addition to royalty expenses due to PARI. We began capitalizing inventory upon FDA approval of ARIKAYCE. Cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangible assets) was $2.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 . All product costs incurred prior to FDA approval of ARIKAYCE in September 2018 were expensed as R&D expenses. As mentioned above, our cost of product revenues includes certain expenses which are fixed, other expenses that were incurred after FDA approval and royalties based on net sales. We expect our cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangible assets), as a percentage of total revenue, to decrease in 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. R&D Expenses R&D expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were comprised of the following (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, Increase (decrease) 2018 2017 $ % External Expenses Clinical development and research $ 30,287 $ 40,511 $ (10,224 ) (25.2)% Manufacturing 43,824 19,808 24,016 121.2% Regulatory, quality assurance, and medical affairs 12,290 7,308 4,982 68.2% Subtotal external expenses $ 86,401 $ 67,627 $ 18,774 27.8% Internal Expenses Compensation and benefit related expenses $ 38,794 $ 27,689 $ 11,105 40.1% Stock-based compensation 9,395 6,491 2,904 44.7% Other internal operating expenses 10,693 7,942 2,751 34.6% Subtotal internal expenses $ 58,882 $ 42,122 $ 16,760 39.8% Total $ 145,283 $ 109,749 $ 35,534 32.4% R&D expenses increased to $145.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 from $109.7 million in the same period in 2017 . The $35.5 million increase was primarily due to an increase of $24.0 million in external manufacturing expenses, specifically related to: pre-approval purchases of ARIKAYCE raw materials; pre-approval CMO expenses related to ARIKAYCE commercial inventory production; and construction costs relating to the build-out of a third-party CMO production facility. In addition, there was a $11.1 million increase in compensation and related expenses due to an increase in headcount in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the prior year period. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in clinical development and research expenses related to the CONVERT and 312 clinical trials. During the year ended December 31, 2018 , external R&D expenses of $86.4 million consisted of $69.2 million related to ARIKAYCE, $13.9 million related to INS1007, and $3.3 million related to other research expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2017 , external R&D expenses of $67.6 million consisted of $54.6 million related to ARIKAYCE, $10.2 million related to INS1007, and $2.8 million related to other research expenses. 57 Table of Contents SG&A Expenses SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were comprised of the following (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, Increase (decrease) 2018 2017 $ % Compensation and benefit related expenses $ 62,592 $ 23,218 $ 39,374 169.6 % Stock-based compensation 16,845 11,582 5,263 45.4 % Professional fees and other external expenses 70,248 30,700 39,548 128.8 % Facility related and other internal expenses 18,533 13,671 4,862 35.6 % Total SG&A expenses $ 168,218 $ 79,171 $ 89,047 112.5 % SG&A expenses increased to $168.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 from $79.2 million in the same period in 2017 . The $89.0 million increase was primarily due to $39.4 million in higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in headcount, including the hiring of our field force, and $39.5 million in professional fees relating to pre-commercial planning activities in preparation for the launch of ARIKAYCE, including non-branded disease awareness, patient support planning, field operations and other consulting fees. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1.2 million and is comprised of amortization of acquired ARIKAYCE R&D and amortization of the milestone paid to PARI for the FDA approval of ARIKAYCE. Interest Expense Interest expense was $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $5.9 million for 2017 . The $19.5 million increase in interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the prior year period relates to the issuance of $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes in January 2018. The interest expense on the Convertible Notes is based on an effective interest rate of 7.6%. Income tax provision (benefit) The income tax provision (benefit) was $0.2 million and $(0.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects the current income tax expense recorded as a result of taxable income in certain of our subsidiaries in Europe and Japan. The income tax (benefit) for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects the reversal of the valuation allowance related to alternative minimum tax (AMT) that we paid in 2009 and became refundable as a result of the Tax Act. On December 22, 2017, the US government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act significantly revised US tax law by, among other provisions, lowering the US federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings, and eliminating or reducing certain income tax deductions. The Tax Act did not have a material impact on our financial statements because our deferred temporary differences are fully offset by a valuation allowance and we did not have any significant offshore earnings from which to record the mandatory transition tax. Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 Net Loss Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $192.6 million, or $2.89 per share basic and diluted, compared with a net loss of $176.3 million, or $2.85 per share basic and diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $16.4 million increase in our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was due to: Decreased R&D expenses of $13.0 million primarily resulting from the $30.0 million upfront payment for the license agreement entered into with AstraZeneca for exclusive global rights to INS1007 in October 2016, offset in part by, an increase in expenses related to the WILLOW study and higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in headcount; and Increased SG&A expenses of $28.5 million resulting from an increase in pre-commercial planning activities, including external consulting expenses, and higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in headcount. 58 Table of Contents In addition, there was a $2.4 million increase in interest expense resulting from the increase in our debt in the second half of 2016. R&D Expenses R&D expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were comprised of the following (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, Increase (decrease) 2017 2016 $ % External Expenses Clinical development and research $ 40,511 $ 35,890 $ 4,621 12.9 % INS1007 license payment 30,000 (30,000 ) (100.0 )% Manufacturing 19,808 17,313 2,495 14.4 % Regulatory, quality assurance, and medical affairs 7,308 4,064 3,244 79.8 % Subtotal external expenses $ 67,627 $ 87,267 $ (19,640 ) (22.5 )% Internal Expenses Compensation and benefit related expenses $ 27,689 $ 22,321 $ 5,368 24.0 % Stock-based compensation 6,491 6,192 299 4.8 % Other internal operating expenses 7,942 6,941 1,001 14.4 % Subtotal internal expenses $ 42,122 $ 35,454 $ 6,668 18.8 % Total $ 109,749 $ 122,721 $ (12,972 ) (10.6 )% R&D expenses decreased to $109.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 from $122.7 million in the same period in 2016. The $13.0 million decrease was due to a $30.0 million upfront payment under the AZ License Agreement related to INS1007 in October 2016 and a $3.7 million decrease in expenses relating to INS1009. These decreases were partially offset by a $10.2 million increase in raw materials purchases and expenses related to the WILLOW trial for INS1007 and a $5.4 million increase in compensation and related expenses due to an increase in headcount. There was also an increase of $3.2 million due to increased regulatory, quality assurance and medical affairs consulting expenses and medical grants. SG&A Expenses SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were comprised of the following (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, Increase (decrease) 2017 2016 $ % Compensation and benefit related expenses $ 23,218 $ 15,550 $ 7,668 49.3 % Stock-based compensation 11,582 11,841 (259 ) (2.2 )% Professional fees and other external expenses 30,700 17,763 12,937 72.8 % Facility related and other internal expenses 13,671 5,525 8,146 147.4 % Total SG&A expenses $ 79,171 $ 50,679 $ 28,492 56.2 % SG&A expenses increased to $79.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 from $50.7 million in the same period in 2016. The $28.5 million increase was due to an increase of $12.9 million in consulting fees relating to pre-commercial planning activities, primarily resulting from a one-time payment in October 2017 related to the buy-down of future royalties payable to PARI on the global net sales of ARIKAYCE, an increase of $7.7 million due to higher compensation costs related to an increase in headcount, and an increase of $8.1 million due to higher facility related expenses. Interest Expense Interest expense was $5.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $3.5 million in the same period in 2016. The $2.4 million increase in interest expense in 2017 relates primarily to an increase in our borrowings from Hercules Capital (Hercules) in September and October of 2016. We entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (A&R Loan Agreement) with Hercules which increased our borrowing capacity by an additional $30.0 million to an aggregate total of $55.0 million. The increase in borrowings under the A&R Loan Agreement was used to fund the upfront payment owed under the AZ License Agreement for the exclusive global rights to INS1007. 59 Table of Contents Income tax (benefit) provision The income tax (benefit) provision was $(0.3) million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The income tax (benefit) for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects the reversal of the valuation allowance related to AMT that we paid in 2009. As a result of the Tax Act, we recorded a noncurrent receivable to reflect the tax amount due to us in future periods relating to a refund due for the prior AMT paid. In addition, the income tax (benefit) provision for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 reflects current income tax expense recorded as a result of taxable income in certain of our subsidiaries in Europe. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview There is considerable time and cost associated with developing potential pharmaceutical products to the point of regulatory approval and commercialization. We commenced commercial shipments of ARIKAYCE in October 2018, and to date, have not generated significant revenue from sales of ARIKAYCE. In recent years, we have funded our operations through public offerings of equity securities and debt financings. In January 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes, including the exercise in full of the underwriter's option to purchase additional Convertible Notes. Our net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of $14.2 million , were $435.8 million . In September 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 14,123,150 shares of our common stock, which included the underwriter exercise in full of its over-allotment option of 1,842,150 shares, at a price to the public of $28.50 per share. Our net proceeds from the sale of the shares, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses of $24.8 million , were $377.7 million . We expect to continue to incur operating losses both in our US and certain international entities, as we plan to fund research and development activities and commercial launch activities for ARIKAYCE. We may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, including the continued commercialization of ARIKAYCE, future clinical trials related to ARIKAYCE, development of INS1007 and INS1009, and the potential development, acquisition, in-license or co-promotion of other products or product candidates that address orphan or rare diseases. We believe we currently have sufficient funds to meet our financial needs for at least the next 12 months. We may opportunistically raise additional capital through equity or debt financing(s), strategic transactions or otherwise. We expect such additional funding, if any, would be used to continue to commercialize ARIKAYCE, to conduct further trials of ARIKAYCE, to develop our product candidates, or to pursue the license or purchase of other technologies or products or product candidates. In 2019, we plan to continue to support the commercial launch of ARIKAYCE in the US, to fund further clinical development of ARIKAYCE and INS1007, and support efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for ARIKAYCE outside the US. Our cash requirements in 2019 will be impacted by a number of factors, the most significant of which are expenses related to the commercialization efforts for ARIKAYCE, and to a lesser extent, expenses related to INS1007 and future ARIKAYCE clinical trials. Cash Flows As of December 31, 2018 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $495.1 million , as compared with $381.2 million as of December 31, 2017 . The $113.9 million increase was due primarily to the net cash proceeds from our issuance of Convertible Notes in January 2018, partially offset by cash used in operating activities and, to a lesser extent, cash used in investing activities. Our working capital was $439.2 million as of December 31, 2018 as compared with $344.8 million as of December 31, 2017 . Net cash used in operating activities was $258.0 million and $159.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The net cash used in operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was primarily for the pre-commercialization efforts and clinical activities related to ARIKAYCE, as well as general and administrative expenses. In addition, net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included commercialization efforts and clinical trial expenses related to INS1007. Net cash used in investing activities was $14.8 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The net cash used in investing activities during 2018 was primarily related to the investment in our long-term production capacity build-out at Patheon. The net cash used in investing activities during 2017 was primarily related to the investment in our long-term production capacity build-out at Patheon and for the build out of our lab facility in Bridgewater, 60 Table of Contents New Jersey. We expect our net cash used in investing activities will increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 as a result of our continuing investment in the build-out of Patheon and our new headquarters facility. Net cash provided by financing activities was $386.7 million and $381.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 included net cash proceeds of $435.8 million from our issuance of Convertible Notes in January 2018 and cash proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by the February 2018 repayment of our outstanding debt to Hercules in the amount of $55.0 million. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2017 included net cash proceeds of $377.7 million from our issuance of 14.1 million shares of common stock in September 2017 and cash proceeds received from stock option exercises. Contractual Obligations In January 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes pursuant to an indenture between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. Our net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of $14.2 million , were approximately $435.8 million . The Convertible Notes bear interest payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2018. The Convertible Notes mature on January 15, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. The Convertible Notes are convertible into common stock of the Company under certain circumstances described in the indenture. For more information, see Note 7 - Debt in our notes to the consolidated financial statements. We have an operating lease for office and laboratory space located in Bridgewater, NJ, our corporate headquarters, for which the initial lease term expires in November 2019. Future minimum rental payments under this lease total approximately $1.0 million . In July 2016, we signed an operating lease for additional laboratory space located in Bridgewater, NJ, for which the initial lease term expires in September 2021, and in October 2018, the Company expanded this lease. Future minimum rental payments under this, and the initial lease, are $3.3 million . In September 2018, we entered into an agreement (the Lease) with Exeter 700 Route 202/206, LLC to lease approximately 117,000 rentable square feet of office space located at 700 Route 202/206, Bridgewater, New Jersey for our future headquarters. Subject to certain conditions, we have the one-time option to expand the leased premises by up to 50,000 rentable square feet, exercisable prior to the fifth anniversary of the Commencement Date (as defined below). The Lease provides for a commencement date of the earlier of (1) September 1, 2019, subject to completion of certain improvements by specified dates, and (2) the date on which we take possession of the premises to commence its business operations therein (the Commencement Date). The initial Lease term runs 130 months from the Commencement Date (plus any partial month from the Commencement Date until the first day of the next full calendar month during the term) and we have the option to extend that term for up to three additional five-year periods. In addition, we are also responsible for operating expenses and taxes pursuant to the Lease. Future minimum payments under the Lease during the initial Lease Term are expected to approximate $32.3 million . The Lease contains customary default provisions, including those relating to payment defaults, performance defaults and events of bankruptcy. In February 2014, we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with Therapure for the manufacture of ARIKAYCE, on a non-exclusive basis, at a 200 kg scale. Pursuant to the agreement, we collaborated with Therapure to construct a production area for the manufacture of ARIKAYCE in Therapure's existing manufacturing facility in Canada. The agreement has an initial term of five years from the first date on which Therapure delivers ARIKAYCE to us after we obtain permits related to the manufacture of ARIKAYCE, and will renew automatically for successive periods of two years each, unless terminated by either party by providing the required two years' prior written notice to the other party. Under the agreement, we are obligated to pay certain minimum amounts for the batches of ARIKAYCE produced each calendar year. In September 2015, we entered into a Commercial Fill/Finish Services Agreement (the Fill/Finish Agreement) with Althea, for Althea to produce, on a non-exclusive basis, ARIKAYCE in finished dosage form at a 50 kg scale. Under the Fill/Finish Agreement, we are obligated to pay a minimum of $2.7 million for the batches of ARIKAYCE produced each calendar year during the term of the Fill/Finish Agreement. The Fill/Finish Agreement became effective as of January 1, 2015, and following an extension in 2018, the agreement remains in effect through December 31, 2021. The Fill/Finish Agreement may be extended for additional two -year periods upon mutual written agreement of the Company and Althea at least one year prior to the expiration of its then-current term. We currently have a licensing agreement with PARI for the use of the optimized Lamira Nebulizer System for delivery of ARIKAYCE in treating patients with NTM lung infections, CF and bronchiectasis. Under the licensing agreement, we have rights under several US and foreign issued patents, and patent applications involving improvements to the optimized Lamira Nebulizer System, to exploit such system with ARIKAYCE for the treatment of such indications, but we cannot manufacture such nebulizers except as permitted under our Commercialization Agreement with PARI. Under the licensing 61 Table of Contents agreement, we paid PARI an upfront license fee and milestone payments. Upon FDA acceptance of our New Drug Application and the subsequent FDA approval of ARIKAYCE, we paid PARI additional milestone payments of 1.0 million and 1.5 million, respectively. In addition, PARI is entitled to receive a future milestone payment of 0.5 million in cash based on achievement of first receipt of marketing approval in a major EU country for ARIKAYCE and the device. In October 2017, we exercised an option to buy-down the royalties payable to PARI, which was included within selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017. PARI is now entitled to receive royalty payments in the mid-single digits on the annual global net sales of ARIKAYCE, pursuant to the licensing agreement, subject to certain specified annual minimum royalties. In July 2014, we entered into a Commercialization Agreement with PARI for the manufacture and supply of the Lamira Nebulizer Systems and related accessories (the Device) as optimized for use with ARIKAYCE. Under the Commercialization Agreement, PARI manufactures the Device except in the case of certain defined supply failures, when the Company will have the right to make the Device and have it made by third parties (but not certain third parties deemed under the Commercialization Agreement to compete with PARI). The Commercialization Agreement has an initial term of 15 years that began in October 2018 (the Initial Term). The term of the Commercialization Agreement may be extended by us for an additional five years by providing written notice to PARI at least one year prior to the expiration of the Initial Term. In October 2017, we entered into certain agreements with Patheon related to the increase of our long-term production capacity for ARIKAYCE. The agreements provide for Patheon to manufacture and supply ARIKAYCE for our anticipated commercial needs. Under these agreements, we are required to deliver to Patheon the required raw materials, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, and certain fixed assets needed to manufacture ARIKAYCE. Patheon's supply obligations will commence once certain technology transfer and construction services are completed. Our manufacturing and supply agreement with Patheon will remain in effect for a fixed initial term, after which it will continue for successive renewal terms unless either we or Patheon have given written notice of termination. The technology transfer agreement will expire when the parties agree that the technology transfer services have been completed. The agreements may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including by either party due to a material uncured breach of the other party or the other party insolvency. These early termination clauses may reduce the amounts due to the relevant parties. The investment in our long-term production capacity build-out, including under the Patheon agreements and related agreements or purchase orders with third parties for raw materials and fixed assets, is estimated to be approximately $60 million. As of December 31, 2018 , future payments under our long-term debt agreements, minimum future payments under non-cancellable leases and minimum future payment obligations are as follows: As of December 31, 2018 Payments Due By Period Total Less than 1 year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Debt obligations Debt maturities $ 450,000 $ $ $ $ 450,000 Contractual interest 51,209 7,875 15,750 15,750 11,834 Capital leases 32,250 244 5,944 4,370 21,692 Operating leases 6,425 2,881 3,543 1 Purchase obligations 86,383 13,029 10,579 7,650 55,125 Total contractual obligations $ 626,267 $ 24,029 $ 35,816 $ 27,771 $ 538,651 This table does not include: (a) any milestone payments which may become payable to third parties under our license and collaboration agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known; (b) the royalty payments specified below, as the amounts of such payments, timing and/or the likelihood of such payments are not known; (c) contracts that are entered into in the ordinary course of business which are not material in the aggregate in any period presented above; and (d) any payments related to the agreements mentioned below. We entered into a services agreement with Syneos Health (Syneos) pursuant to which we retained Syneos to perform implementation and management services in connection with the WILLOW study. We may terminate the services agreement or any work order for any reason and without cause with 30 days' written notice. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach or bankruptcy petition by the other party or, if any approval from a regulatory authority is revoked, suspended or expires without renewal. We anticipate that aggregate costs relating to all work orders for the WILLOW study will be approximately $21 million over the period of the study. 62 Table of Contents In October 2016, we entered into the AZ License Agreement, pursuant to which AstraZeneca granted us exclusive global rights for the purpose of developing and commercializing AZD7986 (which we renamed INS1007). In consideration of the licenses and other rights granted by AstraZeneca, we made an upfront payment of $30.0 million, which was included as research and development expense in the fourth quarter of 2016. We are obligated to make a series of contingent milestone payments to AstraZeneca totaling up to an additional $85.0 million upon the achievement of clinical development and regulatory filing milestones. If we elect to develop INS1007 for a second indication, we will be obligated to make an additional series of contingent milestone payments totaling up to $42.5 million. We are not obligated to make any additional milestone payments for any additional indications. In addition, we have agreed to pay AstraZeneca tiered royalties ranging from a high single-digit to mid-teens on net sales of any approved product based on INS1007 and one additional payment of $35.0 million upon the first achievement of $1 billion in annual net sales. The AZ License Agreement provides AstraZeneca with the option to negotiate a future agreement with us for commercialization of INS1007 in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma. In December 2014, we entered into a services agreement with SynteractHCR, Inc. (Synteract) pursuant to which we retained Synteract to perform implementation and management services in connection with the CONVERT study. We anticipate that aggregate costs relating to all work orders for the CONVERT study will be approximately $48 million over the period of the study. In April 2015, we entered into a work order with Synteract to perform implementation and management services for the completed 312 study. In 2004 and 2009, we entered into research funding agreements with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc. (CFFT) whereby we received $1.7 million and $2.2 million for each respective agreement in research funding for the development of ARIKAYCE. If ARIKAYCE becomes an approved product for certain infections in CF patients or such infections in human pulmonary disease in the US, we will owe a payment to CFFT of up to $13.4 million that is payable over a three-year period after regulatory approval in the US. Furthermore, if certain global sales milestones are met within five years of the drug's commercialization, we would owe additional payments of $3.9 million. Because there is significant development and regulatory risk associated with ARIKAYCE, including with respect to the CF indication, we have not accrued these obligations. Future Funding Requirements We may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, including the continued commercialization of ARIKAYCE, future clinical trials related to ARIKAYCE, development of INS1007 and INS1009, and the potential development, acquisition, in-license or co-promotion of other products or product candidates that address orphan or rare diseases. We expect that our future capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors, including: the timing and cost of our future clinical trials of ARIKAYCE for the treatment of patients with NTM lung infections; the decisions of the EMA, MHLW and PMDA with respect to our applications for marketing approval of ARIKAYCE in Europe and Japan; the costs of activities related to the regulatory approval process and the timing of approvals, if received; the cost of supporting the sales and marketing efforts necessary to support the continued commercial efforts of ARIKAYCE; the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing patent claims; the timing and cost of our anticipated clinical trials, including INS1007 and the related milestone payments due to AstraZeneca; the costs of our manufacturing-related activities; the costs associated with commercializing ARIKAYCE outside the US, if approved; and subject to receipt of marketing approval, the levels, timing and collection of revenue received from sales of approved products, if any, in the future. We have raised $813.5 million in net proceeds from securities offerings since September 2017. We believe we currently have sufficient funds to meet our financial needs for at least the next 12 months. However, our business strategy may require us to raise additional capital at any time through equity or debt financing(s), strategic transactions or otherwise. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, other than operating leases, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. We do not have any interest in special purpose entities, structured finance entities or other variable interest entities. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 63 Table of Contents Preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the US requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported in our consolidated balance sheets and the amounts reported in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss are affected by estimates and assumptions, which are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for revenue recognition, research and development, stock-based compensation, inventory, identifiable intangible assets, and accrued expenses. The accounting policies discussed below are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application involves the most significant judgment. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. For additional accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Revenue Recognition In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606), we recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods or services provided. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contracts with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation. At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are distinct performance obligations. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when or as the performance obligation is satisfied. For all contracts that fall into the scope of ASC 606, we have identified one performance obligation: the delivery of ARIKAYCE to our customers. We did not incur or capitalize any incremental costs associated with obtaining contracts with customers. Product revenues consist primarily of sales of ARIKAYCE in the US. Product revenues are recognized once we perform all five steps mentioned above. In October 2018, we began shipping ARIKAYCE to our customers in the US, which include specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors. We recognize revenues for product received by our customers net of allowances for customer credits, including estimated rebates, chargebacks, prompt pay discounts, returns, service fees, and government rebates, such as Medicaid rebates and Medicare Part D coverage gap reimbursements in the US. Customer credits: Our customers are offered various forms of consideration, including service fees and prompt payment discounts. We anticipate that our customers will earn prompt payment discounts and, therefore, deduct the full amount of these discounts from total gross product revenues when revenues are recognized. Service fees are also deducted from total gross product revenues as they are earned. Rebates: We contract with Medicaid, other government agencies and various private organizations, or collectively, third-party payors, so that ARIKAYCE will be eligible for purchase by, or partial or full reimbursement from, such third-party payors. We estimate the rebates we will provide to third-party payors and deduct these estimated amounts from total gross product revenues at the time the revenues are recognized. Chargebacks: Chargebacks are discounts that occur when certain contracted customers, currently public health service institutions and federal government entities purchasing via the Federal Supply Schedule, purchase directly from our specialty distributor. Contracted customers generally purchase the product at a discounted price and the specialty distributor, in turn, charges back to us the difference between the price they initially paid and the discounted price paid by the contracted customers. We estimate the chargebacks provided to the specialty distributor and deduct these estimated amounts from gross product revenues at the time revenues are recognized. Co-payment assistance: Patients who have commercial insurance and meet certain eligibility requirements may receive co-payment assistance. We accrue a liability for co-payment assistance based on actual program participation and estimates of program redemption using data provided by a third-party administrator. If any, or all, of our actual experience vary from the estimates above, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, affecting revenue in the period of adjustment. In addition, upon US FDA approval of ARIKAYCE, we began recognizing revenue from sales under an ATU program in France. Pursuant to this program, we ship product to pharmacies after receiving requests from physicians for patients in France. We are initiating expanded access programs (EAPs) in Europe and other countries, some of which may be 64 Table of Contents fully reimbursed. EAPs are intended to make products available on a named patient basis before they are commercially available in accordance with local regulations. Research and Development R&D expenses consist of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel serving in our research and development functions, including medical affairs. Expenses also include other internal operating expenses, the cost of manufacturing our drug candidate(s) for clinical study, the cost of conducting clinical studies, and the cost of conducting preclinical and research activities. In addition, our R&D expenses include payments to third parties for the license rights to products in development (prior to marketing approval), such as for INS1007. Our expenses related to manufacturing our drug candidate(s) for clinical study are primarily related to activities at CMOs that manufacture our product candidates for our use, including purchases of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Our expenses related to clinical trials are primarily related to activities at contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. Since 2011, we have focused our development activities principally on our proprietary, advanced technologies designed specifically for inhaled therapies. Our development efforts in 2018 and 2017 principally related to the development of ARIKAYCE in NTM lung disease. Stock-Based Compensation We recognize stock-based compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees and directors based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. The grant-date fair value of the award is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period, which generally equals the vesting period of the award, and if applicable, is adjusted for expected forfeitures. We also grant performance-based stock options to employees. The grant-date fair value of the performance-based stock options is recognized as compensation expense over the implicit service period using the accelerated attribution method once it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. Stock-based compensation expense is included in both R&D expenses and SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. The following table summarizes the assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : 2018 2017 2016 Volatility 66% - 68% 71% - 79% 74% - 77% Risk-free interest rate 2.25% - 2.96% 1.73% - 2.13% 1.00% - 1.90% Dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Expected option term (in years) 5.09 6.25 6.25 For the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the volatility factor was based on our historical volatility during the expected term or since the closing of our merger with Transave, Inc. in December 2010. The risk-free interest rate is based on the US Treasury yield in effect at the date of grant. Estimated forfeitures were based on the actual percentage of option forfeitures since the closing of the Company merger with Transave, Inc. in December 2010 for the year ended December 31, 2016 . Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2017 , estimated forfeitures were based on the actual percentage of option forfeitures over the expected option term. Accrued Expenses We are required to estimate accrued expenses as part of our process of preparing financial statements. This process involves estimating the level of service performed on our behalf and the associated cost incurred in instances where we have not been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. Examples of areas in which subjective judgments may be required include costs associated with services provided by contract organizations for preclinical development, clinical trials and manufacturing of clinical materials. We accrue for expenses associated with these external services by determining the total cost of a given study based on the terms of the related contract as the services are being provided by monitoring the status of the trials and the invoices received from our external service providers. In the case of clinical trials, the estimated cost normally relates to the projected costs of having subjects enrolled in our trials, which we recognize over the estimated term of the trial according to the number of subjects enrolled in the trial on an ongoing basis, beginning with subject enrollment. As actual costs become known to us, we adjust our accruals. To date, the number of clinical trials and related research service agreements has been relatively limited and our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred. New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted 65 Table of Contents In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , which addressed eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. Among the updates, the standard requires debt extinguishment costs to be classified as cash outflows for financing activities. This standard update became effective as of the first quarter of 2018. As a result of the adoption of the standard, in the first quarter of 2018, the Company reported a $2.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the financing activities section of its consolidated statement of cash flows. The Company had no material debt extinguishment costs prior to the first quarter of 2018. The impact of adopting this standard was not material to the Company. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which amended the then-existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We adopted ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018 and the impact of adopting the standard was not material to our consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous generally accepted accounting principles. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (including interim periods within those periods) and early adoption is permitted. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Targeted Improvements to ASC 842 , which provides a new transition option in which an entity initially applies ASU 2016-02 at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. We will use the new transition option and will be also utilizing the package of practical expedients that allows it to not reassess: (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases. We will also use the short-term lease exception for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Additionally, we expect to use the practical expedient that allows us to treat the lease and non-lease components of our leases as a single component. We have identified approximately ten leasing arrangements and estimate the impact on our consolidated balance sheet to be approximately $44.0 million to $49.0 million . There will be no adjustment recognized through retained earnings as a result of adoption. We will adopt ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019, and we are continuing to evaluate the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses which requires financial assets measured at an amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years effective for fiscal years after beginning after December 15, 2019. Different aspects of the guidance require modified retrospective or prospective adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.
