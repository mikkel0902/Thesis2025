Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW We are one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States. As of December 31, 2019 we owned and operated 107 new vehicle franchises ( 88 dealership locations), representing 31 brands of automobiles, and 25 collision centers, in 17 metropolitan markets, within ten states. Our stores offer an extensive range of automotive products and services, including new and used vehicles; parts and service, which include repair and maintenance services, replacement parts, and collision repair service; and finance and insurance products. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , our new vehicle revenue brand mix consisted of 45% imports, 34% luxury, and 21% domestic brands. Our revenues are derived primarily from: (i) the sale of new vehicles; (ii) the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers ("used retail") and to other dealers at auction ("wholesale") (the terms "used retail" and "wholesale" collectively referred to as "used"); (iii) repair and maintenance services, including collision repair, the sale of automotive replacement parts, and the reconditioning of used vehicles (collectively referred to as "parts and service"); and (iv) the arrangement of third-party vehicle financing and the sale of a number of vehicle protection products (defined below and collectively referred to as "F&I"). We evaluate the results of our new and used vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle sold, our parts and service operations based on aggregate gross profit, and our F&I business based on F&I gross profit per vehicle sold. Our continued organic growth is dependent upon the execution of our balanced automotive retailing and service business strategy, the continued strength of our brand mix, and the production and allocation of desirable vehicles from the automobile manufacturers whose brands we sell. Our vehicle sales have historically fluctuated with product availability as well as local and national economic conditions, including consumer confidence, availability of consumer credit, fuel prices, and employment levels. Additionally, our ability to sell certain new and used vehicles can be negatively impacted by a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control and may include manufacturer imposed stop-sales or open safety recalls, primarily due to, but not limited to, vehicle safety concerns or a vehicle's failure to meet environmental related requirements. Further, governmental actions, such as changes in, or the imposition of, tariffs or trade restrictions on imported goods, may adversely affect vehicle sales and depress demand. However, we believe that the impact on our business of any future negative trends in new vehicle sales would be partially mitigated by (i) the expected relative stability of our parts and service operations over the long-term, (ii) the variable nature of significant components of our cost structure, and (iii) our diversified brand and geographic mix. The seasonally adjusted annual rate ("SAAR") of new vehicle sales in the U.S. during 2019 was 17.0 million compared to 17.3 million in 2018 . The automotive retail business continues to benefit from the availability of credit to consumers, strong consumer confidence and historically low unemployment levels. Demand for new vehicles is generally highest during the second, third, and fourth quarters of each year and, accordingly, we expect our revenues to generally be higher during these periods. We typically experience higher sales of luxury vehicles in the fourth quarter, which have higher average selling prices and gross profit per vehicle retailed. Revenues and operating results may be impacted significantly from quarter-to-quarter by changing economic conditions, vehicle manufacturer incentive programs, adverse weather events, or other developments outside our control. Our gross profit margin varies with our revenue mix. Sales of new vehicles generally result in a lower gross profit margin than used vehicle sales, sales of parts and service, and sales of F&I products. As a result, when used vehicle, parts and service, and F&I revenue increase as a percentage of total revenue, we expect our overall gross profit margin to increase. Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses consist primarily of fixed and incentive-based compensation, advertising, rent, insurance, utilities, and other customary operating expenses. A significant portion of our cost structure is variable (such as sales commissions), or controllable (such as advertising), which we believe allows us to adapt to changes in the retail environment over the long-term. We evaluate commissions paid to salespeople as a percentage of retail vehicle gross profit, advertising expense on a per vehicle retailed ("PVR") basis, and all other SG&A expenses in the aggregate as a percentage of total gross profit. We had total available liquidity of $472.9 million as of December 31, 2019 , which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $3.5 million , $132.1 million of funds in our floor plan offset accounts, $190.0 million of availability under our new vehicle floor plan facility that is able to be convert to our revolving credit facility, $47.3 million of availability under our revolving credit facility, and $100.0 million of availability under our used vehicle revolving floor plan facility. For further discussion of our liquidity, please refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. 32 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions, that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates their estimates and assumptions and the effects of any such revisions are reflected in the financial statements, in the period in which they are determined to be necessary. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and understanding our results of operations, based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application. Goodwill and Manufacturer Franchise Rights Goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquired business over the fair market value of its identifiable assets and liabilities. We have determined that, based on how we integrate acquisitions into our business, how the components of our business share resources and interact with one another, and how we review the results of our operations, that we have several geographic market-based operating segments. We have determined that the dealerships in each of our operating segments are components that are aggregated into several geographic market-based reporting units for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, as they (i) have similar economic characteristics, (ii) offer similar products and services (all of our franchised dealerships offer new and used vehicles, parts and service, and arrange for third-party vehicle financing and the sale of insurance products), (iii) have similar customers, (iv) have similar distribution and marketing practices (all of our dealerships distribute products and services through dealership facilities that market to customers in similar ways) and (v) operate under similar regulatory environments. Our only significant identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill, are our rights under franchise agreements with manufacturers, which are recorded at an individual franchise level. The fair value of our manufacturer franchise rights are determined at the acquisition date, by discounting the projected cash flows specific to each franchise. We have determined that manufacturer franchise rights have an indefinite life as there are no economic, contractual or other factors that limit their useful lives, and they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely due to the historically long lives of the manufacturers' brand names. Furthermore, to the extent that any agreements evidencing our manufacturer franchise rights would expire, we expect that we would be able to renew those agreements in the ordinary course of business. We performed quantitative impairment tests as of October 1, 2019, and identified six dealerships with franchise rights carrying values that exceeded their fair values, and as a result, recorded non-cash impairment charges of $7.1 million . We do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives. We review goodwill and manufacturer franchise rights for impairment annually as of October 1 st , or more often if events or circumstances indicate that any impairment may have occurred. We are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill becomes impaired due to decreases in the fair value of our automotive retail business or manufacturer franchise rights become impaired due to decreases in the fair value of our individual franchises. F&I Chargeback Reserves We receive commissions from third-party lending and insurance institutions for arranging customer financing and from the sale of vehicle service contracts, guaranteed asset protection (known as "GAP") debt cancellation, and other insurance to customers (collectively "F&I"). F&I commissions are recorded at the time the associated vehicle is sold. We may be charged back for F&I commissions in the event a contract is prepaid, defaulted upon, or terminated ("chargebacks"). F&I commissions, net of estimated future chargebacks, are included in Finance and Insurance, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. We reserve for chargebacks on finance, insurance, or vehicle service contract commissions received. The reserve is established based on historical operating results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts and is evaluated on a product-by-product basis. Our F&I cash chargebacks for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 were $40.6 million, $37.5 million, and $34.0 million, respectively. Our chargeback reserves were $48.2 million and $44.2 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. Total chargebacks as a percentage of F&I commissions for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , were 13%, 13%, and 12%, respectively. A 100 basis point change in our estimated reserve rate for future chargebacks, would change our finance and insurance chargeback reserve by approximately $3.4 million as of December 31, 2019 . 33 Table of Contents Insurance Reserves We are self-insured for employee medical claims and maintain stop loss insurance for large-dollar individual claims. We have large deductible insurance programs for workers compensation, property and general liability claims. We maintain and review our claim and loss history to assist in assessing our expected future liability for these claims. We also use professional service providers, such as account administrators and actuaries, to help us accumulate and assess this information. Provisions for retained losses and deductibles are made by charges to expense based upon periodic evaluations of the estimated ultimate liabilities on reported and unreported claims. We had $17.0 million and $16.5 million of insurance reserves for incurred and expected employee medical, workers compensation, property, and general liability claims, net of anticipated insurance recoveries, as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. Expenses associated with employee medical, workers compensation, property, and general liability claims, including premiums for insurance coverage, for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , totaled $33.3 million, $29.9 million, and $27.9 million, respectively. 34 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018 For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2019 2018 (Dollars in millions, except per share data) REVENUE: New vehicle $ 3,863.3 $ 3,788.7 $ 74.6 2 % Used vehicle 2,131.6 1,972.4 159.2 8 % Parts and service 899.4 821.0 78.4 10 % Finance and insurance, net 316.0 292.3 23.7 8 % TOTAL REVENUE 7,210.3 6,874.4 335.9 5 % GROSS PROFIT: New vehicle 159.5 165.2 (5.7 ) (3 )% Used vehicle 134.1 129.7 4.4 3 % Parts and service 559.3 515.8 43.5 8 % Finance and insurance, net 316.0 292.3 23.7 8 % TOTAL GROSS PROFIT 1,168.9 1,103.0 65.9 6 % OPERATING EXPENSES: Selling, general, and administrative 799.8 755.8 44.0 6 % Depreciation and amortization 36.2 33.7 2.5 7 % Franchise rights impairment 7.1 3.7 3.4 92 % Other operating expenses (income), net 0.8 (1.1 ) 1.9 (173 )% INCOME FROM OPERATIONS 325.0 310.9 14.1 5 % OTHER EXPENSES (INCOME): Floor plan interest expense 37.9 32.5 5.4 17 % Other interest expense, net 54.9 53.1 1.8 3 % Swap interest expense 0.5 (0.5 ) (100 )% Gain on divestitures (11.7 ) (11.7 ) % Total other expenses, net 81.1 86.1 (5.0 ) (6 )% INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 243.9 224.8 19.1 8 % Income tax expense 59.5 56.8 2.7 5 % NET INCOME $ 184.4 $ 168.0 $ 16.4 10 % Net income per common share Diluted $ 9.55 $ 8.28 $ 1.27 15 % 35 Table of Contents For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 REVENUE MIX PERCENTAGES: New vehicles 53.6 % 55.1 % Used retail vehicles 26.9 % 25.9 % Used vehicle wholesale 2.6 % 2.8 % Parts and service 12.5 % 11.9 % Finance and insurance, net 4.4 % 4.3 % Total revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % GROSS PROFIT MIX PERCENTAGES: New vehicles 13.6 % 15.0 % Used retail vehicles 11.5 % 11.5 % Used vehicle wholesale 0.1 % 0.2 % Parts and service 47.8 % 46.8 % Finance and insurance, net 27.0 % 26.5 % Total gross profit 100.0 % 100.0 % GROSS PROFIT MARGIN 16.2 % 16.0 % SG&A EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS PROFIT 68.4 % 68.5 % Total revenue during 2019 increase d by $335.9 million ( 5% ) compared to 2018 , due to a $74.6 million ( 2% ) increase in new vehicle revenue, a $159.2 million ( 8% ) increase in used vehicle revenue, a $78.4 million ( 10% ) increase in parts and service revenue and a $23.7 million ( 8% ) increase in F&I revenue. The $65.9 million ( 6% ) increase in gross profit during 2019 was the result of a $4.4 million ( 3% ) increase in used vehicle gross profit, a $23.7 million ( 8% ) increase in F&I gross profit and a $43.5 million ( 8% ) increase in parts and service gross profit, partially offset by a $5.7 million ( 3% ) decrease in new vehicle gross profit. Our total gross profit margin increase d 20 basis points from 16.0% in 2018 to 16.2% in 2019 . Income from operations during 2019 increase d by $14.1 million ( 5% ) compared to 2018 , primarily due to a $65.9 million ( 6% ) increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $44.0 million ( 6% ) increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses, a $3.4 million increase in franchise rights impairment, a $2.5 million ( 7% ) increase in depreciation and amortization expenses, and a $1.9 million increase in other operating expenses (income), net. Total other expenses (income), net decrease d by $5.0 million in 2019 , primarily due to an $11.7 million increase in gain on divestitures and a $0.5 million decrease in swap interest expense in 2019 , partially offset by a $5.4 million increase in floor plan interest expense, and a $1.8 million increase in other interest expense, net. As a result, income before income taxes increase d by $19.1 million ( 8% ) to $243.9 million in 2019 . The $2.7 million ( 5% ) increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to the 8% increase in income before taxes, partially offset by a 3% decrease associated with a lower effective tax rate. Overall, net income increase d by $16.4 million ( 10% ) from $168.0 million in 2018 to $184.4 million in 2019 . On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASC 842, utilizing the optional transition relief method, which allowed for the effective date of the new leases standard as the date of initial application. Our prior period comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of this accounting standard had a minimal impact on the financial results of the Company for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 . For additional information related to the impacts from the adoption of this update, please refer to Note 18 "Leases" within the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2017-12. This update aligns the recognition and presentation, which are to be applied prospectively, of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements. As a result of the adoption of this update, the Company's swap interest expense is now presented within other interest expense, net. Please refer to Note 14 "Financial Instruments and Fair Value" within the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the Company's interest rate swap agreements. We assess the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit on a same store basis. We believe that our assessment on a same store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial performance and provides relevant information to assess our performance. As such, for the following discussion, same store amounts consist of information from dealerships for 36 Table of Contents identical months in each comparative period, commencing with the first month we owned the dealership. Additionally, amounts related to divested dealerships are excluded from each comparative period.

Same store SG&A expense as a percentage of gross profit remained at 68.4% in both 2018 and 2019 . Depreciation and Amortization Expense The $2.5 million ( 7% ) increase in depreciation and amortization expense during 2019 compared to 2018 , was primarily the result of depreciation associated with dealership acquisitions during 2019 , additional assets placed into service during 2019 , and depreciation expense associated with the purchase of previously leased properties. Franchise rights impairment We assessed our manufacturer franchise rights for impairment by comparing the present value of cash flows attributable to each franchise right to its carrying value. As a result of our impairment testing, we recognized a $7.1 million pretax non-cash charge related to six dealerships for the year ended December 31, 2019 and a $3.7 million charge related to three dealerships for the year ended December 31, 2018. Other Operating Expenses (Income), net Other operating expenses (income), net includes gains and losses from the sale of property and equipment, income derived from lease arrangements, and other non-core operating items. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 , the Company recorded expense of $0.8 million , net, which included a $2.6 million pre-tax loss related to the write-off of fixed assets, partially offset by $1.8 million, net of other non-core operating income. 42 Table of Contents The $1.1 million in other operating income, net for 2018 , is primarily due to a $0.7 million gain resulting from legal settlements and $0.4 million of other non-core operating income. Floor Plan Interest Expense Floor plan interest increase d by $5.4 million ( 17% ) to $37.9 million during 2019 compared to $32.5 million during 2018 , as a result of an increase in LIBOR from which our floor plan interest rate is calculated and increased floor plan borrowings from higher inventory levels during 2019 . Income Tax Expense The $2.7 million ( 5% ) increase in income tax expense was the result of a $19.1 million ( 8% ) increase in income before income taxes, partially offset by a decrease as a result of a lower effective tax rate and an excess tax benefit related to the vesting of share-based awards. Our effective tax decreased from 25.3% in 2018 to 24.4% in 2019 . The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduced state rate attributed to lower apportionment in certain jurisdictions and statutory rate reductions in states in which the Company has significant activity. We expect our effective tax rate to be between 24.5% and 25.5% for 2020.

The $47.1 million ( 4% ) increase in gross profit during 2018 was the result of a $7.8 million ( 6% ) increase in used vehicle gross profit, a $17.1 million ( 6% ) increase in F&I gross profit and a $26.0 million ( 5% ) increase in parts and service gross profit, partially offset by a $3.8 million ( 2% ) decrease in new vehicle gross profit. Our total gross profit margin decreased 40 basis points from 16.4% in 2017 to 16.0% in 2018 , primarily due to margin pressure in our new vehicle and used vehicle business lines. Income from operations during 2018 increased by $23.2 million ( 8% ) compared to 2017 , primarily due to a $47.1 million increase in gross profit and a $2.4 million decrease in other operating (income) expense, net, partially offset by a $26.1 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $1.6 million ( 5% ) increase in depreciation and amortization expense. Total other expenses, net increased by $7.5 million in 2018 , primarily due to a $9.8 million increase in floor plan interest expense in 2018 , partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in swap interest expense and a $0.8 million decrease in other interest expense, net. As a result, income before income taxes increased by $15.7 million ( 8% ) to $224.8 million in 2018 . The $13.2 million ( 19% ) decrease in income tax expense was primarily attributable to the decrease in our effective tax rate from 33.5% in 2017 to 25.3% for 2018. Overall, net income increased by $28.9 million ( 21% ) from $139.1 million in 2017 to $168.0 million in 2018 . On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method for all revenue contracts not completed as of that date and recognized a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. Our prior period comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under accounting standards in effect for that period. The net impact of adopting ASC 606 for the year ended December 31, 2018 was a decrease to net income of $0.1 million. For additional information related to the adoption effects of this new revenue recognition standard, please refer to Note 2 "Revenue Recognition" within the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. We assess the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit on a same store basis. As such, for the following discussion, same store amounts consist of information from dealerships for identical months in each comparative period, commencing with the first month we owned the dealership. Additionally, amounts related to divested dealerships are excluded from each comparative period. 45 Table of Contents New Vehicle For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2018 2017 (Dollars in millions, except for per vehicle data) As Reported: Revenue: Luxury $ 1,235.3 $ 1,200.2 $ 35.1 3 % Import 1,790.2 1,637.4 152.8 9 % Domestic 763.2 723.5 39.7 5 % Total new vehicle revenue $ 3,788.7 $ 3,561.1 $ 227.6 6 % Gross profit: Luxury $ 80.0 $ 78.9 $ 1.1 1 % Import 52.6 56.8 (4.2 ) (7 )% Domestic 32.6 33.3 (0.7 ) (2 )% Total new vehicle gross profit $ 165.2 $ 169.0 $ (3.8 ) (2 )% New vehicle units: Luxury 22,979 22,525 454 2 % Import 62,939 58,685 4,254 7 % Domestic 19,357 18,765 592 3 % Total new vehicle units 105,275 99,975 5,300 5 % Same Store: Revenue: Luxury $ 1,235.3 $ 1,200.2 $ 35.1 3 % Import 1,706.7 1,636.2 70.5 4 % Domestic 740.3 722.2 18.1 3 % Total new vehicle revenue $ 3,682.3 $ 3,558.6 $ 123.7 3 % Gross profit: Luxury $ 80.0 $ 78.9 $ 1.1 1 % Import 49.7 56.7 (7.0 ) (12 )% Domestic 31.7 33.2 (1.5 ) (5 )% Total new vehicle gross profit $ 161.4 $ 168.8 $ (7.4 ) (4 )% New vehicle units: Luxury 22,979 22,525 454 2 % Import 60,010 58,648 1,362 2 % Domestic 18,676 18,727 (51 ) % Total new vehicle units 101,665 99,900 1,765 2 % 46 Table of Contents New Vehicle Metrics For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2018 2017 As Reported: Revenue per new vehicle sold $ 35,989 $ 35,620 $ 369 1 % Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 1,569 $ 1,690 $ (121 ) (7 )% New vehicle gross margin 4.4 % 4.7 % (0.3 )% Luxury: Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 3,481 $ 3,503 $ (22 ) (1 )% New vehicle gross margin 6.5 % 6.6 % (0.1 )% Import: Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 836 $ 968 $ (132 ) (14 )% New vehicle gross margin 2.9 % 3.5 % (0.6 )% Domestic: Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 1,684 $ 1,775 $ (91 ) (5 )% New vehicle gross margin 4.3 % 4.6 % (0.3 )% Same Store: Revenue per new vehicle sold $ 36,220 $ 35,622 $ 598 2 % Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 1,588 $ 1,690 $ (102 ) (6 )% New vehicle gross margin 4.4 % 4.7 % (0.3 )% Luxury: Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 3,481 $ 3,503 $ (22 ) (1 )% New vehicle gross margin 6.5 % 6.6 % (0.1 )% Import: Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 828 $ 967 $ (139 ) (14 )% New vehicle gross margin 2.9 % 3.5 % (0.6 )% Domestic: Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 1,697 $ 1,773 $ (76 ) (4 )% New vehicle gross margin 4.3 % 4.6 % (0.3 )% New vehicle revenue increased by $227.6 million ( 6% ), primarily as a result of a 5% increase in new vehicle units sold and a 1% increase in revenue per new vehicle sold. Same store new vehicle revenue increased by $123.7 million ( 3% ) as a result of increases in new vehicle units and revenue per new vehicle sold. The 2% increase in same store unit sale volume was driven by a 2% increase in both luxury and import units. The 2% increase in same store unit sales slightly exceeded 2018 U.S. new vehicle sales, which increased 1% from 17.2 million in 2017 to 17.3 million in 2018 . Same store new vehicle gross profit in 2018 decreased by $7.4 million ( 4% ), as a result of a 6% decrease in gross profit per new vehicle sold, partially offset by a 2% increase in unit volumes. The 30 basis point decrease in same store new vehicle gross margin from 4.7% in 2017 to 4.4% in 2018 , was primarily attributable to a higher mix of revenue in our import brands, which have traditionally had lower margins than our luxury and domestic brands. In addition, we attribute some of the decrease in gross profit to increased competition created by price transparency and comparability as a result of internet based research and car buying services. 47 Table of Contents Used Vehicle For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2018 2017 (Dollars in millions, except for per vehicle data) As Reported: Revenue: Used vehicle retail revenues $ 1,783.3 $ 1,635.3 $ 148.0 9 % Used vehicle wholesale revenues 189.1 198.8 (9.7 ) (5 )% Used vehicle revenue $ 1,972.4 $ 1,834.1 $ 138.3 8 % Gross profit: Used vehicle retail gross profit $ 127.8 $ 121.1 $ 6.7 6 % Used vehicle wholesale gross profit 1.9 0.8 1.1 138 % Used vehicle gross profit $ 129.7 $ 121.9 $ 7.8 6 % Used vehicle retail units: Used vehicle retail units 82,377 76,929 5,448 7 % Same Store: Revenue: Used vehicle retail revenues $ 1,737.2 $ 1,625.0 $ 112.2 7 % Used vehicle wholesale revenues 185.8 197.7 (11.9 ) (6 )% Used vehicle revenue $ 1,923.0 $ 1,822.7 $ 100.3 6 % Gross profit: Used vehicle retail gross profit $ 124.5 $ 120.4 $ 4.1 3 % Used vehicle wholesale gross profit 2.1 1.2 0.9 75 % Used vehicle gross profit $ 126.6 $ 121.6 $ 5.0 4 % Used vehicle retail units: Used vehicle retail units 79,789 76,285 3,504 5 % Used Vehicle Metrics For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2018 2017 As Reported: Revenue per used vehicle retailed $ 21,648 $ 21,257 $ 391 2 % Gross profit per used vehicle retailed $ 1,551 $ 1,574 $ (23 ) (1 )% Used vehicle retail gross margin 7.2 % 7.4 % (0.2 )% Same Store: Revenue per used vehicle retailed $ 21,772 $ 21,302 $ 470 2 % Gross profit per used vehicle retailed $ 1,560 $ 1,578 $ (18 ) (1 )% Used vehicle retail gross margin 7.2 % 7.4 % (0.2 )% Used vehicle revenue increased by $138.3 million ( 8% ), as a result of a 7% increase in used vehicle retail units sold, and a 2% increase in revenue per used vehicle retailed. In 2018 , same store used vehicle retail gross profit increased by $4.1 million ( 3% ). Overall, our gross margin percent decreased from 7.4% in 2017 to 7.2% in 2018 . We primarily attribute the 20 basis point decrease in same store used vehicle retail gross margin to increased competition and price transparency within the used vehicle marketplace. We believe that our used vehicle inventory continues to be well-aligned with current consumer demand, with approximately 34 days of supply as of December 31, 2018 . 48 Table of Contents Parts and Service For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2018 2017 (Dollars in millions) As Reported: Parts and service revenue $ 821.0 $ 786.1 $ 34.9 4 % Parts and service gross profit: Customer pay $ 292.0 $ 272.3 $ 19.7 7 % Warranty 76.8 81.7 (4.9 ) (6 )% Wholesale parts 22.8 21.2 1.6 8 % Parts and service gross profit, excluding reconditioning and preparation $ 391.6 $ 375.2 $ 16.4 4 % Parts and service gross margin, excluding reconditioning and preparation 47.7 % 47.7 % % Reconditioning and preparation * 124.2 114.6 9.6 8 % Total parts and service gross profit $ 515.8 $ 489.8 $ 26.0 5 % Same Store: Parts and service revenue $ 804.1 $ 785.6 $ 18.5 2 % Parts and service gross profit: Customer pay $ 286.2 $ 272.1 $ 14.1 5 % Warranty 75.5 81.7 (6.2 ) (8 )% Wholesale parts 22.3 21.1 1.2 6 % Parts and service gross profit, excluding reconditioning and preparation $ 384.0 $ 374.9 $ 9.1 2 % Parts and service gross margin, excluding reconditioning and preparation 47.8 % 47.7 % 0.1 % Reconditioning and preparation * 121.1 114.3 6.8 6 % Total parts and service gross profit $ 505.1 $ 489.2 $ 15.9 3 % * Reconditioning and preparation represents the gross profit earned by our parts and service departments for internal work performed and is included as a reduction of Parts and service cost of sales within the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income upon the sale of the vehicle. The $34.9 million ( 4% ) increase in parts and service revenue was primarily due to a $30.7 million (6%) increase in customer pay revenue and a $14.4 million (13%) increase in wholesale parts revenue, partially offset by a $10.2 million (7%) decrease in warranty revenue. Same store parts and service revenue increased $18.5 million ( 2% ) from $785.6 million in 2017 to $804.1 million in 2018 . The increase in same store parts and service revenue was due to a $20.2 million (4%) increase in customer pay revenue and a $11.1 million (10%) increase in wholesale parts revenue, partially offset by a $12.8 million (8%) decrease in warranty revenue. Parts and service gross profit, excluding reconditioning and preparation, increased by $16.4 million ( 4% ) to $391.6 million and same store gross profit, excluding reconditioning and preparation, increased by $9.1 million ( 2% ) to $384.0 million . The $9.1 million increase in same store gross profit is primarily due to a $14.1 million ( 5% ) increase in customer pay gross profit partially offset by a $6.2 million ( 8% ) decrease in warranty gross profit. We attribute the increase in same store gross profit to our continued focus on customer retention and the recent trend of increasing new vehicle sales over the past few years. 49 Table of Contents Finance and Insurance, net For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2018 2017 (Dollars in millions, except for per vehicle data) As Reported: Finance and insurance, net $ 292.3 $ 275.2 $ 17.1 6 % Finance and insurance, net per vehicle sold $ 1,558 $ 1,556 $ 2 % Same Store: Finance and insurance, net $ 284.9 $ 274.3 $ 10.6 4 % Finance and insurance, net per vehicle sold $ 1,570 $ 1,557 $ 13 1 % F&I revenue, net increased by $17.1 million ( 6% ) in 2018 when compared to 2017 primarily as a result of a 6% increase in new and used retail unit sales.

Same store SG&A expense as a percentage of gross profit decreased by 50 basis points from 68.9% in 2017 to 68.4% in 2018 . The Company benefited from decreases in rent and share-based compensation expense on both a total company and same store basis. These decreases were partially offset by increases in other expenses including investments in our omni-channel initiatives intended to improve the customer experience and generate long-term operational efficiencies. Depreciation and Amortization Expense The $1.6 million ( 5% ) increase in depreciation and amortization expense during 2018 compared to 2017 , was primarily the result of depreciation associated with the three dealership acquisitions made in 2018, additional assets placed into service during 2017 and 2018 , as well as depreciation expense associated with the purchase of previously leased properties. Franchise rights impairment We assessed our manufacturer franchise rights for impairment by comparing the present value of cash flows attributable to each franchise right to its carrying value. As a result of our impairment testing, we recognized a $3.7 million pretax non-cash charge related to three of our franchises. 51 Table of Contents Other Operating (Income) Expenses, net Other operating (income) expenses, net includes gains and losses from the sale of property and equipment, income derived from lease arrangements, and other non-core operating items. The $1.1 million in other operating income, net for 2018 , is primarily due a $0.7 million gain resulting from legal settlements and $0.4 million of other non-core operating income. The $1.3 million in Other operating expenses, net for 2017, is primarily due to recognized expenses associated with lease terminations of $3.1 million, partially offset by $0.9 million of other income, and $0.9 million gain recognized for legal settlements. Floor Plan Interest Expense The $9.8 million ( 43% ) increase in floor plan interest expense during 2018 compared to 2017 , was primarily the result of higher interest rates throughout 2018 compared with 2017 and, to a lesser extent, higher new vehicle inventory levels. Income Tax Expense The $13.2 million ( 19% ) decrease in income tax expense was the result of a lower effective tax rate due to the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") which reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The decrease in income tax expense was partially offset by a $15.7 million ( 8% ) increase in income before income taxes. Our effective tax rate was 25.3% in 2018 compared to 33.5% in 2017 . During the third quarter of 2018, the IRS released Notice 2018-68, which clarified a number of changes made to Section 162(m) of the Code by the Tax Act. After considering the additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, state tax authorities and other standard-setting bodies we have completed our accounting for the Tax Act. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of December 31, 2019 , we had total available liquidity of $472.9 million , which consisted of $3.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $132.1 million of available funds in our floor plan offset accounts, $190.0 million of availability under our new vehicle floor plan facility that is able to be converted to our revolving credit facility, $47.3 million of availability under our revolving credit facility, and $100.0 million of availability under our used vehicle revolving floor plan facility. The borrowing capacities under our revolving credit facility and our used vehicle revolving floor plan facility are limited by borrowing base calculations and, from time to time, may be further limited by our required compliance with certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2019 , these financial covenants did not further limit our availability under our other credit facilities. For more information on our financial covenants, see "Covenants and Defaults" and "Share Repurchases and Dividend Restrictions" below. We continually evaluate our liquidity and capital resources based upon (i) our cash and cash equivalents on hand, (ii) the funds that we expect to generate through future operations, (iii) current and expected borrowing availability under our 2019 Senior Credit Facility, our other floor plan facilities, our Real Estate Credit Agreement, our Restated Master Loan Agreement, and our mortgage financings (each, as defined below), (iv) amounts in our new vehicle floor plan notes payable offset accounts, and (v) the potential impact of our capital allocation strategy and any contemplated or pending future transactions, including, but not limited to, financings, acquisitions, dispositions, equity and/or debt repurchases, dividends, or other capital expenditures. We believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our debt service and working capital requirements; commitments and contingencies; debt repayment, maturity and repurchase obligations; acquisitions; capital expenditures; and any operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. We currently are party to the following material credit facilities and agreements, and have the following material indebtedness outstanding. For a more detailed description of the material terms of these agreements and facilities, and this indebtedness, refer to the "Long-Term Debt" footnote included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2019 Senior Credit Facility On September 25, 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the 2019 Senior Credit Facility, which amended and restated the Company's pre-existing second amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of July 25, 2016, among the Company and certain of its subsidiaries and Bank of America, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto. The 2019 Senior Credit Agreement provides for the following: Revolving Credit Facility A $250.0 million revolving credit facility for, among other things, acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures, including a $50.0 million sub-limit for letters of credit. As described below, as of December 31, 2019 , we converted $190.0 million of aggregate commitments from the Revolving Credit Facility to our New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility, resulting in $60.0 million of borrowing capacity. In 52 Table of Contents addition, we had $12.7 million in outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2019 , resulting in $47.3 million of borrowing availability as of December 31, 2019 . At our option, we have the ability to re-designate a portion of our availability under our Revolving Credit Facility to the New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility or the Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility. The maximum amount we are allowed to re-designate is determined based on aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, less $50.0 million. In addition, we are able to re-designate any amounts moved to the New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility or Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility back to the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2019 , $190.0 million of availability under our Revolving Credit Facility was re-designated to the New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility. We re-designated this amount to take advantage of the lower commitment fee rates on our New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility when compared to our Revolving Credit Facility. New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility A $1.04 billion New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility. In connection with the New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility, we established an account with Bank of America that allows us to transfer cash as an offset to floor plan notes payable. These transfers reduce the amount of outstanding new vehicle floor plan notes payable that would otherwise accrue interest, while retaining the ability to transfer amounts from the offset account into our operating cash accounts within one to two days. As a result of the use of our floor plan offset account, we experience a reduction in Floor plan interest expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2019 , we had $698.6 million outstanding under our new vehicle floor plan facility, which included $40.9 million classified as Liabilities associated with assets held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and is net of $115.9 million in our floor plan offset account. Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility A $160.0 million Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility to finance the acquisition of used vehicle inventory and for, among other things, working capital and capital expenditures, as well as to refinance used vehicles. Our borrowing capacity under the Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility was limited to $100.0 million , based on our borrowing base calculation as of December 31, 2019 . We began the year with $30.0 million in outstanding borrowings on our used vehicle floor plan facility. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , we had borrowings of $80.0 million and made repayments of $110.0 million, resulting in no outstanding amounts under our Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility as of December 31, 2019 . Subject to compliance with certain conditions, the 2019 Senior Credit Agreement provides that we have the ability, at our option and subject to the receipt of additional commitments from existing or new lenders, to increase the size of the facilities by up to $350.0 million in the aggregate without lender consent. Borrowings under the 2019 Senior Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, based on LIBOR or the Base Rate, in each case plus an Applicable Rate. The Base Rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the Bank of America prime rate, and (iii) one month LIBOR plus 1.00%. Applicable Rate means with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility, a range from 1.00% to 2.00% for LIBOR loans and 0.15% to 1.00% for Base Rate loans, in each case based on the Company's consolidated total lease adjusted leverage ratio. Borrowings under the New Vehicle Floorplan Facility bear interest, at our option, based on LIBOR plus 1.10% or the Base Rate plus 0.10%. Borrowings under the Used Vehicle Floorplan Facility bear interest, at our option, based on LIBOR plus 1.40% or the Base Rate plus 0.40%. In addition to the payment of interest on borrowings outstanding under the 2019 Senior Credit Facility, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on total unused commitments thereunder. The fee for unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility is between 0.15% and 0.40% per year, based on the Company's total lease adjusted leverage ratio, and the fee for unused commitments under the New Vehicle Facility Floor Plan and the Used Vehicle Facility Floor Plan Facility is 0.15% per year. In connection with the Acquisition, we have obtained amendments to our 2019 Senior Credit Agreement (as defined below), among other things, to (1) increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility to $350.0 million, (2) increase the aggregate commitments under the new vehicle floorplan facility to $1.35 billion and (3) increase the aggregate commitments under the used vehicle floorplan facility to $200.0 million. These amendments to increase the aggregate commitments will become effective concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition. In connection with the consummation of the Acquisition, we intend to borrow under the New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility and under the Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility to finance the Park Place vehicle inventory. Manufacturer affiliated new vehicle floor plan and other financing facilities We have a floor plan facility with the Ford Motor Credit Company ("Ford Credit") to purchase new Ford and Lincoln vehicle inventory. This floor plan facility was amended in December 2019 to extend the maturity date from December 5, 2019 to May 31, 2020. We also have established a floor plan offset account with Ford Credit, which operates in a similar manner to our floor plan offset account with Bank of America. As of December 31, 2019 , we had $152.2 million outstanding under our floor 53 Table of Contents plan facility, which included $21.9 million classified as Liabilities associated with assets held for sale and is net of $16.2 million in our floor plan offset account. Additionally, we had $87.0 million , which included $3.1 million classified as Liabilities associated with assets held for sale, outstanding under facilities with certain manufacturers for the financing of loaner vehicles, which were presented within Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Neither our floor plan facility with Ford Credit nor our facilities for loaner vehicles have stated borrowing limitations. The New Senior Notes On February 19, 2020, the Company completed its offering of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $525.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% Senior Notes due 2028 (the 2028 Notes ) and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Senior Notes due 2030 (the 2030 Notes and, together with the 2028 Notes, the Notes ). The 2028 Notes and 2030 Notes mature on March 1, 2028 and March 1, 2030, respectively. Interest is payable semiannually, on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The New Senior Notes were offered, together with additional borrowings and cash on hand, to (i) fund, if consummated, the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Park Place, (ii) redeem all of our outstanding $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024 (the 6.0% Notes ) and (iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing. If (i) the consummation of the Acquisition has not occurred on or before April 30, 2020 (the End Date ) or (ii) we notify the trustee for the Notes of our abandonment or termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement or our determination that the consummation of the Acquisition will not occur on or before the End Date, then we will be required to redeem $525.0 million (the Mandatory Redemption Amount ) aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes and the 2030 Notes on a pro rata basis in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of each series of Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the Mandatory Redemption Amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. The New Senior Notes of each series are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis, by each of our existing and future restricted subsidiaries (including subsidiaries created or acquired as a result of the Acquisition), with certain exceptions. In addition, the New Senior Notes are subject to customary covenants and events of default. The New Senior Notes are required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 within 270 days of the closing date for the offering of the New Senior Notes. 6.0% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024 As of December 31, 2019 we had $600.0 million in aggregate principal amounts outstanding related to our 6.0% Notes. We are required to pay interest on the 6.0% Notes on June 15 and December 15 of each year until maturity on December 15, 2024. On February 3, 2020, we issued a conditional notice of redemption to the holders of our 6.0% Notes, notifying such holders that we intend to redeem all of the Existing Notes on March 4, 2020. The 6.0% Notes will be redeemed at 103% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

These obligations are collateralized by the associated real estate at our dealership locations. 2013 BofA Real Estate Facility As of December 31, 2019 , we had $35.5 million of outstanding borrowings under the 2013 BofA Real Estate Facility.

We will be required to make 27 consecutive quarterly principal payments of 1.25% of the initial amount of each loan, with a balloon repayment of the outstanding principal amount of loans due on the maturity date. The New BofA Real Estate Facility matures seven years from the initial funding date. Borrowings under the New BofA Real Estate Facility are guaranteed by us and each of our operating dealership subsidiaries that lease or own the real estate being financed under the New BofA Real Estate Facility, and are collateralized by first priority liens, subject to certain permitted exceptions, on all of the real property financed thereunder. In connection with the Acquisition, we intend to borrow $216.6 million under the New BofA Real Estate Facility, and have the ability to make one additional draw in an amount up to 80% of the appraised value of the property expected to be acquired at or after the consummation of the Acquisition. Covenants and Defaults We are subject to a number of customary covenants in our various debt and lease agreements, including those described below. We were in compliance with all of our covenants as of December 31, 2019 . Failure to comply with any of our debt covenants would constitute a default under the relevant debt agreements, which would entitle the lenders under such agreements to terminate our ability to borrow under the relevant agreements and accelerate our obligations to repay outstanding borrowings, if any, unless compliance with the covenants were waived. In many cases, defaults under one of our agreements could trigger cross-default provisions in our other agreements.

On January 30, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the Repurchase Program, On October 19, 2018, our Board of Directors reset the authorization under our Repurchase Program to $100.0 million in the aggregate, for the repurchase of our common stock in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions, from time to time. During 2019 , we repurchased 202,379 shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program for a total of $15.3 million . As of 56 Table of Contents December 31, 2019 we had remaining authorization to repurchase $66.3 million in shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program. During 2019 , we repurchased 72,368 shares of our common stock for $5.2 million from employees in connection with a net share settlement feature of employee equity-based awards. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2019 , we had the following contractual obligations (in millions; note references are to the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein): Payments due by period 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter Total Floor plan notes payable (Notes10&11) $ 850.8 $ $ $ $ $ $ 850.8 Operating lease liabilities (a) 21.2 19.0 14.3 6.6 3.1 12.3 76.5 Operating lease liabilities expense (a) 3.0 2.1 1.4 1.0 0.7 5.1 13.3 Long-term debt (Note 13) (a) 35.7 35.0 33.2 53.2 648.6 165.7 971.4 Interest on long-term debt (a)(b) 49.6 47.6 46.7 44.8 41.4 6.9 237.0 Total contractual obligations $ 960.3 $ 103.7 $ 95.6 $ 105.6 $ 693.8 $ 190.0 $ 2,149.0 ________________________________________ (a) For additional information related to the Company's operating and finance lease liabilities presented within the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 18 "Leases" of the Notes thereto. (b) Includes variable rate interest payments calculated using an estimated LIBOR rate of 1.78%, and assumes that borrowings will not be refinanced prior to or upon maturity. Cash Flows Classification of Cash Flows Associated with Floor Plan Notes Payable Borrowings and repayments of floor plan notes payable to a lender unaffiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchase a particular new vehicle ("Non-Trade"), and all floor plan notes payable relating to used vehicles (together referred to as "Floor Plan Notes Payable Non-Trade"), are classified as financing activities on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, with borrowings reflected separately from repayments. The net change in floor plan notes payable to a lender affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchase a particular new vehicle (collectively referred to as "Floor Plan Notes Payable Trade") is classified as an operating activity on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Borrowings of floor plan notes payable associated with inventory acquired in connection with all acquisitions and repayments made in connection with all divestitures are classified as a financing activity in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in operating activities differ from cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in financing activities only to the extent that the former are payable to a lender affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchased the related inventory, while the latter are payable to a lender not affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchased the related inventory. The majority of our floor plan notes are payable to parties unaffiliated with the entities from which we purchase our new vehicle inventory, with the exception of floor plan notes payable relating to the financing of new Ford and Lincoln vehicles. Floor plan borrowings are required by all vehicle manufacturers for the purchase of new vehicles, and all floor plan lenders require amounts borrowed for the purchase of a vehicle to be repaid within a short time period after the related vehicle is sold. As a result, we believe that it is important to understand the relationship between the cash flows of all of our floor plan notes payable and new vehicle inventory in order to understand our working capital and operating cash flow and to be able to compare our operating cash flow to that of our competitors (i.e., if our competitors have a different mix of trade and non-trade floor plan financing as compared to us). In addition, we include all floor plan borrowings and repayments in our internal operating cash flow forecasts. As a result, we use the non-GAAP measure "cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted" (defined below) to compare our results to forecasts. We believe that splitting the cash flows of floor plan notes payable between operating activities and financing activities, while all new vehicle inventory activity is included in operating activities, results in significantly different operating cash flow than if all the cash flows of floor plan notes payable were classified together in operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted, includes borrowings and repayments of floor plan notes payable to lenders not affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchase the related new vehicles and all floor plan notes payable relating to used vehicles. Cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted, has material limitations, and therefore, may not be 57 Table of Contents comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results in accordance with GAAP. In order to compensate for these potential limitations we also review the related GAAP measures. We have provided below a reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities, as if all changes in floor plan notes payable, except for (i) borrowings associated with acquisitions and repayments associated with divestitures and (ii) borrowings and repayments associated with the purchase of used vehicle inventory, were classified as an operating activity. For the Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Reconciliation of Cash provided by operating activities to Cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted Cash provided by operating activities, as reported $ 349.8 $ 10.1 $ 266.3 New vehicle floor plan borrowings (repayments) non-trade, net (194.7 ) 171.5 (70.7 ) Cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted $ 155.1 $ 181.6 $ 195.6 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $349.8 million , $10.1 million , and $266.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted, totaled $155.1 million , $181.6 million , and $195.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively.
