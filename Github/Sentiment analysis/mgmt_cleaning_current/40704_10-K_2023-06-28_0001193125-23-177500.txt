ITEM 7 - Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a global packaged foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new products, and effective merchandising. We believe our brand-building approach is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe. Our fundamental financial goal is to generate competitively differentiated returns for our shareholders over the long term. We believe achieving that goal requires us to generate a consistent balance of net sales growth, margin expansion, cash conversion, and cash return to shareholders over time. Our long-term growth objectives are to deliver the following performance on average over time: 2 to 3 percent annual growth in organic net sales; mid-single-digit annual growth in adjusted operating profit; mid- to high-single-digit annual growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS); free cash flow conversion of at least 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and cash return to shareholders of 80 to 90 percent of free cash flow, including an attractive dividend yield. We are executing our Accelerate strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth and top-tier shareholder returns over the long term. The strategy focuses on four pillars to create competitive advantages and win: boldly building brands, relentlessly innovating, unleashing our scale, and being a force for good. We are prioritizing our core markets, global platforms, and local gem brands that have the best prospects for profitable growth, and we are committed to reshaping our portfolio with strategic acquisitions and divestitures to further enhance our growth profile. In fiscal 2023, we continued to successfully adapt to the dynamic operating environment and deliver strong performance. This included growth in organic net sales, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted diluted EPS that was ahead of our initial targets. We achieved each of the three priorities we established at the beginning of the year: We continued to compete effectively, including holding or growing market share in more than 50 percent of our global priority businesses for the fifth consecutive year, when adjusting for an unusual competitive dynamic in cereal in fiscal 2022 and assessing that platform on a 2-year basis. We generated organic net sales growth across each of our four operating segments, fueled by compelling brand building and innovation across our leading brands, and supported with strong levels of net price realization in response to 13 percent input cost inflation. We continued to invest for the future, including a 17 percent increase in media and advertising expense, a double-digit increase in investment in our digital and technology capability, and a strong increase in capital investment related to new growth capacity. We continued to reshape our portfolio, including closing on one acquisition and two divestitures that further improved our portfolio ability to generate profitable growth over the long term. Our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023 rose 6 percent to $20,094 million. On an organic basis, net sales increased 10 percent compared to year-ago levels. Operating profit of $3,434 million was down 1 percent. Adjusted operating profit of $3,457 million increased 8 percent on a constant-currency basis. Diluted EPS of $4.31 was down 2 percent compared to fiscal 2022 results. Adjusted diluted EPS of $4.30 increased 10 percent on a constant-currency basis (See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)). Net cash provided by operations totaled $2,779 million in fiscal 2023, representing a conversion rate of 106 percent of net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling $690 million, and our resulting free cash flow was $2,089 million at a conversion rate of 80 percent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. We returned cash to shareholders through dividends totaling $1,288 million and net share repurchases totaling $1,171 million. (See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). A detailed review of our fiscal 2023 performance compared to fiscal 2022 appears below in the section titled Fiscal 2023 Consolidated Results of Operations. A detailed review of our fiscal 2022 performance compared to our fiscal 2021 performance is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2022 under the caption Management Discussion and 16 Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Fiscal 2022 Results of Consolidated Operations, which is incorporated herein by reference. In fiscal 202 4, we expect to build on our positive momentum and continue to advance our Accelerate strategy. Our key priorities are to continue to compete effectively, to improve our supply chain efficiency, and to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation. We expect the largest factors impacting our performance in fiscal 2024 will be the economic health of consumers, the moderating rate of input cost inflation, and the increasing stability of the supply chain environment. We expect to drive organic net sales growth in fiscal 2024 through strong marketing, innovation, in-store support, and net price realization generated through our Strategic Revenue Management (SRM) capability, most of which will be carried over from SRM actions taken in fiscal 2023. For the full year, input cost inflation is expected to be approximately 5 percent of total cost of goods sold, driven primarily by labor inflation that continues to impact sourcing, manufacturing, and logistics costs. We expect to generate higher levels of Holistic Margin Management (HMM) cost savings compared to fiscal 2023. Based on these assumptions, our key full-year fiscal 2024 targets are summarized below: Organic net sales are expected to increase 3 to 4 percent. Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 4 to 6 percent in constant-currency from the base of $3,457 million reported in fiscal 2023. Adjusted diluted EPS are expected to range between 4 to 6 percent in constant-currency from the base of $4.30 earned in fiscal 2023. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be at least 95 percent of adjusted after-tax earnings. See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP. Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report. FISCAL 2023 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In fiscal 2023, net sales increased 6 percent compared to fiscal 2022 and organic net sales increased 10 percent compared to last year. Operating profit decreased 1 percent to $3,434 million primarily driven by higher input costs, a decrease in contributions from volume growth, an unfavorable change to the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodities positions and grain inventories, and an increase in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, including increased media and advertising expenses, partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix. Operating profit margin of 17.1 percent decreased 120 basis points. Adjusted operating profit of $3, 457 million increased 8 percent on a constant-currency basis, primarily driven by favorable net price realization and mix, partially offset by higher input costs, a decrease in contributions from volume growth and an increase in SG&A expenses, including increased media and advertising expenses. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 17.2 percent. Diluted earnings per share of $4.31 decreased 2 percent compared to fiscal 2022. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.30 increased 10 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). A summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2023 follows: Fiscal 2023 In millions, except per share Fiscal 2023 vs. Fiscal 2022 Percent of Net Sales Constant- Currency Growth (a) Net sales $ 20,094.2 6 % Operating profit 3,433.8 (1) % 17.1 % Net earnings attributable to General Mills 2,593.9 (4) % Diluted earnings per share $ 4.31 (2) % Organic net sales growth rate (a) 10 % Adjusted operating profit (a) 3,457.3 8 % 17.2 % 8 % Adjusted diluted earnings per share (a) $ 4.30 9 % 10 % (a) See the "Non-GAAP Measures" section below for our use of measures not defined by GAAP. 17 Consolidated net sales were as follows: Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2023 vs. Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2022 Net sales (in millions) $ 20,094.2 6 % $ 18,992.8 Contributions from volume growth (a) (8) pts Net price realization and mix 15 pts Foreign currency exchange (1) pt Note: Table may not foot due to rounding (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Net sales in fiscal 2023 increased 6 percent compared to fiscal 2022, driven by favorable net price realization and mix, partially offset by a decrease in contributions from volume growth and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Components of organic net sales growth are shown in the following table: Fiscal 2023 vs. Fiscal 2022 Contributions from organic volume growth (a) (4) pts Organic net price realization and mix 14 pts Organic net sales growth 10 pts Foreign currency exchange (1) pt Acquisitions and divestitures (4) pts Net sales growth 6 pts Note: Table may not foot due to rounding (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Organic net sales in fiscal 2023 increased 10 percent compared to fiscal 2022, driven by favorable organic net price realization and mix, partially offset by a decrease in contributions from organic volume growth. Cost of sales increased $958 million in fiscal 2023 to $13,548 million. The increase was primarily driven by a $1,454 million increase attributable to product rate and mix, partially offset by a $950 million decrease due to lower volume. We recorded a $292 million net increase in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2023, compared to a net decrease of $133 million in fiscal 2022 (please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information). In fiscal 2023, we recorded a $25 million charge related to a voluntary recall on certain international H agen-Dazs ice cream products. We also recorded $5 million of restructuring charges and $2 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2023 compared to $3 million of restructuring charges in cost of sales in fiscal 2022 (please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information). Gross margin increased 2 percent in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 110 basis points to 32.6 percent compared to fiscal 2022. SG&A expenses increased $353 million to $3,500 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily driven by increased media and advertising expenses, unfavorable valuation adjustments and the loss on sale of certain corporate investments, an increase in certain compensation and benefits expenses, and an increase in charitable contributions in fiscal 2023. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2023 increased 80 basis points compared to fiscal 2022. Divestitures gain, net totaled $445 million in fiscal 2023 primarily related to the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad side dishes business. In fiscal 2022, we recorded a $194 million divestitures gain related to the sale of our interest in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait marques SNC and Libert Marques S rl and our European dough businesses (please refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report). Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs (recoveries) totaled $56 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $26 million of net recoveries in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023, we approved restructuring actions to enhance the efficiency of our global supply chain structure and to optimize our H agen-Dazs shops network, and as a result, we recorded $41 million of charges in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2022, we approved restructuring actions in the International segment to drive efficiencies in manufacturing and logistics operations and recorded $12 million of charges. Please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information. 18 Benefit plan non-service income totaled $89 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $113 million in fiscal 2022, primarily reflecting an increase in interest costs, partially offset by lower amortization of losses and higher expected return on plan assets (please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information). Interest, net for fiscal 2023 totaled $382 million, $2 million higher than fiscal 2022. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 19.5 percent compared to 18.3 percent in fiscal 2022. The 1.2 percentage point increase was primarily driven by a change in the valuation allowance on our capital loss carryforward s in fiscal 2022, partially offset by certain favorable discrete tax items in fiscal 2023 . Our adjusted effective tax rate was 20.4 percent in fiscal 2023 compared to 20.9 percent in fiscal 2022 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The 0.5 percentage point decrease was primarily due to certain favorable discrete tax items in fiscal 2023. After-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased to $81 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $112 million in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by higher input costs at CPW and HDJ and lower net sales at HDJ, partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix at CPW. On a constant-currency basis, after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased 18 percent (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The components of our joint ventures net sales growth are shown in the following table: Fiscal 2023 vs. Fiscal 2022 CPW HDJ Total Contributions from volume growth (a) (10) pts (5) pts Net price realization and mix 14 pts Flat Net sales growth in constant currency 4 pts (5) pts 2 pts Foreign currency exchange (8) pts (15) pts (10) pts Net sales growth (5) pts (21) pts (8) pts Note: Table may not foot due to rounding (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Net earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests decreased to $16 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $28 million in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by the sale of our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, and Libert Marques S rl in fiscal 2022. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 11 million in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022 primarily due to share repurchases, partially offset by option exercises. RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Our businesses are organized into four operating segments: North America Retail, International, Pet, and North America Foodservice . In fiscal 2022, we completed a new organization structure to streamline our global operations. We restated our net sales by segment and segment operating profit to reflect our new operating segments. These segment changes had no effect on previously reported consolidated net sales, operating profit, net earnings attributable to General Mills, or earnings per share. 19 The following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each segment for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022: Fiscal Year 2023 2022 In Millions Dollars Percent of Total Dollars Percent of Total Net Sales North America Retail $ 12,659.9 63 % $ 11,572.0 61 % International 2,769.5 14 3,315.7 17 Pet 2,473.3 12 2,259.4 12 North America Foodservice 2,191.5 11 1,845.7 10 Total $ 20,094.2 100 % $ 18,992.8 100 % Segment Operating Profit North America Retail $ 3,181.3 78 % $ 2,699.7 74 % International 161.8 4 232.0 6 Pet 445.5 11 470.6 13 North America Foodservice 290.0 7 255.5 7 Total $ 4,078.6 100 % $ 3,657.8 100 % Segment operating profit as reviewed by our executive management excludes unallocated corporate items, net gain or loss on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs that are centrally managed.

Segment operating profit increased 14 percent to $290 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $256 million in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by favorable net price realization and mix, partially offset by higher input costs and an increase in SG&A expenses. Segment operating profit increased 14 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure not defined by GAAP). UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, certain charitable contributions, restructuring initiative project-related costs, gains and losses on corporate investments, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. These include gains and losses arising from the revaluation of certain grain inventories and gains and losses from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments. These items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by executive management. Under our supply chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse, and distribution activities are substantially integrated across our operations in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, fixed assets and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither maintained nor available by operating segment. Unallocated corporate expense totaled $1,033 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $403 million last year. We recorded a $292 million net increase in expense related to the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2023, compared to a $133 million net decrease in expense last year. We recorded $84 million of net losses related to valuation adjustments and the sale of corporate investments in fiscal 2023, compared to $15 million of net losses in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023, we recorded a $22 million net charge related to a voluntary recall on certain international H agen-Dazs ice cream products. In addition, we recorded $6 million of integration costs primarily related to our acquisition of TNT Crust in fiscal 2023, compared to $22 million of integration costs related to our acquisition of Tyson Foods pet treats business in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2022, we recorded $73 million of transaction costs primarily related to the sale of our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, Libert Marques S rl and the sale of our European dough businesses. In addition, we recorded a $22 million recovery related to a Brazil indirect tax item and a $13 million insurance recovery in fiscal 2022. In addition, certain compensation and benefits expenses and charitable contributions increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. IMPACT OF INFLATION We experienced broad based global input cost inflation of 13 percent in fiscal 2023 and 8 percent in fiscal 2022. We expect approximately 5 percent input cost inflation in fiscal 2024. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through HMM, SRM, planning, and operating practices. Our market risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent two-year period, our operations have generated $6.1 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We also use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions, and debt service. We typically use a 24 combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt, and occasionally issue shares of common stock, to finance significant acquisitions. As of May 28, 2023, we had $381 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions. In anticipation of repatriating funds from foreign jurisdictions, we record local country withholding taxes on our international earnings, as applicable. We may repatriate our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. income tax liability. Earnings prior to fiscal 2018 from our foreign subsidiaries remain permanently reinvested in those jurisdictions.

The $538 million decrease was primarily driven by a $326 million change in current assets and liabilities and a $250 million change in net divestitures gain. The $326 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a $233 million change in inventories and a $257 million change in accounts payable, partially offset by a $125 million change in the timing of accounts receivable. We strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2023, core working capital net liability decreased 20 percent, compared to a net sales increase of 6 percent. The core working capital net liability decreased $84 million from a net liability of $423 million in fiscal 2022 to a net liability of $339 million in fiscal 2023. The $84 million net liability decrease was primarily due to an increase in inventories, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable in fiscal 2023. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Fiscal Year In Millions 2023 2022 Purchases of land, buildings, and equipment $ (689.5) $ (568.7) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (251.5) (1,201.3) Investments in affiliates, net (32.2) 15.4 Proceeds from disposal of land, buildings, and equipment 1.3 3.3 Proceeds from divestitures, net of cash divested 633.1 74.1 Other, net (7.6) (13.5) Net cash used by investing activities $ (346.4) $ (1,690.7) In fiscal 2023, we used $346 million of cash through investing activities compared to $1,691 million in fiscal 2022. We invested $690 million in land, buildings, and equipment in fiscal 2023, an increase of $121 million from fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2023, we acquired TNT Crust for $252 million cash, net of cash acquired. During fiscal 2023, we completed the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad side dishes businesses for cash proceeds of $607 million. During fiscal 2022, we acquired Tyson Foods pet treats business for an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion. During fiscal 2022, we sold our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, and Libert Marques S rl for cash proceeds of $32 million, net of cash 25 divested, as part of the sale. We also completed the sale of our European dough businesses in fiscal 2022 for cash proceeds of $42 million. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately 4 percent of reported net sales in fiscal 2024. These expenditures will fund initiatives that are expected to fuel growth, support innovative products, and continue HMM initiatives throughout the supply chain. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Fiscal Year In Millions 2023 2022 Change in notes payable $ (769.3) $ 551.4 Issuance of long-term debt 2,324.4 2,203.7 Payment of long-term debt (1,421.7) (3,140.9) Proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options 232.3 161.7 Purchases of common stock for treasury (1,403.6) (876.8) Dividends paid (1,287.9) (1,244.5) Distributions to redeemable and noncontrolling interest holders (15.7) (129.8) Other, net (62.6) (28.0) Net cash used by financing activities $ (2,404.1) $ (2,503.2) Financing activities used $2.4 billion of cash in fiscal 2023 compared to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2022. We had $133 million of net debt issuances in fiscal 2023 compared to $386 million of net debt repayments in fiscal 2022. For more information on our debt issuances and payments, please refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. During fiscal 2023, we received $232 million of net proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options compared to $162 million in fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2023, we repurchased 18 million shares of our common stock for $1,404 million. During fiscal 2022, we repurchased 14 million shares of our common stock for $877 million. Dividends paid in fiscal 2023 totaled $1,288 million, or $2.16 per share. Dividends paid in fiscal 2022 totaled $1,244 million, or $2.04 per share. Selected Cash Flows from Joint Ventures Selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table: Fiscal Year Inflow (Outflow), in Millions 2023 2022 Investments in affiliates, net $ (32.2) $ 15.4 Dividends received 69.9 107.5 The following table details the fee-paid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of May 28, 2023: In Billions Facility Amount Borrowed Amount Committed credit facility expiring April 2026 $ 2.7 $ - Uncommitted credit facilities 0.6 - Total committed and uncommitted credit facilities $ 3.3 $ - To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines and have commercial paper programs available to us in the United States and Europe. We have material contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business and we believe that cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. 26 Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 28, 2023, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. We have $1,709 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including $500 million of 3.65 percent fixed-rate notes due February 15, 2024, $400 million of floating-rate notes due October 17, 2023, 500 million of floating-rate notes due July 27, 2023, and 250 million of floating-rate notes due November 10, 2023. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. As of May 28, 2023, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 80 percent in fixed-rate and 20 percent in floating-rate instruments, compared to 77 percent in fixed-rate and 23 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 29, 2022. The third-party holder of the General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder capital account balance established in the most recent mark -to-market valuation (currently $252 million). The floating preferred return rate on GMC Class A Interests is the sum of three -month Term SOFR plus 186 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction. We have an option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holder capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that period. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our critical accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans . Revenue Recognition Our revenues are reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion, consumer coupon redemption, and other reductions to the transaction price, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between the estimated and actual reduction to the transaction price are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade and coupon promotion liabilities were $394 million as of May 28, 2023, and $420 million as of May 29, 2022. Because these amounts are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets We estimate the useful lives of long -lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate. Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. We use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. 27 As of May 28, 2023, we had $21 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value, and that those intangibles will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense. We performed our fiscal 2023 assessment of our intangible assets as of the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2023, and we determined there was no impairment of our intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying value, except for Uncle Toby band intangible asset. In addition, while having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2023 assessment date, the Progresso and EPIC brand intangible assets had risk of decreasing coverage. We will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment. Stock-based Compensation The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. For more information on these assumptions, please see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: Fiscal Year 2023 2022 2021 Estimated fair values of stock options granted $ 14.16 $ 8.77 $ 8.03 Assumptions: Risk-free interest rate 3.3 % 1.5 % 0.7 % Expected term 8.5 years 8.5 years 8.5 years Expected volatility 20.9 % 20.2 % 19.5 % Dividend yield 3.1 % 3.4 % 3.3 % The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would decrease the grant date fair value by less than 1 percent . If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2023 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2023 option awards by 5 percent. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. Historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year- over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense. Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. The actual impact on future years cash flows will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes. Realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. Income Taxes We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change. For more information on income taxes, please see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former and inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. 28 We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants active working lives. Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates. Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were a 5.7 percent loss in the 1-year period ended May 28, 2023 and returns of 3.4 percent, 5.9 percent, 5.5 percent, and 7.7 percent for the 5, 10, 15, and 20-year periods ended May 28, 2023. On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 6.70 percent for fiscal 2023, 5.85 percent for fiscal 2022, and 5.72 percent for fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2024, we increased our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States to 7.20 percent due to higher prospective long-term asset returns primarily on fixed income investments. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $62 million for fiscal 2024. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market- related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income. Discount Rates We estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our international defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions. Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows: Defined Benefit Pension Plans Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Postemployment Benefit Plans Effective rate for fiscal 2024 service costs 5.27 % 5.15 % 5.00 % Effective rate for fiscal 2024 interest costs 5.06 % 4.96 % 4.61 % Obligations as of May 31, 2023 5.18 % 5.19 % 4.55 % Effective rate for fiscal 2023 service costs 4.57 % 4.41 % 3.69 % Effective rate for fiscal 2023 interest costs 4.03 % 3.80 % 3.35 % Obligations as of May 31, 2022 4.39 % 4.36 % 3.62 % Effective rate for fiscal 2022 service costs 3.53 % 3.34 % 2.46 % Effective rate for fiscal 2022 interest costs 2.42 % 2.08 % 1.48 % Lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2024 by approximately $30 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as all or almost all inactive participants. 29 Health Care Cost Trend Rates We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 6.6 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.6 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2023. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2032 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight -line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as all or almost all inactive participants. Financial Statement Impact In fiscal 2023, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income of $6 million compared to $26 million of income in fiscal 2022 and $4 million of expense in fiscal 2021. As of May 28, 2023, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $2 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative unrecognized actuarial net gains of $189 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower historical interest rates. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued optional accounting guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The new standard provides expedients and exceptions to existing accounting requirements for contract modifications and hedge accounting related to transitioning from discontinued reference rates, such as LIBOR, to alternative reference rates, if certain criteria are met. The new accounting requirements can be applied through December 31, 2024. We have reviewed and modified certain contracts, where necessary, to apply a new reference rate, primarily the SOFR. The guidance has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. We will continue to review our contracts and arrangements that will be affected by a discontinued reference rate during the transition period. In September 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-04 requiring enhanced disclosures related to supplier financing programs. The ASU requires disclosure of the key terms of the program and a rollforward of the related obligation during the annual period, including the amount of obligations confirmed and obligations subsequently paid. The new disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with the exception of the rollforward requirement, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2024 for the primary requirement and the first quarter of fiscal 2025 for the rollforward requirement. Early adoption is permitted. We have historically presented the key terms of these programs and the associated obligation outstanding. We do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures. NON-GAAP MEASURES We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. We believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why we believe the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors, and any additional material purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure. 30 Significant Items Impacting Comparability Several measures below are presented on an adjusted basis. The adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that, in management judgment, significantly affect the year-to-year assessment of operating results. The following are descriptions of significant items impacting comparability of our results. Divestitures gain, net Net divestitures gain primarily related to the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad side dishes business in fiscal 2023. Divestitures gain related to the sale of our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, and Libert Marques S rl and the sale of our European dough businesses in fiscal 2022. Please see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Mark-to-market effects Net mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions recognized in unallocated corporate items. Please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Investment activity, net Valuation adjustments and the loss on sale of certain corporate investments in fiscal 2023. Valuation adjustments and the gain on sale of certain corporate investments in fiscal 2022. Restructuring charges (recoveries) and project-related costs Restructuring charges and project-related costs for global supply chain actions, network optimization actions, and previously announced restructuring actions in fiscal 2023. Restructuring charges for International restructuring actions and net restructuring recoveries for previously announced restructuring actions in fiscal 2022. Please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Product recall, net Voluntary recall costs recorded in fiscal 2023 related to certain international H agen-Dazs ice cream products, net of insurance recovery.

Integration costs resulting from the acquisition of Tyson Foods pet treats business in fiscal 2022. Please see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Transaction costs Transaction costs primarily related to the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad side dish business in fiscal 2023. Fiscal 2022 transaction costs related primarily to the sale of our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, and Libert Marques S rl, the sale of our European dough businesses, the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad side dishes business, and the acquisition of TNT Crust. Please see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Non-income tax recovery Recovery related to a Brazil indirect tax item recorded in fiscal 2022. Tax item Discrete tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2022 related to a release of a valuation allowance associated with our capital loss carryforwards expected to be used against future divestiture gains. CPW restructuring charges CPW restructuring charges related to previously announced restructuring actions. Organic Net Sales Growth Rates We provide organic net sales growth rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales. This measure is used in reporting to our Board of Directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that organic net sales growth rates provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a 53 rd week, when applicable, have on year-to-year comparability. A reconciliation of these measures to reported net sales growth rates, the relevant GAAP measures, are included in our Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Segment Operations discussions in the MD&A above. 31 Adjusted Operating Profit and Related Constant-currency Growth Rate This measure is used in reporting to our Board of Directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the operating profit measure we use to evaluate operating profit performance on a comparable year-to-year basis. Additionally, the measure is evaluated on a constant-currency basis by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given the volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Our adjusted operating profit growth on a constant-currency basis is calculated as follows: Fiscal Year 2023 2022 Change Operating profit as reported $ 3,433.8 $ 3,475.8 (1) % Divestitures gain, net (444.6) (194.1) Mark-to-market effects 291.9 (133.1) Investment activity, net 84.0 14.7 Restructuring charges (recoveries) 61.0 (23.2) Product recall, net 22.5 - Acquisition integration costs 5.9 22.4 Project related costs 2.4 - Transaction costs 0.4 72.8 Non-income tax recovery - (22.0) Adjusted operating profit $ 3,457.3 $ 3,213.3 8 % Foreign currency exchange impact Flat Adjusted operating profit growth, on a constant-currency basis 8 % Note: Table may not foot due to rounding. For more information on the reconciling items, please refer to the Significant Items Impacting Comparability section above. 32 Adjusted Diluted EPS and Related Constant-currency Growth Rate This measure is used in reporting to our Board of Directors and executive management. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-to-year basis. The reconciliation of our GAAP measure, diluted EPS, to adjusted diluted EPS and the related constant-currency growth rate follows: Fiscal Year Per Share Data 2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022 Change Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 4.31 $ 4.42 (2) % Divestitures gain, net (0.62) (0.31) Mark-to-market effects 0.37 (0.17) Investment activity, net 0.11 0.01 Restructuring charges (recoveries) 0.08 (0.03) Product recall, net 0.03 - Acquisition integration costs 0.01 0.03 Transaction costs - 0.09 Non-income tax recovery - (0.02) Tax item - (0.08) Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 4.30 $ 3.94 9 % Foreign currency exchange impact (1) pt Adjusted diluted earnings per share growth, on a constant-currency basis 10 % Note: Table may not foot due to rounding. For more information on the reconciling items, please refer to the Significant Items Impacting Comparability section above. See our reconciliation below of the effective income tax rate as reported to the adjusted effective income tax rate for the tax impact of each item affecting comparability. 33 Free Cash Flow Conversion Rate We believe this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing our efficiency in converting earnings to cash and returning cash to shareholders. The calculation of free cash flow conversion rate and net cash provided by operating activities conversion rate, its equivalent GAAP measure, follows: In Millions Fiscal 2023 Net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests, as reported $ 2,609.6 Divestitures gain, net of tax (371.4) Mark-to-market effects, net of tax 224.8 Investment activity, net, net of tax 66.0 Restructuring charges, net of tax 48.4 Product recall, net, net of tax 17.3 Acquisition integration costs, net of tax 4.6 Project related costs, net of tax 1.6 CPW restructuring charges, net of tax 1.0 Transaction costs, net of tax 0.2 Adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests $ 2,602.2 Net cash provided by operating activities 2,778.6 Purchases of land, buildings, and equipment (689.5) Free cash flow $ 2,089.1 Net cash provided by operating activities conversion rate 106% Free cash flow conversion rate 80% Note: Table may not foot due rounding.

After-tax earnings from joint ventures growth rate on a constant-currency basis are calculated as follows: Fiscal 2023 Percentage change in after-tax earnings from joint ventures as reported (27) % Impact of foreign currency exchange (10) pts Percentage change in after-tax earnings from joint ventures on a constant-currency basis (18) % Note: Table may not foot due to rounding. Net Sales Growth Rate for Canada Operating Unit on a Constant-currency Basis We believe this measure of our Canada operating unit net sales provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to the underlying performance for the Canada operating unit within our North America Retail segment by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. Net sales growth rate for our Canada operating unit on a constant-currency basis is calculated as follows: Fiscal 2023 Percentage change in net sales as reported 2 % Impact of foreign currency exchange (6) pts Percentage change in net sales on a constant-currency basis 8 % Note: Table may not foot due to rounding. Constant-currency Segment Operating Profit Growth Rates We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance of our segments by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. Our segments operating profit growth rates on a constant-currency basis are calculated as follows: Fiscal 2023 Percentage Change in Operating Profit as Reported Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Percentage Change in Operating Profit on Constant- Currency Basis North America Retail 18 % Flat 18 % International (30) % (5) pts (25) % Pet (5) % Flat (5) % North America Foodservice 14 % Flat 14 % Note: Table may not foot due to rounding. Forward-Looking Financial Measures Our fiscal 202 4 outlook for organic net sales growth, constant-currency adjusted operating profit, adjusted diluted EPS, and free cash flow conversion are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude, or have otherwise been adjusted for, items impacting comparability, including the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, restructuring charges and project-related costs, acquisition transaction and integration costs, acquisitions, divestitures, and mark-to-market effects. We are not able to reconcile these forward- looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign 37 currency exchange rates and commodity prices or the timing or impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and restructuring actions throughout fiscal 2024. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2024 GAAP financial results. For fiscal 2024, we currently expect: foreign currency exchange rates (based on a blend of forward and forecasted rates and hedge positions) and acquisitions and divestitures completed prior to fiscal 2024 to reduce net sales growth by approximately one half of one percent; and restructuring charges to total approximately $15 million to $20 million.
