Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussions should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this report, including the Financial Statements and related notes contained in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements. Overview-Introduction We are a leading specialty contractor serving the electrical infrastructure market. We manage and report our operations through two industry segments: T&D and C&I. We have operated in the T&D industry since 1891. We are one of the largest contractors servicing the T&D sector of the electric utility industry in the United States and are expanding our T&D services into Canada. Our customers include many of the leading companies in the industry. We have provided C&I electrical contracting services to facility owners and general contractors since 1912. In 2016, our acquisition of Western Pacific Enterprises Ltd. further expanded our C&I services and enhanced our T&D services in western Canada. We strive to maintain our status as a preferred provider to our T&D and C&I customers. We believe that we have a number of competitive advantages in both of our segments, including our skilled workforce, extensive centralized fleet, proven safety performance and reputation for timely completion of quality work that allows us to compete favorably in our markets. In addition, we believe that we are better capitalized than some of our competitors, which provides us with valuable flexibility to take on additional and complex projects. We had revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016, of $1.142 billion compared to $1.062 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our net income was $21.4 million compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in revenue was primarily due to organic and acquisitive growth, partially offset by a decline in revenue in some geographic areas. Our expansion into new markets increased our operating costs, which was the primary cause of our decrease in net income. Overview-Segments Transmission and Distribution segment. Our T&D segment provides comprehensive solutions to customers in the electric utility industry and the renewable energy industry. Our T&D segment generally serves the electric utility industry as a prime contractor to customers such as investor-owned utilities, cooperatives, private developers, government-funded utilities, independent power producers, independent transmission companies, industrial facility owners and other contractors. Our T&D segment provides a broad range of services on electric transmission and distribution networks and substation facilities which include design, engineering, procurement, construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services with a particular focus on construction, maintenance and repair. The demand for transmission construction and maintenance services has increased over the past several years due to the modernization of the existing electric utility infrastructure and the need to integrate renewable generation into the electric power grid. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our T&D revenues were $819.0 million or 71.7% of our revenue, compared to $794.9 million or 74.9% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $699.6 million or 74.1% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues from transmission projects represented 75.8%, 73.9%, and 77.8% of T&D segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our T&D segment also provides storm restoration services in response to hurricanes, ice storms or other storm related events, which typically account for less than 5% of our annual revenues. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized revenues from storm restoration services of approximately $7.1 million, $7.7 million and $13.3 million, respectively, which represented approximately 0.6%, 0.7% and 1.4% of our annual revenues, respectively. 30 TABLE OF CONTENTS Measured by revenues in our T&D segment, we provided 56.9%, 48.4% and 53.1% of our T&D services under fixed-price contracts during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We also provide many services to our customers under multi-year maintenance service agreements and other variable service agreements. Commercial and Industrial segment. Our C&I segment provides services such as the design, installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring, installation of traffic networks and the installation of bridge, roadway and tunnel lighting. In our C&I segment, we generally provide our electric construction and maintenance services as a subcontractor to general contractors in the C&I industry as well as to facility owners. Our C&I operations are primarily in the western and northeastern United States and in western Canada where we have sufficient scale to deploy the level of resources necessary to achieve significant market share. We concentrate our efforts on projects where our technical and project management expertise are critical to successful and timely execution. The majority of C&I contracts cover electrical contracting services for airports, hospitals, data centers, hotels, stadiums, convention centers, manufacturing plants, processing facilities, waste-water treatment facilities, mining facilities and transportation control and management systems. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our C&I revenues were $323.5 million or 28.3% of our revenue, compared to $266.8 million or 25.1% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $244.4 million or 25.9% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Measured by revenues in our C&I segment, we provided 73.4%, 71.6% and 41.7% of our services under fixed-price contracts for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Overview-Revenue and Gross Margins Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue on a percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which is commonly used in the construction industry. The percentage-of-completion accounting method results in recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The profits or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Contract losses are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability. Changes in job performance, labor costs, equipment costs, job conditions, weather, estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. We record adjustments to estimated costs of contracts when we believe the change in estimate is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. These adjustments could result in either increases or decreases in profit margins. The gross margins we record in the current period may not be indicative of margins in future periods. Gross Margins. Our gross margin can vary between periods as a result of many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include: the mix of revenue derived from the industries we serve, the size and duration of our projects, the mix of business conducted in different parts of the United States and Canada, the mix in service and maintenance work compared to new construction work, the amount of work that we subcontract, the amount of material we supply, changes in labor, equipment or insurance costs, seasonal weather patterns, changes in fleet utilization, pricing pressures due to competition, efficiency of work performance, fluctuations in commodity prices of materials, delays in the timing of projects and other factors. Overview-Economic, Industry and Market Factors We operate in competitive markets, which can result in pricing pressures for the services we provide. Work is often awarded through a bidding and selection process, where price is always a principal factor. We generally focus on managing our profitability by: selecting projects that we believe will provide attractive margins; actively monitoring the costs of completing our projects; holding customers accountable for costs related to changes to contract specifications; and rewarding our employees for controlling costs. The demand for construction and maintenance services from our customers has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the markets we serve as well as the economy in general. The financial condition of our customers and their access to capital, variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular period, and regional and national economic conditions in the 31 TABLE OF CONTENTS United States and Canada may materially affect results. Project schedules, particularly in connection with larger, multi-year projects, can also create fluctuations in our revenues. Other market and industry factors, such as changes to our customers capital spending plans or delays in regulatory approvals can affect project schedules. Changes in technology, tax and other incentives and new or changing regulatory requirements affecting the industries we serve can impact demand for our services. While we actively monitor economic, industry and market factors affecting our business, we cannot predict the impact such factors may have on our future results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. As a result of economic, industry and market factors, our operating results in any particular period or year may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other period or for any other year. Overview-Seasonality Although our revenues are primarily driven by spending patterns in our customers industries, our revenues, particularly those derived from our T&D segment, and results of operations can be subject to seasonal variations. These variations are influenced by weather, daylight hours, availability of system outages from utilities, and holidays. During the winter months, demand for our T&D work may be high, but our work can be delayed due to inclement weather. During the summer months, the demand for our T&D work may be affected by fewer available system outages during which we can perform electrical line service work due to peak electrical demands caused by warmer weather conditions. During the spring and fall months, the demand for our T&D work may increase due to improved weather conditions and system availability; however, extended periods of rain and other severe weather can affect the deployment of our crews and efficiency of operations. We also provide storm restoration services to our T&D customers. These services tend to have a higher profit margin. However, storm restoration service work that is performed under an MSA typically has similar rates to other work under the agreement. In addition, deploying employees on storm restoration work may, at times, delay work on other transmission and distribution work. Storm restoration service work is unpredictable and can affect results of operations. Outlook We continue to expect long-term growth in the transmission market, although the timing of large bids and subsequent construction is likely to be highly variable from year to year. We believe several multi-year transmission projects will be available for bid in the 2017 to 2018 timeframe. We also expect bidding activity in small and medium-sized transmission and distribution projects to continue in 2017. While it is unclear what impact the new administration may have on our business, we are optimistic about overall economic growth and infrastructure spending and believe that improving industry activity will continue in both of our market segments and the drivers for utility investment will remain intact. We believe that regulatory reform, state renewable portfolio standards, the aging of the electric grid, and the general improvement of the economy will positively impact the level of spending by our customers. Although competition remains strong, we see these trends as positive factors for us in the future. Our business is directly impacted by the level of spending on T&D infrastructure and the level of C&I electrical construction activity across the United States and Canada. The electric grid is aging and requires significant upgrades and maintenance to meet current and future demands for electricity. In addition, regulatory pressures and low energy prices may accelerate the shut-down of coal-fired generating plants, which could result in the need for line upgrades and new substations. Over the past several years, many utilities have begun to implement plans to improve their transmission systems, improve reliability and reduce congestion. These utilities have started or planned new construction, line upgrades and maintenance projects on many transmission systems. We believe that our customers remain committed to the expansion and strengthening of their transmission infrastructure, with planning, engineering and funding for many of their projects already in place. We continue to see opportunities in the Canadian transmission market which we expect will extend over the next several years driven by load center delivery requirements, aging infrastructure, additional hydropower generation development and hydropower interconnection projects to serve Canadian load and the import of hydro power to the United States. 32 TABLE OF CONTENTS We believe that renewable resources in the United States will still be a driver for large transmission project activity under the new administration. State renewable portfolio standards, which set required or voluntary standards for how much electricity is to be generated from renewable energy sources, as well as general environmental concerns, are driving the development of renewable energy projects. The economic feasibility of renewable energy projects, and therefore the attractiveness of investment in the projects, may depend on the availability of tax incentive programs or the ability of the projects to take advantage of such incentives. The late-2015 congressional approval of a five-year extension to the Production Tax Credit and Investment Tax Credit should continue to spur additional wind and solar development, and we believe we will benefit from an increase in these projects. As a result of reduced spending by United States utilities on their distribution systems for several years, we believe there is a continued need for sustained investment by utilities on their distribution systems to properly maintain or meet reliability requirements. In 2016, we saw increased bidding activity in some of our electric distribution markets, as economic conditions improved in those areas. We believe that continued recovery in the United States economy, and in the housing market in particular, over the next few years could provide additional stimulus for spending by our customers on their distribution systems. In addition, we believe there will be a push to strengthen utility distribution systems against major storm-related damage. Several industry and market trends are also prompting customers in the electric utility industry to seek outsourcing partners rather than performing projects internally. These trends include an aging electric utility workforce, increasing costs and staffing constraints. We believe electric utility employee retirements could increase with further economic recovery, which may result in an increase in outsourcing opportunities. We expect to see an incremental increase in distribution opportunities in the United States in 2017 and we believe these opportunities will continue to be bid in a competitive market. We believe we will continue to see significant bidding activity on large transmission projects in 2017 and 2018. The timing of multi-year transmission project awards and substantial construction activity is difficult to predict due to regulatory requirements and right-of-way permits needed to commence construction. Significant construction on any large, multi-year projects awarded in 2017 will not likely occur until 2018. Bidding and construction activity for small to medium-size transmission projects and upgrades remains strong, and we expect this trend to continue in 2017, primarily due to reliability and economic drivers. Competition and the unpredictability of awards in the transmission market may impact our ability to maintain high utilization of equipment and manpower resources which is essential to maintaining contract margins. We saw increased activity in many of our C&I markets in 2016. Results in our C&I segment improved over the prior year due to our strategic acquisitions, organic expansion into new markets and improved economic conditions. We expect to see continued improvement in bidding opportunities in our C&I segment in 2017. We expect the long-term growth in our C&I segment to generally track the economic growth of the regions we serve and benefit to the extent economic conditions continue to improve in the markets we serve. Through 2016, we continued to implement a three-pronged strategy of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and prudent capital returns, which is further detailed below. Additionally, in June 2016, we entered into an amended and restated, five-year credit agreement, which expanded our borrowing capacity to $250 million. This new credit agreement provided added resources and flexibility to execute each of our three-pronged strategy initiatives. Organic Growth In 2016, we expanded our operations at our California office to include C&I services. In 2015, we opened five new offices located in the states of California, Kansas, Nevada, Texas and Washington and began work on our first major project award in Canada. We continue to look for opportunities to expand our operations into new markets in the United States and Canada. A few of our new organic growth initiatives are progressing slower than expected due to the timing of contract awards and penetration of new market, which resulted in uncovered fixed costs for the year ended December 31, 2016. Despite slower starts in these markets, we continued to see improvements in most of our organic growth initiatives throughout 2016, and we believe that our strategy to grow the business will result in positive growth and enhance shareholder value going forward. 33 TABLE OF CONTENTS Strategic Acquisitions On October 28, 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Western Pacific Enterprises GP and certain assets of Western Pacific Enterprises Ltd., with the company continuing operations as Western Pacific Enterprises Ltd. ( WPE ) and in 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of E.S. Boulos Company ( ESB ) and all of the outstanding common stock of High Country Line Construction, Inc. ( HCL ). The acquisition of ESB and HCL has enhanced our T&D presence in the northeast and western United States and further expanded our C&I presence into the northeast United States. WPE expanded our C&I and enhanced our T&D presence in western Canada. We continue to look for acquisition opportunities that are compatible with our culture while enhancing shareholder value. Prudent Capital Returns In February 2016, we increased our share repurchase program by $75.0 million to $142.5 million and revised its provisions to enable us to accelerate the pace of share repurchases. On July 12, 2016, we exhausted the availability under this share repurchase authorization under which we repurchased a total of 6,024,978 shares of our common stock for an average share price of $23.64 per share. In July 2016, we increased the authorization to repurchase our stock by $20.0 million to $162.5 million and extended the terms of the program to August 15, 2017. Additionally, we continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy of reducing future capital spending while expanding our fleet through alternative financing approaches, such as leasing. In March 2016, we entered into master lease arrangements and began to lease vehicles and equipment under these arrangements. We continue to look for opportunities to improve our resource allocation to enhance shareholder value. We continue to invest in developing key management and craft personnel in both our T&D and C&I markets and in procuring the specialty equipment and tooling needed to win and execute projects of all sizes and complexity. In 2016 and 2015, we invested in capital expenditures of approximately $25.4 million and $46.6 million, respectively. Most of our capital expenditures supported opportunities in our T&D business. We plan to continue to evaluate our needs of additional equipment and tooling, with investments being funded substantially through cash flows from operations, cash on hand and draws on our line of credit. Our investment strategy is based on our belief that spending in transmission and distribution projects will continue to remain strong over the next several years as electric utilities, cooperatives and municipalities make up for the lack of infrastructure spending in the past, combined with the overall need to integrate new generation into the electric power grid, and our belief that distribution demand will increase over the next several years. We ended 2016 with $167.2 million available under our line of credit. We believe that our financial position and operational strengths will enable us to manage the current challenges and uncertainties in the markets we serve and give us the flexibility to successfully execute our three-pronged strategy. Understanding Backlog We define backlog as our estimated revenue on uncompleted contracts, including the amount of revenue on contracts for which work has not begun, less the revenue we have recognized under such contracts. Backlog may not accurately represent the revenues that we expect to realize during any particular period. Several factors, such as the timing of contract awards, the type and duration of contracts, and the mix of subcontractor and material costs in our projects, can impact our backlog at any point in time. Some of our revenue does not appear in our periodic backlog reporting because the award of the project, as well as the execution of the work, can all take place within the period. For many of our unit-price, time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts, we only include projected revenue for a three-month period in the calculation of backlog, although these types of contracts are generally awarded as part of MSAs that typically have a one-year to three-year duration from execution. Our backlog only includes projects that have a signed contract or an agreed upon work order to perform work on mutually accepted terms and conditions. Changes in backlog from period to period are primarily the result of fluctuations in the timing of awards and revenue recognition of contracts. 34 TABLE OF CONTENTS Understanding Gross Margins Our gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues. Gross profit is calculated by subtracting contract costs from revenue. Contract costs consist primarily of salaries, wages and benefits to employees, depreciation, fuel and other equipment expenses, equipment rentals, subcontracted services, insurance, facilities expenses, materials and parts and supplies. Various factors affect our gross margins on a quarterly or annual basis, including those listed below. Performance Risk. Margins may fluctuate because of the volume of work and the impacts of pricing and job productivity, which can be impacted both favorably and negatively by customer decisions and crew productivity, as well as other factors. When comparing a service contract between periods, factors affecting the gross margins associated with the revenues generated by the contract may include pricing under the contract, the volume of work performed under the contract, the mix of the type of work specifically being performed, the availability of labor resources at expected labor rates and the productivity of the crews performing the work. Productivity can be influenced by many factors including the experience level of the crew, whether the work is on an open or encumbered right of way, weather conditions, geographical conditions, trade stacking, performance of other sub-trades, schedule changes and effects of environmental restrictions or regulatory delays. Revenue Mix and Contract Terms. The mix of revenue derived from the industries we serve will impact gross margins. Changes in our customers spending patterns in each of the industries we serve can cause an imbalance in supply and demand and, therefore, affect margins and mix of revenue by industry served. Storm restoration services typically command higher profit margins than other maintenance services. Seasonal and weather factors, as noted below, can impact the timing at which customers perform maintenance and repairs, which can cause a shift in the revenue mix. Some of our contracts include shared savings clauses, in which we agree to share savings with our customer, and the timing of such savings can impact our margins. In addition, change orders and claims can impact our margins. Costs related to change orders are recognized in contract costs when incurred but revenue related to change orders is only recognized when it is probable that the change order will result in an addition to contract value and can be reliably estimated. Costs related to claims are recognized in contract costs when incurred, but revenue related to claims is recognized only to the extent that contract costs related to the claim have been incurred and when it is probable that the claim will result in an addition to contract value which can be reliably estimated. No profit is recognized on a claim until final settlement occurs. Seasonal, Weather and Geographical. Seasonal patterns, primarily related to weather conditions and the availability of system outages, can have a significant impact on gross margins in a given period. It is typical during the winter months that parts of the country may experience snow or rainfall, which can affect our crews ability to work efficiently. Additionally, our T&D customers often cannot remove their T&D lines from service during the summer months, when consumer demand for electricity is at its peak, delaying the demand for our maintenance and repair services. In both cases, projects may be delayed or temporarily placed on hold. Conversely, in periods when weather remains dry and temperatures are moderate, more work can be done, sometimes with less cost, which would have a favorable impact on gross margins. The mix of business conducted in different parts of the country will also affect margins, as some parts of the country offer the opportunity for higher margins than others due to the geographic characteristics associated with the physical location where the work is being performed. Such characteristics include whether the project is performed in an urban versus a rural setting; in a mountainous area or in open terrain; or in normal soil conditions or rocky terrain. Site conditions, including unforeseen underground conditions, can also impact margins. Depreciation and Amortization. We include depreciation on equipment and capital lease amortization in contract costs. This is common practice in our industry, but can make comparability to other companies difficult. Over the last few years, we have spent a significant amount of capital on property, facilities and equipment, with the majority of such expenditures being used to purchase additional specialized equipment to enhance our fleet and to reduce our reliance on lease arrangements and short term equipment rentals. We believe the investment in specialized equipment helps to reduce our costs, improve our margins and provide us with valuable flexibility to take on additional and complex projects. In 2016, we increased our use of alternative financing approaches, through capital leasing arrangements for shorter-lived equipment. 35 TABLE OF CONTENTS Service and Maintenance Compared to New Construction. In general, new construction work has a higher gross margin than maintenance and repair work. New construction work is often obtained on a fixed-price basis, which carries a higher risk than other types of pricing arrangements because a contractor can bear the risk of increased expenses. As such, we generally bid fixed-price contracts with higher profit margins. We typically derive approximately 10% to 35% of our revenue from maintenance and repair work that is performed under pre-established or negotiated prices or cost-plus pricing arrangements which generally allow us a set margin above our costs. Thus, the mix between new construction work, at fixed-price, and maintenance and repair work, at cost-plus, in a given period will impact gross margin in that period. Material and Subcontract Costs. Projects that include a greater amount of material or subcontractor costs can experience lower overall project gross margins as we typically add less mark up to material and subcontractor costs in our bids than what we would to our labor and equipment cost. In addition, successful completion of our contracts may depend on whether our subcontractors successfully fulfill their contractual obligations. If our subcontractors fail to satisfactorily perform their contractual obligations as a result of financial or other difficulties, we may be required to incur additional costs and provide additional services in order to make up such shortfalls. Cost of Material . On fixed-price contracts where we are required to provide materials, our overall gross margin may be affected if we experience increases in material quantity or higher commodity costs. Materials versus Labor. Projects that include a greater amount of material cost can experience lower overall project gross margins as we typically add less mark up to material cost in our bids than what we would to our labor and equipment cost. Insurance. Gross margins could be impacted by fluctuations in insurance accruals related to our deductibles and loss history in the period in which such adjustments are made. We carry insurance policies, which were subject to certain deductibles, for workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and other coverages. Losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Fleet Utilization, Estimation, and Bidding. We operate a centrally-managed fleet in an effort to achieve the highest equipment utilization. We also develop internal equipment rates which provide our business units with appropriate cost information to estimate bids for new projects. Availability of equipment for a particular contract is determined by our internal fleet ordering process which is designed to optimize the use of internal fleet assets and allocate equipment costs to individual contracts. We believe these processes allow us to utilize our equipment efficiently, which leads to improved gross margins. Transmission and distribution projects can require different types of equipment. A significant shift in project mix can cause a shift in overall utilization, causing gross margins to vary. Our team of trained estimators helps us to determine potential costs and revenues and make informed decisions on whether to bid for a project and, if bid, the rates to use in estimating the costs for that bid. The ability to accurately estimate labor, equipment, subcontracting and material costs in connection with a new project may affect the gross margins achieved for the project. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation, related benefits and employee costs for management and administrative personnel, office rent and utilities, stock compensation, communications, professional fees, depreciation, marketing costs and bad debt expense. 36 TABLE OF CONTENTS Consolidated Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected statements of operations data and such data as a percentage of revenues for the years indicated: For the year ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2016 2015 2014 Contract revenues $ 1,142,487 100.0 % $ 1,061,681 100.0 % $ 943,967 100.0 % Contract costs 1,007,764 88.2 939,340 88.5 811,553 86.0 Gross profit 134,723 11.8 122,341 11.5 132,414 14.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses 96,424 8.4 79,186 7.5 73,818 7.8 Amortization of intangible assets 886 0.1 571 334 Gain on sale of property and equipment (1,341 ) (0.1 ) (2,257 ) (0.2 ) (142 ) Income from operations 38,754 3.4 44,841 4.2 58,404 6.2 Other income (expense) Interest income 5 25 106 Interest expense (1,299 ) (0.1 ) (741 ) (722 ) (0.1 ) Other income, net 885 0.1 174 162 Income before provision for income taxes 38,345 3.4 44,299 4.2 57,950 6.1 Income tax expense 16,914 1.5 16,997 1.6 21,406 2.2 Net income $ 21,431 1.9 % $ 27,302 2.6 % $ 36,544 3.9 % Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Revenues. Revenues increased $80.8 million, or 7.6%, to $1.142 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1.062 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in revenue was primarily due to organic and acquisitive growth, partially offset by a decline in revenue in some geographic areas. Gross margin. Gross margin increased to 11.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 11.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in gross margin was largely due to improved performance on certain jobs as well as favorable close-outs on several projects, partially offset by costs associated with unrecognized revenue related to pending project claims and change orders. We also experienced inclement weather in some of our markets and lower productivity on other jobs. Changes in estimates of gross profit on certain projects resulted in gross margin decreases of 0.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Changes in estimates of gross profit on certain projects, including large claims or change orders, resulted in gross margin increases of 0.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Gross profit. Gross profit increased $12.4 million, or 10.1%, to $134.7 million for year ended December 31, 2016 from $122.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to higher revenue and improved gross margin. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ), which were $96.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased $17.2 million from $79.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to $9.4 million of costs associated with our organic and acquisitive growth strategies. Bonus and profit sharing costs as well as personnel costs to support our overall growth increased in 2016. We also incurred $1.0 million of costs associated with responding to activist investors. The impact of these increases was partially offset by a $1.4 million cost related to an executive officer transition in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A increased to 8.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 7.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015. 37 TABLE OF CONTENTS Gain on sale of property and equipment. Gains from the sale of property and equipment in the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1.3 million compared to $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Gains from the sale of property and equipment are attributable to routine sales of property and equipment no longer useful or valuable to our ongoing operations. Interest expense. Interest expense was $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $0.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase is primarily attributable to the borrowings on our line of credit during the year ended December 31, 2016. Other Income. Other income was $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $0.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase is primarily attributable to contingent consideration related to margin guarantees of $1.4 million recognized on certain contracts associated with the acquisition of WPE. Income tax expense. The provision for income taxes was $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, with an effective tax rate of 44.1%, compared to a provision of $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, with an effective tax rate of 38.4%. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily caused by the year-to-date impact of lower domestic activities deductions and changes in the mix of business between states. In addition, our effective tax rate increased due to the deferred tax balance true-up for changes in the blended state rate, as well as the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets on certain Canadian subsidiaries. Net income. Net income decreased to $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily for the reasons stated above. Segment Results The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, statements of operations data by segment, segment net sales as a percentage of total net sales and segment operating income as a percentage of segment net sales: For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 (dollars in thousands) Amount Percent Amount Percent Contract revenues: Transmission & Distribution $ 818,972 71.7 % $ 794,898 74.9 % Commercial & Industrial 323,515 28.3 266,783 25.1 Total $ 1,142,487 100.0 $ 1,061,681 100.0 Operating income (loss): Transmission & Distribution $ 63,459 7.7 $ 63,155 7.9 Commercial & Industrial 13,920 4.3 13,592 5.1 Total 77,379 6.8 76,747 7.2 Corporate (38,625 ) (3.4 ) (31,906 ) (3.0 ) Consolidated $ 38,754 3.4 % $ 44,841 4.2 % Transmission & Distribution Revenues for our T&D segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $819.0 million compared to $794.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $24.1 million, or 3.0%. The increase in revenue was primarily due to organic and acquisitive growth, partially offset by a decline in revenue in some geographic areas. 38 TABLE OF CONTENTS Revenues from transmission projects represented 75.8% and 73.9% of T&D segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2016, measured by revenue in our T&D segment, we provided 56.9% of our T&D services under fixed-price contracts, as compared to 48.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating income for our T&D segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $63.4 million compared to $63.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $0.3 million, or 0.5%. The slight increase in operating income was primarily due to operating income associated with our expansion in new geographic markets and favorable project close-outs, offset by lower margins due to unrecognized revenue on a pending project claim and change orders, inclement weather in some of our markets and lower productivity on other jobs. Operating income, as a percentage of revenues, for our T&D segment decreased to 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Commercial & Industrial Revenues for our C&I segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $323.5 million compared to $266.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $56.7 million, or 21.3%, primarily due to organic and acquisitive expansion in new markets. For the year ended December 31, 2016, measured by revenue in our C&I segment, we provided 73.4% of our services under fixed-price contracts, as compared to 71.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating income for our C&I segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $13.9 million compared to $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $0.3 million, or 2.4%. The year-over-year increase in operating income compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to higher revenues and margins experienced on certain projects, partially offset by productivity below our previous estimates and unrecognized revenue related to a pending project claim. Our expansion in new geographic markets provided positive operating income, albeit at a lower operating percentage of revenue, due to slower market penetration experienced in certain geographic areas and contingent consideration related to margin guarantees of $1.4 million classified as other income. As a percentage of revenues, operating income for our C&I segment decreased to 4.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Corporate The increase in corporate expenses in 2016 was primarily attributable to higher bonus and profit sharing costs as well as additional support costs. Additionally we incurred $1.0 million of costs associated with activist investor activities. The impact of these increases was partially offset by a $1.4 million cost related to an executive officer transition in the fourth quarter of 2015. Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Revenues. Revenues increased $117.7 million, or 12.5%, to $1.062 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $944.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher T&D revenues and the acquisition of ESB. We benefited from increased spending by our customers and organic growth from new geographic markets, however, our project mix of shorter-duration projects increased while the number of large, multi-year transmission projects declined. Gross margin. Gross margin decreased to 11.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 14.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gross margin in 2014 benefited from favorable closeouts on several large, multi-year transmission projects. The remaining year-over-year decline in gross margin was primarily due to lower bid margins caused by increased competition in many of our markets and an increase in the number of shorter duration projects (which affects fleet utilization, labor productivity and mobilization and demobilization costs). Additionally, some of our jobs underperformed in 2015 due to labor productivity below previous estimates as a result of excessive labor turnover, rework on certain jobs and severe weather conditions in some of our markets. Changes in estimates of gross profit on certain projects resulted in gross margin increases of 0.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Changes in estimates of gross profit on certain projects, including several large claims or change orders, resulted in gross margin increases of 1.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. 39 TABLE OF CONTENTS Gross profit. Gross profit decreased $10.1 million, or 7.6%, to $122.3 million for year ended December 31, 2015 from $132.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to lower gross margin partially offset by higher revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, which were $79.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased $5.4 million from $73.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to higher personnel and overhead costs to support our organic and acquisitive geographic market expansion, the impact of reversing a $2.3 million legal reserve in the fourth quarter in 2014, $1.4 million related to an executive officer transition and costs associated with the ESB and HCL acquisitions, partially offset by lower bonus and profit sharing costs. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 7.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 7.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gain on sale of property and equipment. Gains from the sale of property and equipment in the year ended December 31, 2015 were $2.3 million compared to $0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Gains from the sale of property and equipment are attributable to routine sales of property and equipment no longer useful or valuable to our ongoing operations. Interest expense. Interest expense was $0.7 million for both of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Income tax expense. The provision for income taxes was $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, with an effective tax rate of 38.4%, compared to a provision of $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, with an effective tax rate of 36.9%. The increase in the effective rate was primarily caused by changes in the mix of business between states and the impact of the foreign tax differential. Net income. Net income decreased to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $36.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily for the reasons stated above. Segment Results The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, statements of operations data by segment, segment net sales as a percentage of total net sales and segment operating income as a percentage of segment net sales: For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 (dollars in thousands) Amount Percent Amount Percent Contract revenues: Transmission & Distribution $ 794,898 74.9 % $ 699,595 74.1 % Commercial & Industrial 266,783 25.1 244,372 25.9 Total $ 1,061,681 100.0 $ 943,967 100.0 Operating income (loss): Transmission & Distribution $ 63,155 7.9 $ 75,439 10.8 Commercial & Industrial 13,592 5.1 16,542 6.8 Total 76,747 7.2 91,981 9.7 Corporate (31,906 ) (3.0 ) (33,577 ) (3.5 ) Consolidated $ 44,841 4.2 % $ 58,404 6.2 % Transmission & Distribution Revenues for our T&D segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $794.9 million compared to $699.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $95.3 million or 13.6%. While we benefited from increased spending by our customers, our project mix shifted away from large, multi-year transmission projects and included more shorter-duration projects. 40 TABLE OF CONTENTS Revenues from transmission projects represented 73.9% and 77.8% of T&D segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2015, measured by revenue in our T&D segment, we provided 48.4% of our T&D services under fixed-price contracts, as compared to 53.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income for our T&D segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $63.1 million compared to $75.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income in 2014 benefited from favorable closeouts on several large, multi-year transmission projects. The remaining year-over-year decline in operating income was primarily due to lower bid margins caused by increased competition in many of our markets and an increase in the number of shorter duration projects (which affects fleet utilization, labor productivity and mobilization and demobilization costs). Additionally, some of our jobs underperformed in 2015 due to labor productivity below previous estimates, incremental costs associated with expansion into new geographic markets and severe weather conditions in some of our markets, partially offset by higher revenues. Operating income, as a percentage of revenues, for our T&D segment decreased to 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 10.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Commercial & Industrial Revenues for our C&I segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $266.8 million compared to $244.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $22.4 million or 9.2%, due primarily to the acquisition of ESB. For the year ended December 31, 2015, measured by revenue in our C&I segment, we provided 71.6% of our services under fixed-price contracts, as compared to 41.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income for our C&I segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $13.6 million compared to $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 17.6%. The year-over-year decline in operating income compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to lower bid margins caused by increased competition in many of our markets and certain underperforming jobs due to labor productivity below previous estimates as a result of excessive labor turnover and rework and incremental costs associated with expansion into new geographic markets, partially offset by higher revenues. As a percentage of revenues, operating income for our C&I segment decreased to 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Corporate The decrease in corporate expenses in 2015 was primarily attributable to lower bonus and profit sharing costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had working capital of $129.3 million and $123.6 million, respectively. We define working capital as current assets less current liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2016, operating activities of our business provided net cash of $54.5 million, compared to $43.0 million of cash provided for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our services, operating margins, timing of contract performance and the type of services we provide to our customers. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for changes in operating assets and liabilities and non-cash items including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, and the gain on sale of property and equipment. The change in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a $12.9 million favorable change in operating assets and liabilities and a $4.5 million increase in non-cash items which were partially offset by a decrease of $5.9 million in net income. The change in operating assets and liabilities relates to an increased use of funds of $13.3 million from our key operating assets and liabilities ( accounts receivable, net , including retention; costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts; accounts payable; and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts) primarily related to increased volume and timing of work along with timing of contractual billing terms on certain projects. This was more than offset by year-over-year changes in the timing and amount of accrued payroll costs and a decrease in refundable taxes. 41 TABLE OF CONTENTS During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we used net cash of $34.1 million and $56.9 million, respectively, in investing activities. The $34.1 million of cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of $25.3 million for capital expenditures and $12.1 million to acquire WPE, partially offset by $3.3 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment. The $56.9 million of cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of $46.6 million for capital expenditures and $13.1 million to acquire ESB and HCL, partially offset by $2.8 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we used net cash of $35.5 million and $23.9 million, respectively, in financing activities. The $35.5 million of cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016, consisted primarily of $101.5 million of cash used to purchase shares of our common stock, as well as $1.0 million of cash used to pay debt issuance costs related to our new line of credit. These uses of cash were partially offset by borrowings of $59.1 million, $6.2 million of proceeds from stock options and $2.3 million of tax benefits related to our stock compensation programs. The $23.9 million of cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of $27.6 million of cash used to purchase shares of our common stock, which was partially offset by proceeds from stock options and tax benefits related to our stock compensation programs. During 2016, our Board of Directors approved two amendments to our share repurchase program, which increased the program from $67.5 million to $162.5 million and extended the term of the program through August 15, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we had $20.0 million of remaining availability to purchase shares under the Repurchase Program. We anticipate that our $167.2 million borrowing availability under our 2016 Facility, and future cash flow from operations will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our future operating needs, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, and acquisition and joint venture opportunities. We expect that our repurchases of common stock will be at lower levels than experienced in 2015 and 2016. Although we believe that we have adequate cash and availability under our Credit Agreement to meet our liquidity needs, any large projects or acquisitions may require additional capital. We have not historically paid dividends and currently do not expect to pay dividends. Debt Instruments On June 30, 2016, we entered into a five-year amended and restated credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with a syndicate of banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. The Credit Agreement provides for a facility of $250 million (the 2016 Facility ) that may be used for revolving loans and letters of credit. The 2016 Facility also allows for revolving loans and letters of credit in Canadian dollars and other currencies, up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $50 million. We have an expansion option to increase the commitments under the 2016 Facility or enter into incremental term loans, subject to certain conditions, by up to an additional $100 million upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. Subject to certain exceptions, the 2016 Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries and by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of our direct foreign subsidiaries. Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, our domestic subsidiaries also guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the Credit Agreement. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding under the 2016 Facility may be accelerated and may become or be declared immediately due and payable. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to refinance existing debt and are expected to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, stock repurchases, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement in U.S. dollars bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either (1) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 1.00%; or (2) Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.00%. Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement in any currency other than U.S. dollars bear interest at a rate equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.00%. The applicable margin is determined based on our consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Letters of credit issued under the 2016 Facility are subject to a letter of 42 TABLE OF CONTENTS credit fee of 1.125% to 2.125% for standby or commercial letters of credit or 0.625% to 1.125% for performance letters of credit, based on the our consolidated Leverage Ratio. We are subject to a commitment fee of 0.20% to 0.375% based on our consolidated Leverage Ratio on any unused portion of the 2016 Facility. The Credit Agreement restricts certain types of payments when our consolidated Leverage Ratio exceeds 2.25. Under the Credit Agreement, we are subject to certain financial covenants and must maintain a maximum consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0, which is defined in the Credit Agreement as Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) divided by interest expense. The Credit Agreement also contains a number of covenants, including limitations on asset sales, investments, indebtedness and liens. In connection with any permitted acquisition where the total consideration exceeds $50 million, we may request that the maximum permitted consolidated Leverage Ratio increase from 3.0 to 3.5. Any such increase, if given effect, shall begin in the quarter in which such permitted acquisition is consummated and shall continue in effect for four consecutive fiscal quarters. Prior to the amendment and restatement of the Credit Agreement, we had a five-year syndicated credit agreement with a facility of $175.0 million (the 2011 Facility ). The 2011 Facility provided funds for revolving loans and the issuance of letters of credit and up to $25.0 million for swingline loans. As of December 31, 2016, we had $59.1 million of debt outstanding under the 2016 Facility and irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately $23.7 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had no debt outstanding and irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately $19.3 million. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As is common in our industry, we enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets. Our significant off-balance sheet transactions include liabilities associated with non-cancelable operating leases, letter of credit obligations and bond guarantees entered into in the normal course of business. We have not engaged in any off-balance sheet financing arrangements through special purpose entities. Leases We enter into non-cancelable leases for some of our facility, vehicle and equipment needs. These leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for the use of facilities, vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them. Leases are accounted for as operating or capital leases, depending on the terms of the lease. We may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term, in which case we are typically liable to the lessor for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease. At December 31, 2016, we had no leases with residual value guarantees. We typically have purchase options on the equipment underlying our long-term operating leases and many of our short-term rental arrangements. We exercise some of these purchase options when the need for equipment is on-going and the purchase option price is attractive. Purchase Commitments for Construction Equipment As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $8.6 million in outstanding purchase obligations for certain construction equipment to be paid, with cash outlay scheduled to occur over the first four months of 2017. Letters of Credit Some of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf, such as to beneficiaries under our insurance programs. In addition, from time-to-time certain customers require us to post letters of credit to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts and to guarantee performance under our contracts. Such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution. The letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder claims that we have failed to perform specified actions in accordance with the terms of the letter of credit. If this were to occur, we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement, we may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. Currently, we do not believe that it is likely that any claims will be made under any letter of credit. 43 TABLE OF CONTENTS At December 31, 2016, we had $23.7 million in irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Agreement at an interest rate of 1.125%, including $17.6 million related to the Company payment obligation under its insurance programs and approximately $6.1 million related to contract performance obligations. As of December 31, 2015, we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately $19.3 million, including $17.5 million related to the Company payment obligation under its insurance programs and approximately $1.8 million related to contract performance obligations. Performance and Payment Bonds Many customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety. These bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs. Under our continuing indemnity and security agreements with our sureties, with the consent of our lenders under the Credit Agreement, we have granted security interests in certain of our assets to collateralize our obligations to the surety. We may be required to post letters of credit or other collateral in favor of the surety or our customers. Posting letters of credit in favor of the surety or our customers reduces the borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement. To date, we have not been required to make any reimbursements to any of our sureties for bond-related costs. We believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund significant claims under our surety arrangements. As of December 31, 2016, an aggregate of approximately $887.7 million in original face amount of bonds issued by our sureties were outstanding. Our estimated remaining cost to complete these bonded projects was approximately $58.2 million as of December 31, 2016. Indemnities From time to time, pursuant to our service arrangements, we indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide under those service arrangements. These indemnification obligations may subject us to indemnity claims, liabilities and related litigation. We are not aware of any material unrecorded liabilities for asserted claims in connection with these indemnification obligations. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2016, our future contractual obligations are as follows: (in thousands) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Other Short and long term debt $ 59,070 $ $ $ 59,070 $ $ Operating lease obligations 9,205 2,519 4,107 1,967 612 Capital lease obligations 5,260 1,220 2,440 1,600 Purchase obligations 8,558 8,558 Income tax contingencies 301 301 Total $ 82,394 $ 12,297 $ 6,547 $ 62,637 $ 612 $ 301 Excluded from the above table are interest and fees associated with our short term and long term debt and irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding under our 2016 Facility, because the applicable interest rates and fees are variable. We have also excluded our multi-employer pension plan contributions, which are determined annually, based on our union employee payrolls, and which cannot be determined for future periods in advance. The amount of income tax contingencies has been presented in the Other column in the table above due to the fact that the period of future payment cannot be reliably estimated. For further information, refer to Note 10 to the Financial Statements. 44 TABLE OF CONTENTS Concentration of Credit Risk We grant trade credit under contractual payment terms, generally without collateral, to our customers, which include high credit quality electric utilities, governmental entities, general contractors and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties. Consequently, we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors. However, we generally have certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. Under certain circumstances such as foreclosures or negotiated settlements, we may take title to the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of receivables. As of December 31, 2016, one customer individually exceeded 10.0% of accounts receivable with approximately 11.2% of the total accounts receivable amount (excluding the impact of allowance for doubtful accounts). As of December 31, 2015, one customer individually exceeded 10.0% of accounts receivable with approximately 13.0% of the total accounts receivable amount (excluding the impact of allowance for doubtful accounts). Management believes the terms and conditions in our contracts, billing and collection policies are adequate to minimize the potential credit risk. Inflation Inflation did not have a significant effect on our results during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014. New Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. We believe the following accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Financial Statements: Revenue Recognition. Revenues under long-term contracts are accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the contract term based on costs incurred under the cost-to-cost method. Revenues from our construction services are performed under fixed-price, time-and-equipment, time-and-materials, unit-price, and cost-plus fee contracts. For fixed-price and unit-price contracts, we use the ratio of cost incurred to date on the contract (excluding uninstalled direct materials) to management estimate of the contract total cost, to determine the percentage of completion on each contract. This method is used as management considers expended costs to be the best available measure of progression of these contracts. Contract cost includes all direct costs on contracts, including labor and material, subcontractor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as supplies, fuel, tool repairs and depreciation. We recognize revenues from construction services with fees based on time-and-materials, or cost-plus fee as the services are performed and amounts are earned. If contracts include contract incentive or bonus provisions, they are included in estimated contract revenues only when the achievement of such incentive or bonus is reasonably certain. Contract costs incurred to date and expected total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract. Changes in job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence management assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts and therefore, our profit recognition. These changes, which include contracts with estimated costs in excess of estimated revenues, are recognized in contract costs in the period in which the revisions are 45 TABLE OF CONTENTS determined. At the point we anticipate a loss on a contract, we estimate the ultimate loss through completion and recognize that loss in the period in which the possible loss was identified. A change order is a modification to a contract that changes the provisions of the contract, typically resulting from changes in scope, specifications, design, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites, or period of completion of the work under the contract. A claim is an amount in excess of the agreed-upon contract price that the Company seeks to collect from its clients or others for client-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders that are either in dispute or are unapproved as to both scope and price, or other causes. Costs related to change orders and claims are recognized when incurred. Revenue from a change order is included in total estimated contract revenue when it is probable that the change order will result in an addition to contract value and can be reliably estimated. Revenue from a claim is included in total estimated contract revenues, only to the extent that contract costs related to the claim have been incurred, when it is probable that the claim will result in an addition to contract value which can be reliably estimated. No profit is recognized on a claim until final settlement occurs. The accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project. Cost estimates for all of our significant projects use a detailed bottoms up approach and we believe our experience typically allows us to provide materially reliable estimates. There are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability. The most significant of these include, among others: the completeness and accuracy of the original bid; costs associated with scope changes, change orders or claims; costs of labor and/or materials; extended overhead due to owner, weather and other delays; subcontractor performance issues; changes in productivity expectations; site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid (to the extent contract remedies are unavailable); the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project; and a change in the availability and proximity of equipment and materials. The foregoing factors as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods. We provide warranties to customers on a basis customary to the industry; however, the warranty period does not typically exceed one year. Historically, warranty claims have not been material. Total revenues do not include sales tax as we consider ourselves a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes. Sales tax and value added tax collected from customers is included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Insurance. We carry insurance policies, which are subject to certain deductibles, for workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and other coverages. Our deductible for each line of coverage is up to $1.0 million, except for certain health benefit plans, which are subject to a deductible up to $0.2 million, for qualified individuals. Losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. The insurance and claims accruals are based on known facts, actuarial estimates and historical trends. While recorded accruals are based on the ultimate liability, which includes amounts in excess of the deductible, a corresponding receivable for amounts in excess of the deductible is included in current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. 46 TABLE OF CONTENTS Stock-Based Compensation. We determine compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the estimated fair values at the grant date and recognize the related compensation expense over the vesting period. We use the straight-line attribution method to recognize compensation expense related to stock-based awards, such as restricted stock and phantom stock, that have only service conditions. This method recognizes stock compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. We recognize compensation expense related to performance awards that vest based on internal performance metrics and service conditions on a straight-line basis over the service period, but adjust inception-to-date expense based upon our determination of the potential achievement of the performance target at each reporting date. We recognize compensation expense related to performance awards with market-based performance metrics on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense is adjusted for changes in estimated and actual forfeitures. We use historical data to estimate the forfeiture rate that we use; however, these estimates are subject to change and may impact the value that will ultimately be recognized as stock compensation expense. Shares issued under the Company stock-based compensation program are taken out of authorized but unissued shares. Goodwill and Intangibles. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis at the beginning of the fourth quarter, or when circumstances change, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or the decision to sell a business, both of which would indicate that impairment may have occurred. We perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two-step goodwill impairment test. The qualitative assessment considers financial, industry, segment and macroeconomic factors. If the qualitative assessment indicates a potential for impairment, the two-step method is used to determine if impairment exists. The two-step method begins with a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the process involves a comparison of the implied fair value and carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit. The company also performs a qualitative assessment on intangible assets with indefinite lives. If the qualitative assessment indicates a potential for impairment, a quantitative impairment test would be performed to compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite lived assets exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded in the statement of operations. In 2015, we determined, based on our qualitative analysis, that it was appropriate to perform a two-step analysis. The first step involves a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the process involves a comparison of the implied fair value and carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recorded in the statement of operations. The step one analysis did not indicate that our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets were impaired. As a result, no step two analysis was performed. As a result of the annual qualitative review process in 2016 and 2014, we determined it was not necessary to perform a two-step analysis. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We do not generally charge interest to our customers, and we carry our customer receivables at their face amounts, less an allowance for doubtful accounts. Included in accounts receivable are balances billed to customers pursuant to retainage provisions in certain contracts that are due upon completion of the contracts and acceptance by the customer, or earlier, as provided by the contract. Based on our experience in recent years, the majority of customer balances at each balance sheet date are collected within twelve months. As is common practice in the industry, we classify all accounts receivable, including retainage, as current assets. The contracting cycle for certain long-term contracts may extend beyond one year, and accordingly, collection of retainage on those contracts may extend beyond one year. 47 TABLE OF CONTENTS We grant trade credit, on a non-collateralized basis (with the exception of lien rights against the property in certain cases) to our customers, and we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and overall economic activity. We analyze specific accounts receivable balances, historical bad debts, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In the event that a customer balance is deemed to be uncollectible the account balance is written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts.
