ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors . Business Overview We are a leading omni-channel sporting goods retailer offering an extensive assortment of authentic, high-quality sports equipment, apparel, footwear and accessories. In addition to DICK S Sporting Goods stores, we own and operate Golf Galaxy, Public Lands and Going Going Gone! specialty concept stores, and also offer our products online and through our mobile apps. We also own and operate DICK S House of Sport and Golf Galaxy Performance Center, as well as GameChanger, a youth sports mobile platform for live streaming, scheduling, communications and scorekeeping. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires or specifies, any reference to year is to our fiscal year, which ends on the Saturday closest to the end of January each year. Through our strategic pillars of athlete experience, differentiated product, brand engagement and teammate experience, we have transformed our business to drive sustained profitable growth. As part of our strategy, we have meaningfully improved our merchandise assortment through our vertical brands and strong relationships with our key brand partners, which provide access to highly differentiated products. We have also enhanced our store selling culture and service model and incorporated additional experiential elements and technology into our stores to further engage our athletes. Lastly, we continue to innovate our omni-channel athlete experience through our DICK S House of Sport stores, Golf Galaxy Performance Centers and our DICK S Field House stores, and believe that a key driver of our future omni-channel growth will include repositioning our store portfolio to grow these stores. In addition to these strategies and foundational improvements, consumers have also made what we believe will be lasting lifestyle changes in recent years, prioritizing sport and maintaining healthy, active lifestyles, which has increased demand for our products. We believe there is strength and momentum in the sports industry in the United States and expect this trend to continue in the near term, with continued excitement around women sports, the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Olympics. We believe that the convergence of sport and culture has never been stronger and we believe we re well-positioned for this opportunity. From this position of strength, we plan to make investments in digital and in-store opportunities to grow our market share through repositioning our store portfolio, driving our footwear category and accelerating our eCommerce channel. Business Optimization During 2023, we completed a business optimization to better align our talent, organizational design and spending in support of our most critical strategies while also streamlining our overall cost structure (the Business Optimization ). As part of our Business Optimization, we eliminated certain positions primarily at our customer support center and optimized our outdoor business, which included the integration of our Moosejaw and Public Lands operations, decisions about their go-forward inventory assortment and a comprehensive review of their store portfolios and closure of ten Moosejaw stores. We incurred pre-tax charges of $84.8 million from our Business Optimization, including $46.1 million of non-cash impairments of store and intangible assets, $26.7 million of severance-related costs and a $12.0 million write-down of inventory. Business Environment The macroeconomic environment in which we operate remains dynamic as a result of numerous factors, including ongoing elevated interest rates, inflationary pressures, potential changes to international trade relations from taxation and tariffs, which could impact pricing, consumer discretionary spending behavior and the promotional landscape in which we operate, as well as higher levels of inventory shrink, which has been noted throughout the retail industry. Despite the dynamic macroeconomic environment and a shorter traditional holiday shopping season, we continued to drive comparable sales growth in fiscal 2024 with an increase of 5.2% which is on top of a 2.6% increase in 2023. Through the execution of our core strategies and operational strength, net sales increased 3.5% in fiscal 2024 as compared to 2023, and pre-tax income as a percentage of net sales grew to 11.30% in fiscal 2024 compared to 10.15% in fiscal 2023. 29 Table of Contents Overview of other trends affecting 2024 The prior year included an extra week of operations, which added $170.2 million of net sales, or $0.19 per diluted share to fiscal 2023 full year results. Within merchandise margin, while inventory shrink remains elevated compared to historical levels, inventory shrink as a percentage of net sales decreased 25 basis points during the current year compared to 2023, as the prior year included a cumulative unfavorable impact from shrink identified during our physical inventories. We do not expect a similar decrease in 2025. During 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately flat as a percentage of net sales compared to 2023 due to last year Business Optimization, offset by strategic investments beginning in 2024 to drive long-term growth based upon the strength of our business. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to deleverage year-over-year in fiscal 2025 as we continue with these investments spanning across digital, in-store and marketing. As a result of our strong fiscal 2024 performance, confidence in our strategic initiatives and operational strength, balanced against the macroeconomic environment and our planned investments, we have provided our full year outlook for 2025 and expect comparable sales growth for the year to be in the range of 1% to 3% and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $13.80 to $14.40. The Company current expectations described above include forward-looking statements. Please see the Forward-Looking Statements section in this Annual report on Form 10-K for information regarding important factors that may cause the Company actual results to differ from those currently projected and/or otherwise materially affect the Company. How We Evaluate Our Operations Senior management focuses on certain key indicators to monitor our performance, including: Comparable sales performance Our management considers comparable sales, which includes digital revenue, to be an important indicator of our current performance. Comparable sales results are important to leverage our costs, which include occupancy costs, store payroll and other store expenses. Comparable sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales, net income, cash and working capital. A store is included in the comparable sales calculation during the fiscal period that it commences its 14th full month of operations. Relocated stores are included in the comparable sales calculation from the open date of the original location. Stores that were permanently closed during the applicable period have been excluded from comparable sales results. Our digital revenue includes all eCommerce sales, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled by our stores, GameChanger subscriptions as well as revenue from our DICK S Media Network. For further discussion of our comparable sales refer to the Results of Operations section herein. Earnings before taxes and the related operating margin Our management views operating margin and earnings before taxes as key indicators of our performance. The key drivers of earnings before taxes are comparable sales, gross profit, and our ability to control selling, general and administrative expenses. Cash flows from operating activities Cash flow generation supports our general liquidity needs and funds capital expenditures for our omni-channel platform, which include investments in new and existing stores and our eCommerce channel, distribution and administrative facilities, continuous improvements to information technology tools, potential strategic acquisitions or investments that may arise from time-to-time and stockholder return initiatives, including cash dividends and share repurchases. We typically experience lower operating cash flows in our first and third fiscal quarters due to the timing of inventory purchases in advance of our peak selling periods and anticipated higher cash flows during our second and fourth fiscal quarters. For further discussion of our cash flows refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section herein. Quality of merchandise offerings To measure effectiveness of our merchandise offerings, we monitor sell-throughs, inventory turns, gross margins and markdown rates at the department and style level. This analysis helps us manage inventory levels to reduce working capital requirements and deliver optimal gross margins by improving merchandise flow and establishing appropriate price points to minimize markdowns. Store productivity To assess store-level performance, we monitor various indicators, including sales per square foot, store operating contribution margin and store cash flow. 30 Table of Contents Executive Summary Net sales increased 3.5% to $13.44 billion during the 52 weeks ended February 1, 2025, from $12.98 billion during the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2024, which included an increase in comparable sales of 5.2% on a 52-week to 52-week basis, following a 2.6% increase in the prior year. Fiscal 2023 included $170.2 million of net sales for the 53 rd week. We reported net income of $1.17 billion, or $14.05 per diluted share, in fiscal 2024 , compared to $1.05 billion, or $12.18 per diluted share, during fiscal 2023 . Fiscal 2023 net income included business optimization charges of $62.8 million, net of tax, or $0.73 per diluted share. Additionally, fiscal 2023 earnings per diluted share included approximately $0.19 from the 53rd week. In addition, during fiscal 2024, we: Declared and paid aggregate cash dividends on a quarterly basis for a total amount of $4.40 per share on our common stock and Class B common stock; and Repurchased 1.3 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $268.0 million.

Revenue from eCommerce sales, including vendor-direct sales arrangements, is recognized upon shipment of merchandise. A provision for anticipated merchandise returns is provided through a reduction of sales and cost of goods sold in the period that the related sales are recorded. Revenue from gift cards and returned merchandise credits (collectively the cards ) is deferred and recognized upon the redemption of the cards. The cards have no expiration date. Subscription revenue from our GameChanger platform is recognized ratably over the subscription period with our customers. (2) Cost of goods sold includes: the cost of merchandise and services (inclusive of vendor allowances, inventory shrinkage and inventory write-downs for the lower of cost or net realizable value and GameChanger costs); freight; distribution; shipping; and store occupancy costs. We define merchandise margin as net sales less the cost of merchandise and services sold. Store occupancy costs include rent, common area maintenance charges, real estate and other asset-based taxes, general maintenance, utilities, depreciation and certain insurance expenses. (3) Selling, general and administrative expenses include payroll and fringe benefits for our stores, field support, administrative and our GameChanger platform, advertising, bank card charges, operating costs associated with our internal eCommerce platform, technology, other store expenses and all expenses associated with operating our customer support center. (4) Pre-opening expenses, which consist primarily of rent, marketing, including grand opening advertising costs, payroll, recruiting and other store preparation costs are expensed as incurred. Rent is recognized within pre-opening expense from the date the Company takes possession of a site through the date of store opening and during periods when stores are closed for remodeling. Beginning in fiscal 2024, the Company now reflects grand opening advertising costs within pre-opening expenses, which were historically included within selling, general and administrative expenses. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. (5) Beginning in fiscal 2024, we revised our method for calculating comparable sales to include GameChanger revenue. Prior year information has been revised to reflect this change for comparability purposes. See additional details as furnished in Exhibit 99.2 of the Company Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024. Note - As retailers vary in how they record costs of operating their stores and supply chain between cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses, our gross profit rate and selling, general and administrative expenses rate may not be comparable to other retailers. For additional information regarding the types of costs classified within cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses or any other financial statement line items presented herein, refer to Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Part IV. Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 32 Table of Contents A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended February 1, 2025 (Fiscal 2024) compared to the year ended February 3, 2024 (Fiscal 2023) is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for Fiscal 2023 compared to the year ended January 28, 2023 (Fiscal 2022) can be found under Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024, filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024. Fiscal 2024 (52 weeks) Compared to Fiscal 2023 (53 weeks) Net Sales Net sales increased 3.5% to $13.44 billion in 2024 from $12.98 billion in 2023, primarily due to an increase in comparable sales on a 52-week to 52-week basis of 5.2%, or $641.8 million, partially offset by the inclusion of $170.2 million of net sales during fiscal 2023 from the 53 rd week. The remaining decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to Moosejaw and other store closures, partially offset by an increase from new stores, including DICK S House of Sport and Golf Galaxy Performance Center locations. The increase in comparable sales included a 4.0% increase in sales per transaction and a 1.2% increase in transactions, and reflects growth in footwear, athletic apparel, accessories and hydration, offset by declines in outdoor-related categories including hunt, apparel and equipment, and fitness. Income from Operations Income from operations increased to $1,473.9 million in 2024 from $1,282.4 million in 2023. Gross profit increased to $4,825.7 million in 2024 from $4,533.7 million in 2023 and increased as a percentage of net sales by 98 basis points. Merchandise margins as a percentage of net sales increased 64 basis points as a result of a favorable sales mix and the quality of our assortment, a 25 basis point decrease in inventory shrink from the prior year, which included a cumulative unfavorable impact from shrink identified during our physical inventories, and a $12.0 million write-down of inventory in the prior year related to our Business Optimization. Occupancy costs, which after the cost of merchandise represents the largest item within our cost of goods sold, are generally fixed on a per store basis and fluctuate based on the number of stores that we operate, increased $38.7 million compared to 2023 and were approximately flat as a percent of net sales primarily due to the increase in net sales. The remaining increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was driven by lower eCommerce shipping and fulfillment costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $3,294.3 million in the current year from $3,183.5 million in 2023, and were approximately flat as a percentage of net sales compared to 2023, primarily due to the current year increase in net sales. The $110.7 million increase includes strategic investments across technology and marketing, along with higher incentive compensation, partially offset by Business Optimization charges of $72.8 million incurred in the prior year. The current period also includes a $9.7 million expense increase related to changes in the investment values of our deferred compensation plans, which is fully offset in Other Income. Pre-opening expenses decreased to $57.5 million in the current year from $67.8 million in 2023. Pre-opening expenses in any period fluctuate depending on the timing and number of new store openings and relocations. The current year period includes pre-opening expenses to support the opening of seven DICK S House of Sport stores, compared to nine in the prior year period. Other Income Other income totaled $98.1 million in 2024 compared to $93.8 million in 2023, and includes a $9.7 million expense decrease compared to the prior year from changes in our deferred compensation plan investment values driven by performance in equity markets. The Company recognizes investment income or investment expense to reflect changes in deferred compensation plan investment values with an offsetting charge or reduction to selling, general and administrative costs for the same amount. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate increased to 23.3% in the current year from 20.6% in 2023. Last year effective tax rate reflected $36.8 million higher excess tax benefits compared to the current year from a higher number of employee equity awards vesting and exercised in the prior year. 33 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash on hand as of February 1, 2025 was $1.7 billion. We believe that we have sufficient cash flows from operations and cash on hand to operate our business for at least the next twelve months, supplemented by funds available under our unsecured $1.6 billion Credit Facility, if necessary. We may require additional funding should we pursue strategic acquisitions, undertake share repurchases, pursue other investments or engage in store expansion rates in excess of historical levels. We had no revolving credit facility borrowings at any point during 2024. The following sections describe the potential short and long-term impacts to our liquidity and capital requirements. Leases We lease substantially all of our stores, three of our distribution centers, and certain equipment under non-cancellable operating leases that expire at various dates through 2042. Approximately three-quarters of our DICK S Sporting Goods stores will be up for lease renewal at our option over the next five years, and we plan to leverage the significant flexibility within our existing real estate portfolio to capitalize on future real estate opportunities. Refer to Part IV. Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, Note 7 Leases for further information. Revolving Credit Facility We have a $1.6 billion Credit Facility, which includes a maximum amount of $75 million to be issued in the form of letters of credit. Loans under the Credit Facility bear interest at an alternate base rate or an adjusted secured overnight financing rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin percentage. As of February 1, 2025, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility, and we have total remaining borrowing capacity, after adjusting for $19.9 million of standby letters of credit, of $1.58 billion. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility agreement at February 1, 2025. Refer to Part IV. Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, Note 8 Revolving Credit Facility for further information. Senior Notes As of February 1, 2025, we have $750 million principal amount of senior notes due 2032 (the 2032 Notes ) and $750 million principal amount of senior notes due 2052 outstanding (the 2052 Notes and together with the 2032 Notes, the Senior Notes ). Cash interest accrues at a rate of 3.15% per year on the 2032 Notes and 4.10% per year on the 2052 Notes, each of which are payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15. Refer to Part IV. Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, Note 9 Senior Notes for further information. As of February 1, 2025, our Senior Notes have long-term credit ratings by Moody and Standard & Poor rating agencies of Baa2 and BBB, respectively. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures are primarily allocated toward the development of our omni-channel platform, including investments in new and existing stores and eCommerce technology, while we have also invested in our supply chain and corporate technology capabilities. In 2024, capital expenditures totaled $802.6 million on a gross basis and $726.3 million on a net basis, inclusive of construction allowances provided by landlords. We anticipate 2025 capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion, net of construction allowances provided by landlords. As we continue to reposition our store portfolio, these investments will be concentrated in store growth, relocations and improvements in our existing stores. We plan to open approximately 16 DICK S House of Sport locations in 2025 and expect to begin construction on approximately 20 locations scheduled to open throughout 2026. By the end of 2027, we expect to have between 75 to 100 DICK S House of Sport locations across the country. We also plan to open approximately 18 DICK S Field House and 14 Golf Galaxy Performance Center locations in 2025. By leveraging our real estate flexibility, we expect approximately 70% of our 2025 store openings will be relocations or remodels of existing store locations, which will increase our square footage in 2025 by approximately 3%. Our 2025 capital expenditures plan also includes ongoing investments in our supply chain and technology, including the construction of a new regional distribution center in Fort Worth, Texas, which is expected to open in 2026 and investments in technology to enhance our store fulfillment, in-store pickup and other foundational capabilities to drive efficiencies and enhance the omni-channel athlete experience. Additionally, we plan to invest in emerging growth opportunities with our GameChanger platform and DICK S Media Network. 34 Table of Contents Share Repurchases From time-to-time, we may opportunistically repurchase shares of our common stock under our current $2 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors on December 16, 2021. In 2024, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $268.0 million. As of February 1, 2025, the available amount remaining under the December 2021 share repurchase program is $511.5 million. On March 10, 2025, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an additional five-year share repurchase program of up to $3 billion of the Company's common stock. The 2021 program will remain available for purchases until it is exhausted or expires. Any future share repurchase programs are subject to authorization by our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon future earnings, cash flows, financial requirements and other factors. Dividends In 2024, we paid $361.7 million of dividends to our stockholders. On March 10, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend compared to the previous quarterly per share amount. The dividend of $1.2125 per share of common stock and Class B common stock is payable on April 11, 2025 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 28, 2025. The declaration of future dividends and the establishment of the per share amount, record dates and payment dates for any such future dividends are subject to authorization by our Board of Directors and are dependent upon multiple factors including future earnings, cash flows, financial requirements and other considerations. Supply Chain Financing We have entered into supply chain financing arrangements with certain third-party financial institutions, whereby suppliers have the opportunity to settle outstanding payment obligations early at a discount. We do not have an economic interest in suppliers voluntary participation and we do not provide any guarantees or pledge assets under these arrangements. Supplier invoices are settled with the third-party financial institutions in accordance with the original supplier payment terms and our rights and obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted by these arrangements. Liabilities associated with the funded participation in these arrangements, which are presented within accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $49.6 million and $45.9 million as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, respectively. Cash Flows Changes in cash and cash equivalents for the last three fiscal years are as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2025 February 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,311,835 $ 1,527,335 $ 921,881 Net cash used in investing activities (796,558) (614,676) (392,894) Net cash used in financing activities (626,131) (1,035,748) (1,247,636) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (426) (77) (170) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (111,280) $ (123,166) $ (718,819) Operating Activities Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $215.5 million in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to changes in inventory levels and accounts payable, which decreased operating cash flows by $354.3 million and reflects our investments in key categories to support our sales growth, partially offset by higher earnings. The remaining change in cash flows provided by operating activities was driven by working capital changes resulting from year-over-year changes in incentive compensation accruals and corresponding payments, and the timing of payments for payroll, rent and income taxes. 35 Table of Contents Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities increased $181.9 million to $796.6 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Gross capital expenditures increased $215.1 million primarily driven by investments in new and future DICK S House of Sport stores and DICK S Field House stores, as well as the construction of our sixth distribution facility and higher investments in remodels or other store enhancements. Cash used in investing activities in 2023 also included our acquisition of Moosejaw and progress payments for the purchase of corporate aircraft, offset by proceeds received from the sale of our Field & Stream trademark and other intellectual property. Financing Activities Financing activities have historically consisted of capital return initiatives, including share repurchases and cash dividend payments, cash flows generated from stock option exercises and cash activity associated with our Credit Facility, or other financing sources. Cash used in financing activities decreased $409.6 million during 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by lower share repurchases and lower cash payments for minimum tax withholding requirements as a result of the vesting of employee equity awards compared to the prior year, partially offset by changes in bank overdraft balances between periods and payments for dividends. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments We are party to contractual obligations that involve commitments to make payments to third parties in the ordinary course of business. Our future contractual obligations primarily consist of payments for operating leases, long-term debt and related interest payments, and other purchase obligations. Refer to Part IV. Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, Note 7 Leases and Note 9 Senior Notes for amounts outstanding as of February 1, 2025 related to operating leases and long-term debt. Other purchase obligations are for marketing commitments to promote our brand and products, including media and naming rights, technology-related commitments, licenses for trademarks and other ordinary course commitments. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into many contractual commitments, including purchase orders and commitments for products or services, but generally, such commitments represent annual or cancellable commitments. The amount of non-cancellable purchase commitments as of February 1, 2025 were approximately $180 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates Our significant accounting policies are described in Part IV. Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are both (1) most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and (2) require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of such policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Inventory Obsolescence We value inventory using the lower of weighted average cost and net realizable value, which is generally based on the selling price expectations of the merchandise. We regularly review inventories to determine if the carrying value of the inventory exceeds net realizable value and, when determined necessary, record a reserve to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value. Our reserve requires management to make assumptions and apply judgement related to current and anticipated demand and the promotional environment, which may be impacted by changes in customer merchandise preference, current and anticipated demand, consumer spending, weather patterns, economic conditions, business trends or merchandising strategies that could cause our inventory to be exposed to obsolescence or slow-moving merchandise. A 10% change in our obsolete inventory reserves as of February 1, 2025, would have affected income before income taxes by approximately $8.1 million in fiscal 2024. 36 Table of Contents Inventory Shrink Shrink expense is accrued as a percentage of merchandise sales based on historical shrink trends. We perform physical inventories at our stores and distribution centers throughout the year. The shrink reserve represents the cumulative loss estimate for each of our locations since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date. Estimates by location and in the aggregate are impacted by internal and external factors and may vary significantly from actual results. A 10% change in our shrink reserves as of February 1, 2025, would have affected income before income taxes by approximately $2.9 million in fiscal 2024. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill, indefinite-lived and other finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or whenever circumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred. Our evaluation for impairment requires accounting judgments and financial estimates in determining the fair value of the reporting unit or asset. If these judgments or estimates change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets. Our goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and a market approach. The income approach involves estimates related to our projected future growth, profitability and discount rates on expected future cash flows, while the market approach considers observed market data. Estimates may differ from actual results due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to our business models, or changes in operating performance. Significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially affect our future financial results. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. As of February 1, 2025, we had no reporting units at risk of impairment and a 10% change in the fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential impairment of goodwill. The fair value of our reporting units has remained substantially in excess of their carrying value over the last three fiscal years. Similar to our test for impairment of goodwill, the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves comparing their estimated fair values to their carrying values. We estimate the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are comprised primarily of trademarks and trade names, based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method, which assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third-party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to derive a benefit from these types of assets. This approach is dependent on a number of factors, including estimates of future sales projections and growth, royalty rates in the category of intellectual property, discount rates and other variables. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating fair value, we may be exposed to material losses. We recognize an impairment charge when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value. Refer to Part IV Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, Note 11 Fair Value Measurements for further information. We recorded no significant impairments in fiscal 2024, 2023 or 2022. As of February 1, 2025, a 10% change in the fair value of our intangible assets balance would not indicate a potential impairment. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows. Assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which is typically the store level. We use an income approach to determine the fair value of individual store locations, which requires discounting projected future cash flows over each store remaining lease term. When determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual store location, we make assumptions about key store variables that incorporate local market conditions, including sales growth rates, gross margin and controllable expenses, such as store payroll. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the store location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. During 2023, we recorded non-cash impairment charges from our Business Optimization. During 2022, we recorded non-cash impairment charges for store asset disposals at twelve Field & Stream stores that we closed in the period for conversion into DICK S House of Sport stores or expanded DICK S Sporting Goods stores. Refer to Part IV. Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, Note 11 Fair Value Measurements for further information. There were no other significant long-lived asset impairment charges recognized during fiscal 2024, 2023 or 2022. 37 Table of Contents
