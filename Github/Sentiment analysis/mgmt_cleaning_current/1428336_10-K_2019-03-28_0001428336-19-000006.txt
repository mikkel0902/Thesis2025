Item 7. Management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those discussed in the section titled Risk factors included under Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this report. See Special note regarding forward-looking statements. Overview We are a leader and an innovator in the high-growth category of technology-enabled services platforms that empower consumers to make healthcare saving and spending decisions. Our platform provides an ecosystem where consumers can access their tax-advantaged healthcare savings, compare treatment options and pricing, evaluate and pay healthcare bills, receive personalized benefit and clinical information, earn wellness incentives, and make educated investment choices to grow their tax-advantaged healthcare savings. The core of our ecosystem is the HSA, a financial account through which consumers spend and save long-term for healthcare on a tax-advantaged basis. We are the integrated HSA platform for 141 Health Plan and Administrator Partners and over 45,000 employer clients. Our Health Plan and Administrator Partners and Employer Partners constitute our Network Partners. Since our inception in 2002, we have been committed to developing technology solutions that empower healthcare consumers. We have a proprietary cloud-based technology platform, developed and refined during more than a decade of operations, which we believe is highly differentiated in the marketplace. Key platform differentiators include purpose-built technology that offers greater functionality and flexibility than the technologies used by our competitors, more than 3,000 data integrations with our Network Partner and other benefits provider systems, and configurability solutions with more than 1,700 uniquely tailored configurations serving our Network Partners. We work closely with our Network Partners to educate and provide personalized guidance regarding the benefits of HSAs and our other products. We earn revenue primarily from three sources: service revenue, custodial revenue and interchange revenue. We earn service revenue by providing monthly account services on our platform, primarily through contracts with our Network Partners, and custodial agreements with individual members. We earn custodial revenue from custodial cash assets deposited with our federally-insured custodial depository partners and with our insurance company partner, and recordkeeping fees we earn in respect of mutual funds in which our members invest. We also earn interchange revenue from interchange fees that we earn on payments that our members make using our physical and virtual payment cards. Key factors affecting our performance We believe that our performance and future success are driven by a number of factors, including those identified below. Each of these factors presents both significant opportunities and significant risks to our future performance. See the section entitled Risk factors included in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Structural change in U.S. private health insurance Substantially all of our revenue is derived from healthcare-related saving and spending by consumers in the United States, which is impacted by changes affecting the broader healthcare industry in the U.S. The healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years, and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur that will result in increased participation in HDHPs and other consumer-centric health plans. In particular, we believe that continued growth in healthcare costs, and related factors will spur HDHP and HSA growth; however, the timing and impact of these and other developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict, and changes in U.S. healthcare policy could adversely affect our business. Attracting and penetrating network partners We created our business model to take advantage of the changing dynamics of the U.S. private health insurance market. Our model is based on a B2B2C distribution strategy, meaning that we rely on our Employer Partners and Health Plan and Administrator Partners to reach potential members to increase the number of our HSA Members. Our success depends in large part on our ability to further penetrate our existing Network Partners by adding new HSA Members from these partners and adding new Network Partners. - 29 - Table of Contents Our innovative technology platform We believe that innovations incorporated in our technology that enable consumers to make healthcare saving and spending decisions differentiate us from our competitors and drive our growth in revenue, HSA Members, Network Partners and custodial assets. Similarly, these innovations underpin our ability to provide a differentiated consumer experience in a cost-effective manner. For example, we are currently undertaking a significant update of our proprietary platform architecture, which will allow us to improve our transaction processing capabilities and related platform infrastructure to support continued account and transaction growth. We intend to continue to invest in our technology development to enhance our platform capabilities and infrastructure. Our DEEP Purple culture The new healthcare consumer needs education and guidance delivered by people as well as technology. We believe that our "DEEP Purple" culture which we define as driving excellence, ethics, and process while providing remarkable service, is a significant factor in our ability to attract and retain customers and to address nimbly opportunities in the rapidly changing healthcare sector. We make significant efforts to promote and foster DEEP Purple within our workforce. We invest in and intend to continue to invest in human capital through technology-enabled training, career development and advancement opportunities. Interest rates As a non-bank custodian, we contract with federally-insured custodial depository partners and an insurance company partner to hold custodial cash assets on behalf of our members, and we earn a significant portion of our total revenue from interest rates offered to us by these partners. The contract terms range from three to five years and have either fixed or variable interest rates. As our custodial assets increase and existing agreements expire, we seek to enter into new contracts with federally-insured custodial depository partners, the terms of which are impacted by the then-prevailing interest rate environment. The diversification of deposits among partners and varied contract terms substantially reduces our exposure to short-term fluctuations in prevailing interest rates and mitigates the short-term impact of a sustained increase or decline in prevailing interest rates on our custodial revenue. A sustained decline in prevailing interest rates may negatively affect our business by reducing the size of the interest rate yield, or yield, available to us and thus the amount of the custodial revenue we can realize. Conversely, a sustained increase in prevailing interest rates without a corresponding increase in what we pay on our members' deposits can increase our yield over time. An increase in our yield would increase our custodial revenue as a percentage of total revenue. In addition, as our yield increases, we expect the spread to grow between the interest offered to us by our custodial depository partners and the interest retained by our members, thus increasing our profitability. However, we may be required to increase the interest retained by our members in a rising prevailing interest rate environment. Changes in prevailing interest rates are driven by macroeconomic trends and government policies over which we have no control. Our competition and industry Our direct competitors are HSA custodians. Many of these are state or federally chartered banks and other financial institutions for which we believe technology-based healthcare services are not a core business. Certain of our direct competitors have chosen to exit the market despite increased demand for these services. This has created, and we believe will continue to create, opportunities for us to leverage our technology platform and capabilities to increase our market share. However, some of our direct competitors (including well-known mutual fund companies such as Fidelity) are in a position, should they choose, to devote more resources to the development, sale and support of their products and services than we have at our disposal. In addition, numerous indirect competitors, including benefits administration technology and service providers, partner with banks and other HSA custodians to compete with us. Our Health Plan and Administrator Partners may also choose to offer technology-based healthcare services directly, as some health plans have done. Our success depends on our ability to predict and react quickly to these and other industry and competitive dynamics. Regulatory environment Federal law and regulations, including the Affordable Care Act, the Internal Revenue Code and IRS regulations, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and Department of Labor regulations, and public health regulations that govern the provision of health insurance, play a pivotal role in determining our market opportunity. Privacy and data security-related laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, laws governing the provision of investment advice to consumers, such as the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or the Advisers Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, anti-money laundry laws, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, all play a similar role in determining our competitive landscape. In addition, state-level regulations also have significant implications for our business in some cases. For example, our subsidiary HealthEquity Trust - 30 - Table of Contents Company is regulated by the Wyoming Division of Banking, and several states are considering, or have already passed, new fiduciary rules that can affect our business. Our ability to predict and react quickly to relevant legal and regulatory trends and to correctly interpret their market and competitive implications is important to our success. Our acquisition strategy We have a successful history of acquiring complementary assets and businesses that strengthen our platform. We seek to continue this growth strategy and are regularly engaged in evaluating different opportunities. We have developed an internal capability to source, evaluate and integrate acquisitions that have created value for shareholders. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary assets and businesses that we believe will strengthen our platform. Key financial and operating metrics Our management regularly reviews a number of key operating and financial metrics to evaluate our business, determine the allocation of our resources, make decisions regarding corporate strategies and evaluate forward-looking projections and trends affecting our business. We discuss certain of these key financial metrics, including revenue, below in the section entitled Key components of our results of operations. In addition, we utilize other key metrics as described below. HSA Members The following table sets forth our HSA Members as of and for the periods indicated: % change from % change from (in thousands, except percentages) January 31, 2019 January 31, 2018 January 31, 2017 2018 to 2019 2017 to 2018 HSA Members 3,994 3,403 2,746 17 % 24 % Average HSA Members - Year-to-date 3,608 2,952 2,339 22 % 26 % Average HSA Members - Quarter-to-date 3,813 3,189 2,519 20 % 27 % New HSA Members - Year-to-date 679 723 703 (6 )% 3 % New HSA Members - Quarter-to-date 341 404 422 (16 )% (4 )% Active HSA Members 3,241 2,863 2,378 13 % 20 % HSA Members with investments 163 122 66 34 % 85 % The number of our HSA Members is a key metric because our revenue is driven by the amount we earn from our HSA Members' accounts, balances and spend. The number of our HSA Members increased by approximately 592,000 , or 17% , from January 31, 2018 to January 31, 2019 , and by approximately 657,000 , or 24% , from January 31, 2017 to January 31, 2018 . The increase in the number of our HSA Members in these periods was primarily driven by further penetration into existing Network Partners and the addition of new Network Partners. Additionally, during the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , we acquired the rights to be custodian of HSA portfolios consisting of approximately 5,000 , 54,000 , and 35,000 HSA members, respectively. HSAs are individually owned portable healthcare accounts. As HSA Members transition between employers or health plans, they may no longer be enrolled in an HDHP that qualifies them to continue to make contributions to their HSA. If these HSA Members deplete their custodial balance, we may consider them no longer an Active HSA Member. We define an Active HSA Member as an HSA Member that (i) is associated with a Health Plan and Administrator Partner or an Employer Partner, in each case as of the end of the applicable period; or (ii) has held a custodial balance at any point during the previous twelve month period. The number of our Active HSA Members increased by approximately 378,000 , or 13% , from January 31, 2018 to January 31, 2019 , and by approximately 485,000 , or 20% , from January 31, 2017 to January 31, 2018 . Custodial assets The following table sets forth our custodial assets for the periods indicated: % change from % change from (in millions, except percentages) January 31, 2019 January 31, 2018 January 31, 2017 2018 to 2019 2017 to 2018 Custodial cash $ 6,428 $ 5,489 $ 4,380 17 % 25 % Custodial investments 1,670 1,289 659 30 % 96 % Total custodial assets $ 8,098 $ 6,778 $ 5,039 19 % 35 % Average daily custodial cash - Year-to-date $ 5,586 $ 4,571 $ 3,661 22 % 25 % Average daily custodial cash - Quarter-to-date $ 5,837 $ 4,876 $ 3,855 20 % 27 % - 31 - Table of Contents Our custodial assets, which are our HSA Members' assets for which we are the custodian, consist of the following components: (i) custodial cash deposits, which are deposits with our federally-insured custodial depository partners, (ii) custodial cash deposits invested in an annuity contract with our insurance company partner, and (iii) investments in mutual funds through our custodial investment fund partner. Measuring our custodial assets is important because our custodial revenue is directly affected by average daily custodial balances. Our total custodial assets increased by $1.3 billion , or 19% , from January 31, 2018 to January 31, 2019 . Our total custodial assets increased by $1.7 billion , or 35% , from January 31, 2017 to January 31, 2018 . The increase in total custodial assets in these periods was driven by additional custodial assets from our existing HSA Members and new custodial assets from new HSA Members added during the fiscal year. Importantly, our custodial investment assets increased by $ 381.2 million , or 30% , from January 31, 2018 to January 31, 2019 , and by $630.1 million , or 96% , from January 31, 2017 to January 31, 2018 , reflecting our strategy to help our HSA Members build wealth and invest for retirement. During the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , we acquired the rights to be custodian of HSA portfolios consisting of approximately $12.0 million, $164.0 million, and $63.0 million of custodial assets, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial metric, as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and certain other non-operating items. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and analysts in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and our board of directors because it reflects operating profitability before consideration of non-operating expenses and non-cash expenses, and serves as a basis for comparison against other companies in our industry. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated: Year ended January 31, (in thousands) 2019 2018 2017 Net income $ 73,899 $ 47,362 $ 26,376 Interest income (1,946 ) (734 ) (531 ) Interest expense 270 274 275 Income tax provision 1,919 4,827 13,744 Depreciation and amortization 12,256 11,089 8,889 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 5,929 4,863 4,297 Stock-based compensation expense 21,057 14,310 8,398 Other (1) 4,998 2,689 1,348 Adjusted EBITDA $ 118,382 $ 84,680 $ 62,796 (1) For the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , Other consisted of non-income based taxes of $487, $439 and $358, acquisition-related costs of $2,121, $2,197 and $631, amortization of incremental costs to obtain a contract of $1,470, $0 and $0, loss on disposal of previously capitalized software development of $676, $0 and $0, and other costs of $244, $53 and $359, respectively. The following table sets forth our Adjusted EBITDA: Year ended January 31, % change from % change from (in thousands, except percentages) 2019 2018 2017 2018 to 2019 2017 to 2018 Adjusted EBITDA $ 118,382 $ 84,680 $ 62,796 40 % 35 % As a percentage of revenue 41 % 37 % 35 % Our Adjusted EBITDA increased by $33.7 million , or 40% , from $84.7 million for the year ended January 31, 2018 to $118.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2019 . The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by the overall growth of our business, including a $23.3 million , or 43% , increase in income from operations. Our Adjusted EBITDA increased by $21.9 million , or 35% , from $62.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2017 to $84.7 million for the year ended January 31, 2018 . The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by the overall growth of our business, including a $13.2 million , or 32% , increase in income from operations. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. - 32 - Table of Contents Key components of our results of operations Revenue The following table sets forth our revenue for the periods indicated: Year ended January 31, % change from % change from (in thousands, except percentages) 2019 2018 2017 2018 to 2019 2017 to 2018 Service revenue $ 100,564 $ 91,619 $ 77,254 10 % 19 % Custodial revenue 126,178 87,160 59,593 45 % 46 % Interchange revenue 60,501 50,746 41,523 19 % 22 % Total revenue $ 287,243 $ 229,525 $ 178,370 25 % 29 % We earn revenue from three primary sources: service revenue, custodial revenue and interchange revenue. Service revenue. We earn service revenue from the fees we charge our Network Partners, employer clients and individual members for the administration services we provide in connection with the HSAs and RAs we offer. With respect to our Network Partners, our fees are generally based on a fixed tiered structure for the duration of our agreement with the relevant Network Partner and are paid to us on a monthly basis. We recognize revenue on a monthly basis as services are rendered under our written service agreements. Custodial revenue. We earn custodial revenue, an increasing component of our overall revenue, from our custodial cash assets deposited with our federally-insured custodial depository partners and with our insurance company partner, and recordkeeping fees we earn in respect of mutual funds in which our members invest. As a non-bank custodian, we deposit our custodial cash with our various depository partners pursuant to contracts that (i) have terms up to five years, (ii) provide for a fixed or variable interest rate payable on the average daily cash balances deposited with the relevant depository partner, and (iii) have minimum and maximum required deposit balances. We earn custodial revenue on our custodial cash that is based on the interest rates offered to us by these depository partners. In addition, once a member HSA cash balance reaches a certain threshold, the member is able to invest his or her HSA assets in mutual funds through our custodial investment partner. We earn a recordkeeping fee, calculated as a percentage of invested assets, in respect of custodial investments. Interchange revenue. We earn interchange revenue each time one of our members uses one of our payment cards to make a qualified purchase. This revenue is collected each time a member swipes our payment card to pay a healthcare-related expense. We recognize interchange revenue monthly based on reports received from third parties, namely, the card-issuing bank and the card processor. Cost of revenue Cost of revenue includes costs related to servicing member accounts, managing customer and partner relationships and processing reimbursement claims. Expenditures include personnel-related costs, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, common expense allocations (such as office rent, supplies, and other overhead expenses), new member and participant supplies, and other operating costs related to servicing our members. Other components of cost of revenue include interest retained by members on custodial cash and interchange costs incurred in connection with processing card transactions for our members. Service costs. Service costs include the servicing costs described above. Additionally, for new accounts, we incur on-boarding costs associated with the new accounts, such as new member welcome kits, the cost associated with issuance of new payment cards and costs of marketing materials that we produce for our Network Partners. Custodial costs. Custodial costs are comprised of interest retained by our HSA Members and fees we pay to banking consultants whom we use to help secure agreements with our federally-insured custodial depository partners. Interest retained by HSA Members is calculated on a tiered basis. The interest rates retained by HSA Members can change based on a formula or upon required notice. Interchange costs. Interchange costs are comprised of costs we incur in connection with processing payment transactions initiated by our members. Due to the substantiation requirement on RA-linked payment card transactions, which is the requirement that we confirm each purchase involves a qualified medical expense as defined under applicable law, payment card costs are higher for RA card transactions. In addition to fixed per card fees, we are assessed additional transaction costs determined by the amount of the transaction. - 33 - Table of Contents Gross profit and gross margin Our gross profit is our total revenue minus our total cost of revenue, and our gross margin is our gross profit expressed as a percentage of our total revenue. Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a number of factors, including the amount we charge our partners and members, interest rates, how many services we deliver per account, and payment processing costs per account. We expect our annual gross margin to increase somewhat over the near term as our custodial revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue, although our gross margin could fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these factors. Operating expenses Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, including sales commissions for our direct sales force, external agent/broker commission expenses, marketing expenses, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and common expense allocations. Technology and development. Technology and development expenses include personnel and related expenses for software engineering, information technology, security and product development. Technology and development expenses also include software engineering services, the costs of operating our on-demand technology infrastructure, depreciation, amortization of capitalized software development costs, stock-based compensation, and common expense allocations. General and administrative. General and administrative expenses include personnel and related expenses of, and professional fees incurred by our executive, finance, legal, compliance, corporate development, and people departments. They also include depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and common expense allocations. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets results primarily from our acquisition of intangible member assets. We acquired these intangible member assets from third-party custodians. We amortize these assets over the assets estimated useful life of 15 years. We also acquired other intangible assets, which are 401(k) customer relationships, in connection with an acquisition of a business. We amortize these assets over the assets' estimated useful life of 10 years. We evaluate our acquired intangible assets for impairment at least each year, or at a triggering event. Other expense, net Other expense primarily consists of interest expense associated with our credit agreement, non-income-based taxes and acquisition-related expenses, offset by interest income on corporate cash and marketable securities. Income tax provision We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States based on a calendar tax year which differs from our fiscal year-end for financial reporting purposes. We use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes, under which current tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on the tax returns for the current fiscal year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, net operating loss carryforwards, and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. As of January 31, 2019 , we have recorded a net non-current deferred tax liability in most jurisdictions except Utah and four other states for which a net non-current deferred tax asset has been recorded. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Due to the positive evidence of current taxable income coupled with forecasted profitability, no valuation allowance was required as of January 31, 2019 for most of our deferred tax assets. However, we have recorded a valuation allowance of $0.1 million as of January 31, 2019 with respect to realized capital losses for which we do not expect to generate capital gains in order to utilize the capital losses in the future. This valuation allowance was reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-01. No valuation allowance was recorded as of January 31, 2018. - 34 - Table of Contents Results of operations Service revenue The $8.9 million , or 10% , increase in service revenue from the year ended January 31, 2018 to the year ended January 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the number of our HSA Members, partially offset by the lower service revenue per HSA Member described below. The $14.4 million , or 19% , increase in service revenue from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 was also primarily due to an increase in the number of our HSA Members, partially offset by the lower service revenue per HSA Member described below. The number of our HSA Members increased by approximately 592,000 , or 17% , from January 31, 2018 to January 31, 2019 , and by approximately 657,000 , or 24% , from January 31, 2017 to January 31, 2018 . Service revenue as a percentage of our total revenue continues to decrease primarily due to the higher growth rate of custodial revenue. Service revenue per HSA Member decreased by approximately 10% from the year ended January 31, 2018 to the year ended January 31, 2019 , and 6% from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 . Our service fee tier structure incentivizes our Network Partners to add HSA Members by charging a lower rate for more HSA Members. As Network Partners add more HSA Members, the account fee per HSA Member will continue to decrease. Custodial revenue The $39.0 million , or 45% , increase in custodial revenue from the year ended January 31, 2018 to the year ended January 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in average daily custodial cash of $1.0 billion , or 22% , and an increase in the yield on average custodial cash from 1.83% in the year ended January 31, 2018 to 2.15% in the year ended January 31, 2019 . The $27.6 million , or 46% , increase in custodial revenue from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in average daily custodial cash of $0.9 billion , or 25% , as well as an increase in the yield on average custodial cash from 1.58% in the year ended January 31, 2017 to 1.83% in the year ended January 31, 2018 . Custodial revenue as a percentage of our total revenue continues to increase primarily due to our entry into new custodial depository agreements with higher interest rates payable on average cash balances deposited thereunder, and also due to average daily custodial cash assets growing at a faster rate than the number of HSA Members. Custodial revenue per HSA Member increased by approximately 18% from the year ended January 31, 2018 to the year ended January 31, 2019 . Custodial revenue per HSA Member increased by approximately 16% from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 , primarily due to the higher yield and higher average custodial cash balances. Interchange revenue The $9.8 million , or 19% , increase in interchange revenue from the year ended January 31, 2018 to the year ended January 31, 2019 was due to an overall increase in the number of our HSA Members and payment activity, partially offset by the lower interchange revenue per HSA Member described below. The $9.2 million , or 22% , increase in interchange revenue from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 was due to an overall increase in the number of our HSA Members and payment activity. Interchange revenue per HSA Member decreased by approximately 2% from the year ended January 31, 2018 to the year ended January 31, 2019 , and by approximately 3% from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 , primarily due to a decrease in payment activity per HSA Member. Total revenue Total revenue per HSA Member increased by 2% from the year ended January 31, 2018 to the year ended January 31, 2019 , due to the increase in custodial revenue per HSA Member, partially offset by the decreases in service revenue and interchange revenue per HSA Member. Total revenue per HSA Member increased by 2% from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 , due to the increase in custodial revenue per HSA Member, partially offset by the decreases in service revenue and interchange revenue per HSA Member. - 35 - Table of Contents Cost of revenue The following table sets forth our cost of revenue for the periods indicated: (in thousands, except percentages) Year ended January 31, % change from % change from 2019 2018 2017 2018 to 2019 2017 to 2018 Service costs $ 76,858 $ 70,426 $ 51,868 9 % 36 % Custodial costs 14,124 11,400 9,767 24 % 17 % Interchange costs 15,068 12,783 10,380 18 % 23 % Total cost $ 106,050 $ 94,609 $ 72,015 12 % 31 % Service costs The $6.4 million , or 9% , increase in service costs from the year ended January 31, 2018 to the year ended January 31, 2019 was due to the higher volume of total accounts being serviced . The $6.4 million increase includes $4.2 million related to the hiring of additional personnel to implement and support our new Network Partners and HSA Members, increased information technology expenses of $1.3 million, and general overhead allocation of $1.1 million, partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in other expenses. The $18.6 million , or 36% , increase in service costs from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 was due to the higher volume of total accounts being serviced . The $18.6 million increase includes $11.0 million related to the hiring of additional personnel to implement and support our new Network Partners and HSA Members, increased activation and processing costs of $4.4 million related to account and card activation, monthly processing of statements and other communications, as well as fraud prevention measures, stock compensation of $0.8 million, depreciation and amortization of $0.6 million, general overhead allocation of $0.7 million and $1.1 million in other expenses. Custodial costs The $2.7 million , or 24% , increase in custodial costs from the year ended January 31, 2018 to the year ended January 31, 2019 was due to an increase in average daily custodial cash from $4.6 billion for the year ended January 31, 2018 to $5.6 billion during the year ended January 31, 2019 , which was partially offset by a decrease in custodial costs on average custodial cash from 0.25% for the year ended January 31, 2018 to 0.24% for the year ended January 31, 2019 . The $1.6 million , or 17% , increase in custodial costs from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 was due to an increase in average daily custodial cash from $3.7 billion for the year ended January 31, 2017 to $4.6 billion during the year ended January 31, 2018 , which was partially offset by a decrease in custodial costs on average custodial cash from 0.27% for the year ended January 31, 2017 to 0.25% for the year ended January 31, 2018 . Interchange costs The $2.3 million , or 18% , increase in interchange costs from the year ended January 31, 2018 to the year ended January 31, 2019 , and the $2.4 million , or 23% , increase from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 , was a result of the overall increase in payment activity, which is attributable to the growth in HSA Members. Cost of revenue As we continue to add HSA Members, we expect that our cost of revenue will increase in dollar amount to support our Network Partners and members. Cost of revenue will continue to be affected by a number of different factors, including our ability to scale our Member Education Center, Network Partner implementation and account management functions. - 36 - Table of Contents Operating expenses The following table sets forth our operating expenses for the periods indicated: (in thousands, except percentages) Year ended January 31, % change from % change from 2019 2018 2017 2018 to 2019 2017 to 2018 Sales and marketing $ 29,498 $ 23,139 $ 18,320 27 % 26 % Technology and development 35,057 27,385 22,375 28 % 22 % General and administrative 33,039 25,111 20,151 32 % 25 % Amortization of acquired intangible assets 5,929 4,863 4,297 22 % 13 % Total operating expenses $ 103,523 $ 80,498 $ 65,143 29 % 24 % Sales and marketing The $6.4 million , or 27% , increase in sales and marketing expenses from the year ended January 31, 2018 to the year ended January 31, 2019 primarily consisted of increased staffing and sales commissions of $1.1 million, increased stock-based compensation expense of $1.5 million, increased partner commissions of $2.5 million, and an increase in other expenses of $1.3 million. The $4.8 million , or 26% , increase in sales and marketing expenses from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 primarily consisted of increased staffing and sales commissions of $2.7 million, increased stock-based compensation expense of $1.1 million, increased partner commissions of $0.3 million, and an increase in other expenses of $0.7 million. Sales and marketing expense from the year ended January 31, 2018 to the year ended January 31, 2019 reflects the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606. As a result, we capitalize sales commissions and amortize these costs over the average economic life of an HSA Member and RA customer relationship, to sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Our previous practice was to fully expense sales commissions when the HSA and RA account was added to our platform. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to increase the size of our sales and marketing organization and expand into new markets. On an annual basis, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as a percentage of our total revenue over the near term. However, our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period due to the seasonality of our total revenue and the timing and extent of our sales and marketing expenses. Technology and development The $7.7 million , or 28% , increase in technology and development expenses from the year ended January 31, 2018 to the year ended January 31, 2019 resulted primarily from the hiring of additional personnel of $4.7 million, increased amortization and depreciation of $1.3 million, stock compensation of $1.8 million, and other expenses of $1.3 million, which were partially offset by a decrease in professional services of $0.2 million and an increase in capitalized engineering costs of $1.2 million associated with the development and enhancement of our proprietary technology platform. The $5.0 million , or 22% , increase in technology and development expenses for the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 resulted primarily from the hiring of additional personnel of $4.4 million, increased amortization and depreciation of $1.6 million, and stock compensation of $1.4 million, which were partially offset by a decrease in professional services of $2.0 million and an increase in capitalized engineering costs of $0.4 million associated with the development and enhancement of our proprietary technology platform. We expect our technology and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in the development and security of our proprietary system. On an annual basis, we expect our technology and development expenses to increase as a percentage of our total revenue. Our technology and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period due to the seasonality of our total revenue and the timing and extent of our technology and development expenses. General and administrative The $7.9 million , or 32% , increase in general and administrative expenses from the year ended January 31, 2018 to the year ended January 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional personnel of $3.4 million, increased stock compensation of $3.2 million, increased professional fees of $0.7 million and increased other expenses of $0.6 million. - 37 - Table of Contents The $5.0 million , or 25% , increase in general and administrative expenses from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional personnel of $3.3 million, increased stock compensation of $2.6 million and increased other expenses of $1.1 million, which were partially offset by a decrease in professional services of $2.0 million. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future due to the additional demands on our legal, compliance, accounting, and insurance functions that we incur as we continue to grow our business, as well as other costs associated with being a public company. On an annual basis, we expect our general and administrative expenses to remain steady as a percentage of our total revenue. Our general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period due to the seasonality of our total revenue and the timing and extent of our general and administrative expenses. Amortization of acquired intangible assets The $1.1 million and $0.6 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets for the years ended January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, was attributable to HSA portfolio asset acquisitions and the acquisition of a business. On an annual basis, we expect total amortization of acquired intangible assets to remain steady. Income tax provision Income tax provision for the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 was $1.9 million , $4.8 million , and $13.7 million , respectively. The decrease in income tax provision during the year ended January 31, 2019 compared to the year ended January 31, 2018 was primarily the result of the reduction in the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of legislative changes effective January 1, 2018 and an increase in federal and state research and development tax credits over prior periods. The decrease in income tax provision during the year ended January 31, 2018 compared to the year ended January 31, 2017 was primarily the result of a $14.1 million decrease related to excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation expense recognized in the provision for income taxes, pursuant to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting as well as an increase in federal and state income taxes driven by an increase in income before income taxes. Our effective income tax rate for the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was 2.5% , 9.2% , and 34.3% , respectively. The difference between the effective income tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate each period is impacted by a number of factors, including the relative mix of earnings among state jurisdictions, credits, excess tax benefits or shortfalls on stock-based compensation expense due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, and other discrete items. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended January 31, 2019 over the year ended January 31, 2018 was primarily due to the reduction in the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of legislative changes effective January 1, 2018 and an increase in federal and state research and development tax credits over prior periods. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended January 31, 2018 compared to the year ended January 31, 2017 was primarily the result of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation expense. Seasonality Seasonal concentration of our growth combined with our recurring revenue model create seasonal variation in our results of operations. A significant number of new and existing Network Partners bring us new HSA Members beginning in January of each year concurrent with the start of many employers benefit plan years. Before we realize any revenue from these new HSA Members, we incur costs related to implementing and supporting our new Network Partners and new HSA Members. These costs of services relate to activating accounts and hiring additional staff, including seasonal help to support our member support center. These expenses begin to ramp up during our third fiscal quarter with the majority of expenses incurred in our fourth fiscal quarter. In the past, we have experienced higher operating expenses in our fourth fiscal quarter due to sales commissions for new accounts activated in January. Beginning February 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606") . As a result of this adoption, the Company capitalizes incremental contract acquisition costs, such as sales commissions, and amortizes these costs over the average economic life of a member. - 38 - Table of Contents Liquidity and capital resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities overview As of January 31, 2019 , our principal source of liquidity was our current cash and cash equivalent balances, collections from our service, custodial and interchange revenue activities, and availability under our credit facility. We rely on cash provided by operating activities to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, which primarily relate to the payment of corporate payroll and other operating costs, and capital expenditures. As of January 31, 2019 cash, cash equivalents were $361.5 million . As of January 31, 2018 cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $240.3 million . Capital resources We have a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC. This shelf registration statement, which includes a base prospectus, allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings. Unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus, we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, working capital, sales and marketing activities, general and administrative matters and capital expenditures, and if opportunities arise, for the acquisition of, or investment in, assets, technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our business. Pending such uses, we may invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing securities. In addition, we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time. We have a secured credit facility of $100.0 million. The credit facility has a term of five years and expires on September 30, 2020. The credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type. There were no borrowings under the facility as of January 31, 2019 . We were in compliance with all covenants as of January 31, 2019 . Use of cash Capital expenditures for the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 were $13.8 million , $15.8 million , and $12.7 million , respectively. We expect to continue our increased capital expenditures during the year ending January 31, 2020 as we continue to devote a significant amount of our capital expenditures to improving the architecture and functionality of our proprietary system. Costs to improve the architecture of our proprietary system include computer hardware, personnel and related costs for software engineering and outsourced software engineering services. In addition, we plan to devote further resources to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for our office space. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. To the extent these current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required, we may not be able to raise it on favorable terms, if at all. The following table shows our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the stated periods: Year ended January 31, (in thousands) 2019 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 113,422 $ 81,702 $ 45,591 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 25,652 (36,748 ) (13,054 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 22,929 14,564 23,776 Increase in cash and cash equivalents 162,003 59,518 56,313 Beginning cash and cash equivalents 199,472 139,954 83,641 Ending cash and cash equivalents $ 361,475 $ 199,472 $ 139,954 - 39 - Table of Contents Cash flows provided by operating activities.

These were offset by changes in deferred income taxes of $2.9 million, accounts receivable of $2.7 million and other assets of $1.3 million. Cash flows provided by and used in investing activities. Net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended January 31, 2019 was primarily the result of the proceeds from the sale of marketable securities. We also continued our purchases of software and capitalized software development costs due to continued growth. During the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , purchases of software and capitalized software development costs were $10.0 million , $10.4 million , and $9.0 million , respectively. We also increased our purchases of property and equipment to $3.9 million , $5.5 million and $3.6 million , respectively, due to our continued growth. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended January 31, 2018 was primarily the result of the acquisition of the right to be the custodian of the First Interstate Bancsystem and Alliant Credit Union HSA portfolio acquisitions for $6.4 million and $8.0 million , respectively, as well as our acquisition of the rights to be the sole administrator of a portfolio of HSA Members for $3.3 million and an acquisition of a business for $2.9 million .

Cash flow provided by financing activities during the year ended January 31, 2017 resulted primarily from proceeds associated with the exercise of stock options of $7.1 million, and the associated tax benefits of $16.6 million. Contractual obligations We lease office space, data storage facilities and equipment, as well as contractual commitments related to network infrastructure and certain maintenance requirements under long-term non-cancelable operating leases. Future minimum lease payments and other contractual payments required under non-cancelable obligations as of January 31, 2019 are as follows: Payment due by period (in thousands) Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Total Office lease obligations $ 3,690 $ 9,522 $ 11,600 $ 44,252 $ 69,064 Data storage and equipment lease obligations 454 361 47 862 Processing services agreement 825 825 1,650 Telephony services 357 357 Other 1,932 3,945 34 5,911 Total $ 7,258 $ 14,653 $ 11,681 $ 44,252 $ 77,844 - 40 - Table of Contents Office lease obligations. The Company headquarters is in Draper, UT where it leases two buildings and is party to a third lease for a building to be constructed on a parcel contiguous to its existing buildings. The leases will expire on November 30, 2030. The Company is responsible for payment of taxes and operating expenses relating to the premises occupied by the Company, in addition to 2.5% annual rent increases over the lease term. The Company also leases office space in Overland Park, Kansas, under a lease that expires in March 2022. The Company plans to continue to lease additional office space to support its growth, as necessary. In addition, many of the Company's existing lease agreements provide it with the option to renew. Data storage and equipment lease obligations. The data storage and equipment leases relate to the Company's offsite data storage facilities and office equipment leases, which expire during the years ended January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2024 , respectively. Telephony services. The telephony service agreement relates to our 24/7/365 member support center. The agreement expires in September 2019. In January 2019, the Company entered into a telephony agreement with a new provider that is cancelable without significant penalty. Processing services agreement. The Company's processing services agreement with a vendor expires December 31, 2020 and requires the Company to pay a minimum processing fee based on the processing year of the agreement. The Company may terminate the agreement beginning January 1, 2020 by providing 180 days written notice. If the processing agreement is terminated prior to December 31, 2020, the Company is required to pay the vendor a termination fee, equal to 75% of the aggregate value of the minimum processing fees for the remaining years of the agreement, plus a portion of the account-boarding incentive fee. For each of the years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the Company exceeded the minimum amounts required under the agreement. The Company also has agreements with several entities for access to technology and software. The agreements are based on usage, and there are no minimum required monthly payments. Off-balance sheet arrangements Except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical accounting policies and significant management estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates, and in other instances, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management judgment in its application, while in other cases, management judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions. We believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our business and prospects for future performance, as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management judgment and estimates. These significant policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below. As a result of the Company's February 1, 2018 adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606") it has updated its discussions of critical accounting policies related to revenue recognition. See Note 1. to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements. Revenue recognition We earn revenue primarily from three sources: service revenue, custodial revenue and interchange revenue. We determine revenue recognition through the following five step approach under ASC 606: (1) identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) - 41 - Table of Contents determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Service revenue : We charge our Network Partners or individual members a monthly service fee once a member account is set up on our system. We recognize service revenue on a monthly basis as we satisfy our service performance obligations. In addition, we earn fees paid by employer partners and plan participants in connection with plan administrator and fiduciary services for 401(k) employer sponsors. The fees are paid on a quarterly basis and revenue is recognized in the month in which we satisfy our performance obligations. Custodial revenue: We earn interest on custodial cash. This interest is earned from various federally-insured depository partners and from an annuity contract with our insurance company partner with whom we deposit our members HSA cash assets. We also earn certain administrative and recordkeeping fees for custodial investments from our investment partners and customers. We recognize custodial revenue each month based on the amount received by its custodial partners and investment partners. Interchange revenue: We earn interchange revenue from card transaction swipes by our members when our members use our payment cards to pay healthcare-related claims and expenses. We recognize interchange revenue in the month the payment transaction occurs. Costs to obtain a contract We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, such as sales commissions, when we expect the benefit of those costs to be recoverable. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract with a customer are included in Other current and Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We apply the practical expedient to recognize incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period would have been one year or less. We applied a portfolio approach based on product or service type to determine the amortization period for the sales commissions contract costs. The capitalized costs will be amortized over a period consistent with the transfer to the customer of the products or services to which the asset relates. The estimated lives have been determined by taking into consideration the type of product or service sold, the estimated customer relationship period based on our historical experience, and industry data. Amortization of capitalized sales commission contract costs is included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. We review the assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the associated carrying amount may not be recoverable. Capitalized software development costs We account for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 350-40, Internal-Use Software . Costs incurred during operation and post-implementation stages are charged to expense. Costs incurred that are directly attributable to developing or obtaining software for internal use incurred in the application development stage are capitalized. Management judgment is required in determining the point when various projects enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized. Acquisitions To determine whether an acquisition qualifies as a business combination or an asset acquisition, we make certain judgments, which include assessment of whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset or group of similar assets, and whether the acquired group of assets includes an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. If we determine that substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is not concentrated in a single asset group or group of similar assets, and that the acquisition contains an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, the acquisition is determined to be a business combination. In instances where substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset or group of similar assets, the acquisition is determined to be an asset acquisition. Under the asset acquisition method of accounting, the Company is required to fair value the assets transferred. The cost of the assets acquired is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair values and does not give rise to goodwill. If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are capitalized and subsequently amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets. - 42 - Table of Contents Goodwill and intangible assets We apply ASC 805, Business Combinations , and ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other to account for goodwill and intangible assets. In accordance with these standards, we amortize all finite lived intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. We review finite lived intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the associated carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever a triggering event or change in circumstances occurs, at the reporting unit level. We are required to recognize an impairment charge if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Management uses all available information to make this fair value determination, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income, as well as our stock price and associated market capitalization. In addition, if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value (including the goodwill), further management judgment must be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities. A lower fair value estimate in the future, or a prolonged or significant decline in our stock price, could provide evidence of a need to record a material impairment of goodwill. Income taxes We account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method as set forth in the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, current tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on the tax returns for the current fiscal year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, for net operating losses, and for tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized in future years. We use the tax law ordering approach of intraperiod allocation in determining when excess tax benefits have been realized for provisions of the tax law that identify the sequence in which those amounts are utilized for tax purposes. We have also elected to exclude the indirect tax effects of share-based compensation deductions in computing the income tax provision recorded within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Also, we use the portfolio approach in releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit in the financial statements as the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained upon settlement. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Changes in facts and circumstances could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and results of operations. Stock-based compensation Stock options. We award time-based and performance-based stock options to certain team members, executive officers, and directors. Stock-based compensation costs related to stock options granted are measured at the date of grant based on the estimated fair value of the award. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. With respect to time-based stock options, the grant date fair value of stock-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, and is reversed as pre-vesting forfeitures occur, which is generally the vesting period of the award. With respect to performance-based stock options, stock compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period using the graded-vesting attribution method when it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. Each reporting period, we evaluate the probability of achieving the performance criteria and of the number of shares that are expected to vest; compensation expense is then adjusted to reflect the number of shares expected to vest. Accordingly, the expense recognized is an estimate that may change over time - 43 - Table of Contents as key assumptions are updated. We expect to continue to grant stock options in the future, and to the extent that we do, our stock-based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards. If we had made different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense, net income and net income per share of common stock could have been significantly different. These assumptions include: Expected volatility: In prior years, we did not have adequate length of trading history for our common stock. Therefore, the expected stock price volatility for our common stock was estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for industry peers based on daily price observations. We did not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers common stock because the volume of activity was relatively low. During the year ended January 31, 2019 , we determined that we had a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock price to began using our own historical volatility in addition to the volatility of publicly traded industry peer companies, as our share price history grows over time. Expected term: The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We use the "simplified" method to estimate the expected term as determined under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110 due to limited option exercise history as a public company. Risk-free interest rate: The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group. Expected dividend yield: We have never declared or paid any cash dividends to our common stockholders and do not presently plan to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, other than in connection with the special dividend described in Item 5- Market for registrant's common equity, related stockholders matters and issuer purchases of equity securities. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of options granted during the periods presented: Year ended January 31, 2019 2018 2017 Expected dividend yield % % % Expected stock price volatility 36.53% - 37.84% 37.79% - 38.01% 38.01% - 38.37% Risk-free interest rate 2.52% - 2.79% 1.18% - 2.07% 1.18% - 2.18% Expected life of options 5.17 - 6.25 years 4.50 - 6.25 years 4.50 - 6.25 years We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions utilized for our stock-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis. The estimated fair value of a stock option using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is impacted significantly by changes in a company stock price. For example, all other assumptions being equal, the estimated fair value of a stock option will increase as the closing price of a company stock increases, and vice versa. Restricted stock units and restricted stock awards. We award time-based and performance-based restricted stock units ("RSU"s and "PRSUs", respectively) and restricted stock awards ("RSAs" and "PRSAs", respectively) to certain team members, executive officers, and directors. Stock-based compensation costs related to these awards granted are measured at the date of grant based on the estimated fair value of the award. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the current value of the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant, less the present value of future expected dividends discounted at the risk-free interest rate. With respect to time-based RSUs and RSAs, the grant date fair value of stock-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, and is reversed as pre-vesting forfeitures occur, which is generally the vesting period of the award. With respect to PRSUs and PRSAs, stock compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period using the graded-vesting attribution method when it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. Each reporting period, we evaluate the probability of achieving the performance criteria and of the number of shares that are expected to vest; compensation expense is then adjusted to reflect the number of shares expected to vest. Accordingly, the expense recognized is an estimate that may change over time as key assumptions are updated. We expect to continue to grant RSUs and PRSUs in the future, and to the extent that we do, our stock-based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase. - 44 - Table of Contents Self insurance We are self-insured for medical and dental benefits for all qualifying employees. The medical plan carries a stop-loss policy which will protect from individual claims during the plan year exceeding $110,000 . We record estimates of costs of claims incurred but not reported based on an analysis of historical data and independent estimates. Recent accounting pronouncements See Note 1.
