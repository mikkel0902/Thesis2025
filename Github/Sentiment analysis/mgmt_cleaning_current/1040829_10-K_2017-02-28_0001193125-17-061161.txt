Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are a Delaware corporation, originally incorporated in 1956, that, following our REIT conversion, began operating as a self-advised and self-administered REIT for federal income tax purposes on January 1, 2013, specializing in group-oriented, destination hotel assets in urban and resort markets. Our owned assets include a network of four upscale, meetings-focused resorts totaling 7,811 rooms that are managed by Marriott International, Inc. ( Marriott ) under the Gaylord Hotels brand. These four resorts, which we refer to as our Gaylord Hotels properties, consist of the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee ( Gaylord Opryland ), the Gaylord Palms Resort & Convention Center near Orlando, Florida ( Gaylord Palms ), the Gaylord Texan Resort & Convention Center near Dallas, Texas ( Gaylord Texan ) and the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center near Washington D.C. ( Gaylord National ). Our other owned assets managed by Marriott include Gaylord Springs Golf Links ( Gaylord Springs ), the Wildhorse Saloon, the General Jackson Showboat ( General Jackson ), the Inn at Opryland, a 303-room overflow hotel adjacent to Gaylord Opryland, and the AC Hotel at National Harbor, Washington D.C. ( AC Hotel ), a 192-room overflow hotel adjacent to Gaylord National that opened in April 2015. We also own and operate media and entertainment assets including the Grand Ole Opry, the legendary weekly showcase of country music finest performers for over 90 years; the Ryman Auditorium, the storied live music venue and former home of the Grand Ole Opry located in downtown Nashville; and WSM-AM, the Opry radio home. Each of our award-winning Gaylord Hotels properties incorporates not only high quality lodging, but also at least 400,000 square feet of meeting, convention and exhibition space, superb food and beverage options and retail and spa facilities within a single self-contained property. As a result, our Gaylord Hotels properties provide a convenient and entertaining environment for convention guests. Our Gaylord Hotels properties focus on the large group meetings market in the United States. In 2012, we completed restructuring transactions to facilitate our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Our goal is to become the nation premier hospitality REIT for group-oriented, destination hotel assets in urban and resort markets. Marriott manages the day-to-day operations of our Gaylord Hotels properties, the Inn at Opryland, the AC Hotel, and certain of our Nashville attractions. As a result, we rely upon Marriott to generate occupancy and revenue levels at our hotel properties. Our concentration in the hospitality industry, and in particular the large group meetings sector of the hospitality industry, exposes us to certain risks outside of our control. Past recessionary conditions in the national economy, including U.S. government sequestration, have previously resulted in economic pressures on the hospitality industry generally, and on our properties. For much of 2016, we have experienced strong sales booking levels, as overall strength in the group sector and joint efforts with Marriott have resulted in record bookings. We continue to work with Marriott to pursue further improvements. See Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors under Part I of this annual report for important information regarding forward-looking statements made in this report and risks and uncertainties we face. 34 Table of Contents Gaylord Rockies Resort & Convention Center As further discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included herein, in March 2016, certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into a series of agreements with affiliates of RIDA Development Corporation ( RIDA ) and Ares Management, L.P. ( Ares ) with respect to an equity investment in the Gaylord Rockies Resort & Convention Center in Aurora, Colorado ( Gaylord Rockies ), which is currently being developed by RIDA and Ares. The hotel will be managed by Marriott pursuant to a long-term management contract and is expected to consist of a 1,500-room resort hotel with over 485,000 square feet of exhibition, meeting, pre-function and outdoor space. The hotel is expected to be completed in late 2018 and has a total estimated project cost of approximately $800 million. We acquired a 35% interest in the project for a capital contribution expected to total approximately $86.1 million. We have funded $70.1 million of our capital contribution and expect to fund the remainder of our capital contribution during the first quarter of 2017. Our remaining capital contributions will be funded from available cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The terms of our investment provide that we will have the ability to approve certain major decisions affecting the hotel, including, but not limited to, operating budgets, major capital expenditures, material transactions involving the hotel, and approval of designated hotel senior management. We also have a right of first offer to acquire the remainder of the project and designated rights to participate in any sales process with respect to the project after exercise of our first offer rights. A subsidiary of the Company will provide designated asset management services on behalf of the hotel during the pre-construction period in exchange for a flat fee, and after opening of the hotel, in exchange for a fee based on the hotel gross revenues on an annual basis. In connection with the agreements, we agreed to provide certain guarantees of the hotel construction loan and mezzanine debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional discussion of these guarantees. Gaylord Opryland Luxury Waterpark In January 2017, we announced plans for a proposed $90 million investment to create a luxury indoor/outdoor waterpark adjacent to Gaylord Opryland and expected to open in 2018. The proposed project includes approximately 111,000 square feet of indoor water attractions and activities over three levels and approximately 106,000 square feet of outdoor water amenities. The project will include areas for adults, children and families, as well as dining options and bars. The project will be funded with cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility. Dividend Policy and Share Repurchase Program Pursuant to our current dividend policy, we plan to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend to stockholders in an amount equal to an annualized payment of at least 50% of adjusted funds from operations (as defined by us) less maintenance capital expenditures, or 100% of REIT taxable income, whichever is greater. During 2016, the Company board of directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $3.00 per share of common stock, or an aggregate of $153.0 million in cash. During 2015, the Company board of directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $2.70 per share of common stock, or an aggregate of $138.4 million in cash. During 2014, the Company board of directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $2.20 per share of common stock, or an aggregate of $112.0 million in cash. The declaration, timing and amount of dividends will be determined by future action of our board of directors. Our dividend policy may be altered at any time by our board of directors. On August 20, 2015, we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of our common stock using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit line. The repurchases were implemented through open market transactions on U.S. exchanges or in privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities laws, with any market purchases made during open trading window periods or pursuant to any applicable SEC Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The authorization expired December 31, 2016. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company repurchased 0.5 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $24.8 million, which the Company funded using cash on hand and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. The repurchased stock, which represents the entirety of shares that were repurchased under the authorization, was cancelled by the Company. 35 Table of Contents Our Current Operations Our ongoing operations are organized into three principal business segments: Hospitality, consisting of Gaylord Opryland, Gaylord Palms, Gaylord Texan, Gaylord National, the Inn at Opryland, the AC Hotel, and our investment in the Gaylord Rockies joint venture. Marriott manages each of our Gaylord Hotels properties, as well as the Inn at Opryland and the AC Hotel. Marriott will manage Gaylord Rockies upon its opening. Entertainment, consisting of the Grand Ole Opry, the Ryman Auditorium, WSM-AM, our other Nashville attractions and our investment in the Opry City Stage joint venture. As a result of the REIT conversion, we own our Entertainment businesses in TRSs, which conduct their business consistent with past practice, except for the management agreements with Marriott for the General Jackson, Wildhorse Saloon and Gaylord Springs discussed above. Corporate and Other, consisting of our corporate expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our total revenues were divided among these business segments as follows: Segment 2016 2015 2014 Hospitality 90 % 91 % 92 % Entertainment 10 % 9 % 8 % Corporate and Other 0 % 0 % 0 % Our goal is to become the nation premier hospitality REIT for group-oriented, destination hotel assets in urban and resort markets. We intend to leverage our existing hotel properties with All-in-One-Place self-contained service offerings, as well as a longer-term growth strategy that includes acquisitions of hotels, particularly in the group meetings sector of the hospitality industry, either alone or through joint ventures or alliances with one or more third parties. We intend to pursue attractive investment opportunities which meet our acquisition parameters, specifically, group-oriented large hotels and overflow hotels with existing or potential leisure appeal. Key Performance Indicators The operating results of our Hospitality segment are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our hotels and the quality of the customer mix at our hotels, which are managed by Marriott. These factors impact the price that Marriott can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities, such as food and beverage and meeting space. The following key performance indicators are commonly used in the hospitality industry: hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate ( ADR ) a price indicator calculated by dividing room revenue by the number of rooms sold; Revenue per Available Room ( RevPAR ) a summary measure of hotel results calculated by dividing room revenue by room nights available to guests for the period; Total Revenue per Available Room ( Total RevPAR ) a summary measure of hotel results calculated by dividing the sum of room, food and beverage and other ancillary service revenue by room nights available to guests for the period; and Net Definite Room Nights Booked a volume indicator which represents the total number of definite bookings for future room nights at our hotels confirmed during the applicable period, net of cancellations. Hospitality segment revenue from our occupied hotel rooms is recognized as earned on the close of business each day and from concessions and food and beverage sales at the time of the sale. Attrition fees, which are charged to groups when they do not fulfill the minimum number of room nights or minimum food and beverage spending requirements originally contracted for, as well as cancellation fees, are recognized as revenue in the period they are collected. Almost all of our Hospitality segment revenues are either cash-based or, for meeting and convention groups meeting credit criteria, billed and collected on a short-term receivables basis. The hospitality industry is capital intensive, and we rely on the ability of our hotels to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing and fund maintenance capital expenditures. 36 Table of Contents The results of operations of our Hospitality segment are affected by the number and type of group meetings and conventions scheduled to attend our hotels in a given period. A variety of factors can affect the results of any interim period, including the nature and quality of the group meetings and conventions attending our hotels during such period, which meetings and conventions have often been contracted for several years in advance, the level of attrition our hotels experience, and the level of transient business at our hotels during such period. Summary Financial Results The following table summarizes our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except percentages and per share data): 2016 % Change 2015 % Change 2014 Total revenues $ 1,149,207 5.2 % $ 1,092,124 4.9 % $ 1,040,991 Total operating expenses 935,402 0.6 % 930,062 4.8 % 887,886 Operating income 213,805 31.9 % 162,062 5.9 % 153,105 Net income 159,366 42.9 % 111,511 -11.8 % 126,452 Net income available to common shareholders 159,366 42.9 % 111,511 -7.9 % 121,035 Net income per share available to common shareholders fully diluted 3.11 44.0 % 2.16 -0.5 % 2.17 2016 Results as Compared to 2015 Results The increase in our total revenues during 2016, as compared to 2015, is attributable to increases in our Hospitality segment and Entertainment segment revenues of $45.0 million and $12.0 million, respectively, as discussed more fully below. Total Hospitality revenues in 2016 include $12.7 million in attrition and cancellation fee collections, a $5.8 million increase from 2015. The increase in total operating expenses during 2016, as compared to 2015, is primarily the result of increases in Hospitality segment and Entertainment segment expenses of $16.9 million and $8.5 million, respectively, partially offset by $19.2 million in impairment and other charges during 2015 that did not recur during 2016, as discussed more fully below. The above factors resulted in a $51.7 million increase in operating income for 2016, as compared to 2015. The $47.9 million increase in our net income in 2016, as compared to 2015, was due to the change in our operating income described above, and the following factors, each as described more fully below: A $15.1 million difference in other gains and losses, net between 2016 and 2015, due primarily to 2015 including losses for the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities associated with portions of warrants related to our previous 3.75% convertible notes. There was no such event in 2016. This change was partially offset by a $6.9 million gain in 2015 associated with the reimbursement of costs that were previously incurred related to our proposed development in Aurora, Colorado. These costs were impaired in 2012 as part of our strategic shift away from long-term development, but were reimbursed in 2015 by the current developer. A provision for income taxes of $3.4 million in 2016, as compared to a $11.9 million tax benefit in 2015. A $2.8 million loss from joint ventures during 2016 not incurred in 2015. 2015 Results as Compared to 2014 Results The increase in our total revenues during 2015, as compared to 2014, is attributable to increases in our Hospitality segment and Entertainment segment revenues of $40.4 million and $10.7 million, respectively, as discussed more fully below. Total Hospitality revenues in 2015 include $6.9 million in attrition and cancellation fee collections, a $2.0 million decrease from 2014. 37 Table of Contents The increase in total operating expenses during 2015, as compared to 2014, is primarily the result of impairment and other charges of $19.2 million incurred during 2015, as well as an increase in Hospitality segment and Entertainment segment expenses of $13.5 million and $8.0 million, respectively, as discussed more fully below. The above factors resulted in a $9.0 million increase in operating income for 2015, as compared to 2014. 38 Table of Contents The $14.9 million decrease in our net income in 2015, as compared to 2014, was due to the change in our operating income described above, and the following factors, each as described more fully below: A $34.3 million decrease in other gains and losses for 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily associated with 2014 including a $26.1 million gain on the sale of our rights in a letter of intent which entitled us to a portion of an economic interest in the income from the land underlying the new MGM casino project in National Harbor, Maryland. Additionally, during 2015, we incurred a $16.0 million increase in the loss on the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities associated with portions of warrants related to our previous 3.75% convertible notes, partially offset by a $6.9 million gain in 2015 associated with the reimbursement of costs that were previously incurred related to our proposed development in Aurora, Colorado. These costs were impaired in 2012 as part of our strategic shift away from long-term development, but were reimbursed in 2015 by the current developer. An increase in the benefit for income taxes of $10.4 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily attributable to a federal tax law change enacted in the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as changes in valuation allowance. Factors and Trends Contributing to Operating Performance in 2016 Compared to 2015 The most important factors and trends contributing to our operating performance in 2016 as compared to 2015 were: Increased occupancy and outside-the-room spending at Gaylord Palms during 2016, as compared to 2015. The increase in occupancy (an increase of 2.9 points of occupancy) is primarily the result of an increase in both groups and transient. The increase in outside-the-room spending (an increase of 12.4%) is primarily the result of an increase in banquets, as well as an increase attributable to new and refurbished dining outlets and an increase in attrition and cancellation fee collections. Increased ADR and outside-the-room spending at Gaylord Opryland during 2016, as compared to 2015. The increase in ADR (an increase of 3.0%) was primarily a result of an increase in both group and transient rate. The increase in outside-the-room spending (an increase of 2.9%) was primarily the result of increased banquet revenues from corporate groups, as well as increased attrition and cancellation fee collections. Increased outside-the-room spending at Gaylord Texan (an increase of 5.7%) during 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in banquet revenue. Increased net definite group room nights booked (an increase of 8.5%) during 2016, as compared to 2015. Increased revenue for our Entertainment segment (an increase of 12.3% for 2016, as compared to 2015), primarily due to increased attendance at the Grand Ole Opry, as well as increased ancillary business such as tours and retail at the Ryman Auditorium. Factors and Trends Contributing to Operating Performance in 2015 Compared to 2014 The most important factors and trends contributing to our operating performance in 2015 as compared to 2014 were: Increased outside-the-room spending at Gaylord Texan (6.0%) and Gaylord Opryland (4.3%) during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in banquet revenue. Increased occupancy at Gaylord Texan (an increase of 5.8 percentage points of occupancy, during 2015, as compared to 2014), primarily as a result of an increase in group business. Increased ADR at Gaylord Texan (an increase of 5.7% for 2015, as compared to 2014), primarily as a result of room rate increases for both groups and transient business. Decreased occupancy at Gaylord Opryland (a decrease of 1.3 points of occupancy for 2015, as compared to 2014) primarily as a result of a norovirus outbreak and a severe weather winter storm, which took place during January and February 2015. 39 Table of Contents In-the-year, for-the-year cancellations for 2015 decreased 6.2% as compared to 2014. Increased attrition levels for 2015, as compared to 2014, which partially offset the increase in operating income and Total RevPAR. Attrition for 2015 was 12.8% of bookings, compared to 10.6% in 2014. Increased net definite group room nights booked (an increase of 4.6% for 2015, as compared to 2014). Increased revenue for our Entertainment segment (an increase of 12.3% for 2015, as compared to 2014), primarily due to increased attendance and additional shows at the Grand Ole Opry, as well as increased ancillary business such as tours and retail.

Results of the AC Hotel are included as of its opening date in April 2015. (2) Hospitality operating income does not include impairment charges and preopening costs of $19.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively, during 2015. See the discussion of these items set forth below. (3) We calculate Hospitality RevPAR by dividing room revenue by room nights available to guests for the period. Hospitality RevPAR is not comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues. 40 Table of Contents (4) We calculate Hospitality Total RevPAR by dividing the sum of room, food and beverage, and other ancillary services revenue (which equals Hospitality segment revenue) by room nights available to guests for the period. Hospitality Total RevPAR is not comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues. (5) Same-store Hospitality performance metrics do not include the AC Hotel, which opened in April 2015. The increase in total Hospitality segment revenue in 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, is primarily due to increases in revenue of $17.4 million, $12.6 million and $10.7 million at Gaylord Palms, Gaylord Opryland and Gaylord Texan, respectively, as discussed below. The increase in total Hospitality segment revenue in 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014, is primarily due to increases in revenue of $18.1 million, $7.8 million and $5.1 million at Gaylord Texan, Gaylord Opryland and Gaylord National, respectively, as discussed below, as well as $7.0 million in revenue at the AC Hotel, which opened in April 2015. The percentage of group versus transient business based on rooms sold for our hospitality segment for the years ended December 31 was approximately as follows: 2016 2015 2014 Group 71 % 72 % 73 % Transient 29 % 28 % 27 % The type of group based on rooms sold for our hospitality segment for the years ended December 31 was approximately as follows: 2016 2015 2014 Corporate Groups 53 % 51 % 47 % Associations 33 % 35 % 36 % Other Groups 14 % 14 % 17 % The decrease in rooms operating expenses in 2016, as compared to 2015, is primarily attributable to a decrease at Gaylord National, as described below. The decrease in rooms operating expenses in 2015, as compared to 2014, is primarily attributable to a decrease at Gaylord Opryland, as described below, partially offset by rooms expense at the AC Hotel, which opened in April 2015. The increase in food and beverage operating expenses in 2016, as compared to 2015, is attributable to increases at Gaylord Palms and Gaylord Texan, as described below. The increase in food and beverage operating expenses in 2015, as compared to 2014, is attributable to increases at Gaylord Texan, Gaylord Opryland and Gaylord National, as described below. Other hotel expenses for the years ended December 31 consist of the following (in thousands): 2016 % Change 2015 % Change 2014 Administrative employment costs $ 108,475 0.9 % $ 107,495 7.1 % $ 100,380 Utilities 27,758 -2.2 % 28,394 -2.3 % 29,049 Property taxes 32,044 1.1 % 31,683 3.6 % 30,576 Other 154,497 6.2 % 145,417 -4.2 % 151,831 Total other hotel expenses $ 322,774 3.1 % $ 312,989 0.4 % $ 311,836 Administrative employment costs include salaries and benefits for hotel administrative functions, including, among others, senior management, accounting, human resources, sales, conference services, engineering and security. Administrative employment costs increased slightly during 2016, as compared to 2015. Utility costs decreased slightly during 2016, as compared to 2015. Property taxes increased slightly during 2016, as compared to 2015. Other expenses, which include supplies, advertising, maintenance costs and consulting costs, increased during 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily as a result of various increases at each of our Gaylord Hotels properties. 41 Table of Contents Administrative employment costs increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to previously unfilled positions at Gaylord Opryland and Gaylord Texan, as well as increased benefit costs at Gaylord National. Utility costs decreased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to decreases at Gaylord National and Gaylord Palms. Property taxes increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of an increase at Gaylord Texan. Other expenses decreased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of decreases at each of our Gaylord Hotels properties. As discussed above, each of our management agreements with Marriott for our Gaylord Hotels properties requires us to pay Marriott a base management fee of approximately 2% of gross revenues from the applicable property for each fiscal year or portion thereof. Additionally, an incentive fee is based on the profitability of our Gaylord Hotels properties calculated on a pooled basis. We incurred $20.8 million, $16.8 million and $19.1 million in total base management fees to Marriott related to our Hospitality segment properties during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in base management fees for 2016, as compared to 2015, and the decrease in 2015, as compared to 2014, is primarily attributable to an agreed adjustment to the calculation of management fees for 2015. We also incurred $4.4 million and $0.8 million related to incentive management fees for our Hospitality segment during 2016 and 2015, respectively. We did not incur an incentive fee to Marriott related to our Hospitality segment properties during 2014. Management fees are presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K net of the amortization of the deferred management rights proceeds discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included herein. Hospitality segment depreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily as a result of a decrease at Gaylord National, as described below.

Corporate and Other operating expenses increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of the pension settlement charge discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included herein, partially offset by a decrease in employment benefit costs. Corporate and Other depreciation and amortization expense decreased modestly in 2016, as compared to 2015. Corporate and Other depreciation and amortization expense decreased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to the continued disposal of certain assets that were no longer required as a result of our conversion to a REIT. 47 Table of Contents Operating Results Preopening costs We expense the costs associated with start-up activities and organization costs as incurred. Our preopening costs for 2015 and 2014 primarily relate to the AC Hotel. Operating Results Impairment and Other Charges Impairment charges in 2015 include costs associated with our decision to move forward with an expansion of the guest rooms and convention space at Gaylord Texan. This capital project replaced a previously contemplated expansion that we began incurring design costs for during 2007 and had been subsequently put on hold. As the new project is substantially different from the previously contemplated project, we incurred an impairment charge of $16.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, during 2015, we incurred $2.9 million in impairment charges related to assets previously used in special events programming that was discontinued. Non-Operating Results Affecting Net Income General The following table summarizes the other factors which affected our net income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except percentages): 2016 % Change 2015 % Change 2014 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized $ (63,906 ) 0.0 % $ (63,901 ) 4.0 % $ (61,447 ) Interest income 11,500 -7.1 % 12,384 2.6 % 12,075 Loss on extinguishment of debt n/a 100.0 % (2,148 ) Loss from joint ventures (2,794 ) -100.0 % n/a Other gains and (losses) 4,161 138.2 % (10,889 ) -146.5 % 23,400 (Provision) benefit for income taxes (3,400 ) -128.7 % 11,855 708.1 % 1,467 Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, remained stable at $63.9 million in 2016 and 2015, as increased interest expense associated with our $400 million 5% senior notes, which we issued in April 2015, was offset by lower interest expense associated with our credit facility due to lower interest terms associated with the refinancing of our facility, as well as 2015 including $1.9 million in interest expense related to the refinancing. The current year is also net of an increase in capitalized interest of $1.6 million. Our weighted average interest rate on our borrowings, excluding the write-off of deferred financing costs during the period, was 4.3% in 2016 as compared to 4.2% in 2015. Cash interest expense increased $4.1 million to $60.7 million in 2016 as compared to 2015, and noncash interest expense, which includes amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts, the write-off of deferred financing costs, and capitalized interest, decreased $4.1 million to $3.2 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, increased $2.5 million to $63.9 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, due primarily to increased interest expense associated with our $400 million 5% senior notes, which we issued in April 2015, and increased interest expense on our term loan B facility, which we entered into in June 2014. We also incurred $1.9 million in interest expense during 2015 related to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the refinancing of our credit facility. These increases were partially offset by the lack of interest expense associated with our 3.75% convertible notes, which matured in October 2014, and a decrease in interest expense associated with our credit facility due to a decrease in borrowings. Our weighted average interest rate on our borrowings, excluding the write-off of deferred financing costs during the period, was 4.2% in 2015 as compared to 4.9% in 2014. Cash interest expense increased $9.8 million to $56.6 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, and noncash interest expense decreased $7.4 million to $7.3 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. 48 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income for 2016, 2015 and 2014 primarily includes amounts earned on the bonds that we received in April 2008 in connection with the development of Gaylord National, which we hold as notes receivable. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt During 2014, we settled the repurchase of and subsequently cancelled $56.3 million of our 3.75% convertible notes in private transactions for aggregate consideration of $120.2 million. In addition, we settled the conversion of $15.3 million of convertible notes that were converted by holders. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.1 million in 2014 as a result of these transactions. Loss from Joint Ventures The loss from joint ventures for 2016 primarily represents amounts related to joint ventures that we entered into related to our joint venture investment in Opry City Stage in Times Square in New York City and the investment in Gaylord Rockies. The restaurant is anticipated to open in second quarter 2017, and Gaylord Rockies is anticipated to open in late 2018. Other Gains and (Losses) Other gains and (losses) for 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes gains of $2.5 million, $2.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively, from a fund associated with the Gaylord National bonds to reimburse us for certain marketing and maintenance expenses. Other gains and (losses) for 2015 and 2014 includes $20.2 million and $4.2 million, respectively, in losses on the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities associated with portions of the warrants associated with our 3.75% convertible notes. Other gains and (losses) for 2015 also includes a $6.9 million gain associated with the reimbursement of costs that were previously incurred related to our proposed development in Aurora, Colorado. These costs were impaired in 2012 as part of our strategic shift away from long-term development, but reimbursed in 2015 by the current developer. Other gains and (losses) for 2014 also includes a $26.1 million gain associated with the sale of our rights in a letter of intent which entitled us to a portion of an economic interest in the income from the land underlying the new MGM casino project in National Harbor, Maryland. (Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on ordinary taxable income and capital gains income from real estate investments that we distribute to our stockholders. We will, however, be subject to corporate income taxes on built-in gains (the excess of fair market value over tax basis at January 1, 2013) that result from gains on certain assets occurring prior to January 1, 2018. In addition, we will continue to be required to pay federal and state corporate income taxes on earnings of our TRSs. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded an income tax (provision) benefit of $(3.4) million, $11.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively. These results differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the REIT dividends paid deduction and the change in valuation allowance required at the TRSs. The increase in our provision for income taxes for 2016, as compared to the benefit in 2015, was due primarily to an increase in income in our TRSs. In addition, 2015 included a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of $5.2 million due to a federal tax law change enacted in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in our benefit for income taxes for 2015, as compared to 2014, resulted primarily from the federal tax law change discussed above, as well as a decrease in valuation allowance required at the TRSs. Because the TRSs were in a cumulative loss position at the end of 2015, the deferred tax asset realization depended entirely on the reversal of existing future taxable differences, which fluctuate based on the current year change in deferred tax balances. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows from Operating Activities . Cash flow from operating activities is the principal source of cash used to fund our operating expenses, interest payments on debt, maintenance capital expenditures, and dividends to stockholders. During 2016, our net cash flows provided by our operating activities were $293.6 million, reflecting primarily our income before depreciation expense, amortization expense, and other non-cash charges of approximately $278.6 million and favorable changes in working capital of approximately $15.0 million. The favorable changes in working capital primarily resulted from a decrease in accounts receivable due to the timing of collections. 49 Table of Contents During 2015, our net cash flows provided by our operating activities were $238.1 million, reflecting primarily our income before depreciation expense, amortization expense, impairment and other charges, loss on repurchase of warrants, and other non-cash charges of approximately $265.4 million, partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital of approximately $27.3 million. The unfavorable changes in working capital primarily resulted from a decrease in accrued expenses as a result of the timing of payments and an increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of collections. During 2014, our net cash flows provided by our operating activities were $252.2 million, reflecting primarily our income before depreciation expense, amortization expense, gain on sale of long-lived assets, and other non-cash charges of approximately $234.4 million and favorable changes in working capital of approximately $17.8 million. The favorable changes in working capital primarily resulted from a decrease in accounts receivable due to the timing of collections and an increase in accrued expenses as a result of the timing of payments. Cash Flows from Investing Activities . During 2016, our primary uses of funds for investing activities were purchases of property and equipment, which totaled $118.0 million and our investment of $70.1 million in the Gaylord Rockies joint venture. These uses of cash were partially offset by the receipt of $6.8 million in proceeds related to the sale of our rights in a letter of intent which entitled us to a portion of an economic interest in the income from the land underlying the new MGM casino project in National Harbor, Maryland. Purchases of property, plant and equipment consisted primarily of the renovation of a portion of the guestrooms at Gaylord Opryland, a freestanding event ballroom and expanded event space at Gaylord National, the expansion of the guest rooms and convention space at Gaylord Texan, a renovation of the Wildhorse Saloon, and ongoing maintenance for our existing properties. During 2015, our primary use of funds for investing activities were purchases of property and equipment, which totaled $79.8 million, partially offset by the receipt of $10.0 million in proceeds related to the sale of our rights in the letter of intent discussed above. Purchases of property, plant and equipment consisted primarily of an expansion of the Ryman Auditorium, the renovation of a portion of the guest rooms at Gaylord Opryland, and ongoing maintenance capital expenditures for our existing properties. During 2014, our primary uses of funds for investing activities were purchases of property and equipment, which totaled $58.4 million, and payments made associated with the purchase of the AC Hotel of $21.2 million, partially offset by the receipt of $9.4 million in proceeds related to the sale of our rights in the letter of intent discussed above. Purchases of property, plant and equipment consisted primarily of a rooms renovation project at Gaylord Texan and ongoing maintenance capital expenditures for our existing properties. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Our cash flows from financing activities reflect primarily the incurrence of and the repayment of long-term debt, the repurchase of stock, and the payment of dividends. During 2016, our net cash flows used in financing activities were approximately $111.5 million, primarily reflecting the payment of $151.2 million in cash dividends and the payment of $24.8 million to repurchase and retire 0.5 million shares of our common stock, partially offset by $72.0 million in net borrowings under our credit facility. During 2015, our net cash flows used in financing activities were approximately $183.5 million, primarily reflecting $284.1 million in repayments under our credit facility, the payment of $154.7 million to cash settle the remaining 4.7 million warrants associated with our 3.75% convertible notes, the payment of $131.3 million in cash dividends, and the payment of $11.2 million in deferred financing costs, partially offset by the issuance of $400.0 million in senior notes. During 2014, our net cash flows used in financing activities were approximately $177.9 million, primarily reflecting the payment of $177.4 million to cash settle 7.3 million of the warrants associated with our 3.75% convertible notes, the payment of $109.4 million in cash dividends, and the payment of $8.4 million in deferred financing costs. In addition, we paid $126.5 million in cash related to repurchases and the settlement of conversions of our 3.75% convertible notes prior to maturity and paid $232.2 million to repay the remaining 3.75% convertible notes at maturity. These outflows were partially offset by $475.0 million in net borrowings under our credit facility. 50 Table of Contents Liquidity At December 31, 2016, we had $59.1 million in unrestricted cash and $315.5 million available for borrowing under our credit facility. During 2016, we net borrowed $72.0 million under our credit facility, paid cash dividends of $151.2 million, incurred capital expenditures of $118.0 million, invested $70.1 million in the Gaylord Rockies joint venture, and paid $24.8 million to repurchase and retire 0.5 million shares of our common stock. These net outflows were offset by cash flows provided by operations discussed above, resulting in the increase in our cash balance from 2015 to 2016. We currently plan to declare dividends of $3.20 per share in 2017, payable in equal quarterly amounts, subject to future determinations as to the timing and amount by our board of directors. We anticipate investing in our operations during 2017 by spending between $238 million and $268 million in capital expenditures, which primarily includes ongoing maintenance capital of our current facilities, an expansion of the guest rooms and convention space at Gaylord Texan, a rooms renovation project at Gaylord Opryland, and the commencement of our luxury indoor/outdoor waterpark at Gaylord Opryland. We also expect to invest approximately $16.0 million in the Gaylord Rockies joint venture during the first quarter of 2017. We believe that our cash on hand and cash from operations will be adequate to fund our general short-term commitments, as well as: (i) normal operating expenses, (ii) interest expense on long-term debt obligations, (iii) capital lease and operating lease obligations, and (iv) declared dividends. If our existing cash and cash from operations were inadequate to fund such commitments, we could draw on our credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of covenants in the credit facility. We believe that drawing on this credit facility will not be necessary for general working capital purposes. We may, however, draw on our credit facility for operational and capital needs or other needs, as well as our investment in Gaylord Rockies, in the future. Our outstanding principal debt agreements, none of which mature prior to 2019, are described below. Based on current projections for compliance under our financial covenants contained in these agreements, we do not foresee a maturity issue prior to their scheduled maturity date. Principal Debt Agreements At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our outstanding debt. Credit Facility . On June 5, 2015, we entered into Amendment No. 2 (the Amendment ) among the Company, as a guarantor, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, certain other subsidiaries of the Company party thereto, as guarantors, the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, to the Company Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Facility ). Prior to the Amendment, the Credit Facility consisted of a $700.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the revolving credit facility ), a $300 million senior secured term loan (the term loan A ), and a $400 million senior secured term loan B (the term loan B ). Following the Amendment, the Credit Facility consists of the revolving credit facility and the term loan B, which matures on January 15, 2021. We paid off the previously outstanding Term Loan A during the second quarter of 2015 with a substantial portion of the proceeds from the Operating Partnership and RHP Finance Corporation ( Finco ) private placement of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due 2023 (the $400 Million 5% Senior Notes ), and the term loan A was eliminated. Pursuant to the Amendment, we extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility under the Credit Facility to June 5, 2019 and provided for two additional six-month extension options, at our election. In addition, the Amendment lowered the adjustable margin (the Applicable Margin ) for determining the interest rate on revolving loans based on our consolidated funded indebtedness to total asset value ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility). Interest on our borrowings under the revolving credit facility is payable quarterly, in arrears, for base rate-based loans and at the end of each interest rate period for LIBOR-based loans. The effective interest rate at December 31, 2016 was LIBOR plus 1.65%. Principal is payable in full at maturity. There is an unused commitment fee of 0.2% to 0.3% per year of the average unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The Credit Facility continues to be guaranteed by us, each of our four wholly-owned subsidiaries that own the Gaylord Hotels properties, and certain other of our subsidiaries. The Credit Facility continues to be secured by (i) a first mortgage lien on the real property of each of our Gaylord Hotels properties, (ii) pledges of equity interests in our subsidiaries that own the Gaylord Hotels properties, (iii) our personal property and the personal property of the Operating Partnership and our subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Facility, and (iv) all proceeds and products from our Gaylord Hotels properties. Advances are subject to a 55% borrowing base, based on the appraisal value of the Gaylord Hotels properties (reduced to 50% in the event a hotel property is sold). 51 Table of Contents In addition, the Credit Facility contains certain covenants which, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, investments, dividends, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, liens and encumbrances and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. The material financial covenants, ratios or tests contained in the Credit Facility are as follows: We must maintain a consolidated funded indebtedness to total asset value ratio as of the end of each calendar quarter of not more than .65 to 1.0. We must maintain a consolidated tangible net worth (as defined in the Credit Facility) of not less than $175 million plus 75% of the proceeds received by us or any of our subsidiaries in connection with any equity issuance. We must maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Facility, of not less than 1.50 to 1.00. We must maintain an implied debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of adjusted net operating income to monthly principal and interest that would be required if the outstanding balance were amortized over 25 years at an assumed fixed rate) of not less than 1.60 to 1.00. If an event of default shall occur and be continuing under the Credit Facility, the commitments under the Credit Facility may be terminated and the principal amount outstanding under the Credit Facility, together with all accrued unpaid interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, may be declared immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2016, $382.4 million of borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Facility, and the lending banks had issued $2.1 million of letters of credit under the facility, which left $315.5 million of availability under the Credit Facility (subject to the satisfaction of debt incurrence tests under the indentures governing our $350 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2021 (the $350 Million 5% Senior Notes ) and $400 Million 5% Senior Notes. As a result of the Amendment, we wrote off $1.9 million of deferred financing costs during 2015, which is included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. $400 Million Term B Loan Facility. On June 18, 2014, we amended the Credit Facility such that we added an additional senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $400.0 million to the Credit Facility. Proceeds from the term loan B were used to repay revolving loans under the Credit Facility, to repay our 3.75% convertible notes and to settle a part of the warrant transactions described below. The term loan B has a maturity date of January 15, 2021 and borrowings bear interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus an adjustable margin, subject to a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. At December 31, 2016, the interest rate on the term loan B was LIBOR plus 2.75% and $390.0 million remained outstanding. The term loan B amortizes in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.0% of the original principal amount of $400.0 million with the balance due at maturity. In addition, if for any fiscal year, there is Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the agreement), an additional principal amount is required. We have not been required to make additional principal payments under the Excess Cash Flow requirement in 2016, 2015 or 2014. Amounts borrowed under the term loan B that are repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. At closing, we drew down on the term loan B in full. Consistent with our other loans under our Credit Facility, the term loan B is guaranteed by the Company, each of our four wholly-owned subsidiaries that own the Gaylord Hotels-branded properties, and certain other of our subsidiaries. The term loan B is secured by (i) a first mortgage lien on the real property of each of our Gaylord Hotels properties, (ii) pledges of equity interests in our subsidiaries that own the Gaylord Hotels properties, (iii) the personal property of the Company, the Operating Partnership and the guarantors and (iv) all proceeds and products from our Gaylord Hotels properties. Amounts drawn on the term loan B are subject to a 55% borrowing base, based on the appraisal value of the Gaylord Hotels properties (reduced to 50% in the event a hotel property is sold). The term loan B is subject to certain covenants contained in the Credit Facility, which, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, investments, dividends, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, liens and encumbrances and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. The term loan B is subject to substantially all of the events of default provided for the Credit Facility (other than the financial maintenance covenants). If an event of default shall occur and be continuing, the commitments under the term loan B may be terminated and the principal amount outstanding under the term loan B, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, may be declared immediately due and payable. 52 Table of Contents $350 Million 5% Senior Notes. On April 3, 2013, the Operating Partnership and Finco completed the private placement of $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2021, which are guaranteed by the Company and its subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Facility. The $350 Million 5% Senior Notes and guarantees were issued pursuant to an indenture by and among the issuing subsidiaries and the guarantors and U.S. Bank National Association as trustee. The $350 Million 5% Senior Notes have a maturity date of April 15, 2021 and bear interest at 5% per annum, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The $350 Million 5% Senior Notes are general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the issuing subsidiaries and rank equal in right of payment with such subsidiaries existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to future subordinated indebtedness, if any. The $350 Million 5% Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to the issuing subsidiaries secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The guarantees rank equally in right of payment with the applicable guarantor existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of such guarantor. The $350 Million 5% Senior Notes will be effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness of any guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations of the Operating Partnership subsidiaries that do not guarantee the $350 Million 5% Senior Notes. The $350 Million 5% Senior Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at a redemption price expressed as a percentage of the principal amount thereof, which percentage is 103.75%, 102.50%, 101.25%, and 100.00% beginning on April 15 of 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. In connection with the issuance of the $350 Million 5% Senior Notes, we completed a registered offer to exchange the $350 Million 5% Senior Notes for registered notes with substantially identical terms as the $350 Million 5% Senior Notes in November 2013. $400 Million 5% Senior Notes . On April 14, 2015, the Operating Partnership and Finco completed the private placement of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2023. The $400 Million 5% Senior Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company issuing subsidiaries and are guaranteed by the Company and its subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Facility. The $400 Million 5% Senior Notes and guarantees were issued pursuant to an indenture by and among the issuing subsidiaries and the guarantors and U.S. Bank National Association as trustee. The $400 Million 5% Senior Notes have a maturity date of April 15, 2023 and bear interest at 5% per annum, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The $400 Million 5% Senior Notes are general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the issuing subsidiaries and rank equal in right of payment with such subsidiaries existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, including the $350 Million 5% Senior Notes, and senior in right of payment to future subordinated indebtedness, if any. The $400 Million 5% Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to the issuing subsidiaries secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The guarantees rank equally in right of payment with the applicable guarantor existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of such guarantor. The $400 Million 5% Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness of any guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations of the Operating Partnership subsidiaries that do not guarantee the $400 Million 5% Senior Notes. The issuing subsidiaries may redeem the $400 Million 5% Senior Notes before April 15, 2018, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date plus a make-whole redemption premium. The $400 Million 5% Senior Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after April 15, 2018 at a redemption price expressed as a percentage of the principal amount thereof, which percentage is 103.75%, 102.50%, 101.25%, and 100.00% beginning on April 15 of 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. In connection with the issuance of the $400 Million 5% Senior Notes, we completed a registered offer to exchange the $400 Million 5% Senior Notes for registered notes with substantially identical terms as the $400 Million 5% Senior Notes in September 2015. 53 Table of Contents Additional Debt Limitations . Pursuant to the terms of the management agreements and pooling agreement with Marriott, we are subject to certain debt limitations described below. The management agreements provide for the following limitations on indebtedness encumbering a hotel: The aggregate principal balance of all mortgage and mezzanine debt encumbering the hotel shall be no greater than 75% of the fair market value of the hotel; and The ratio of (a) aggregate Operating Profit (as defined in the management agreement) in the 12 months prior to the closing on the mortgage or mezzanine debt to (b) annual debt service for the hotel shall equal or exceed 1.2:1; but is subject to the pooling agreement described below. The pooled limitations on Secured Debt (as defined in the pooling agreement) are as follows: The aggregate principal balance of all mortgage and mezzanine debt on Pooled Hotels (as defined in the pooling agreement), shall be no more than 75% of the fair market value of Pooled Hotels. The ratio of (a) aggregate Operating Profit (as defined in the pooling agreement) of Pooled Hotels in the 12 months prior to closing on any mortgage or mezzanine debt, to (b) annual debt service for the Pooled Hotels, shall equal or exceed 1.2:1. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As described in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included herein, we have invested in a joint venture that will build and subsequently own Gaylord Rockies and expect to fund an additional investment amount of approximately $16.0 million in 2017. In connection with this investment, we agreed to provide guarantees of the hotel construction loan, including a principal repayment guarantee of up to $21 million of the total $500 million principal amount of the construction loan previously obtained from a consortium of eight banks, with such amount reducing to $14 million and further reducing to $8.75 million upon the hotel satisfaction of designated debt service coverage requirements following completion and opening of the hotel. We have also provided a completion guarantee under the construction loan capped at our pro rata share of all costs necessary to complete the project within the time specified in the senior loan documents. Further, we have agreed to a guarantee capped at our pro rata share of the joint venture obligations under the construction loan prior to the hotel opening related to interest accruing under the construction loan and the operating expenses of the property (estimated pro rata share of interest prior to the hotel opening is $9.8 million). In addition to guarantees related to the construction loan, we agreed to provide a guarantee of the mezzanine debt related to the hotel including a payment guarantee capped at $8.75 million for which we are only liable in the event there is a casualty or condemnation event at the hotel and the construction lenders elect to apply those proceeds to the construction loan balance and release the construction loan guarantees and liens. The guarantee related to the mezzanine debt also includes an uncapped completion guarantee and an uncapped guarantee of the joint venture obligations under the mezzanine loan prior to the hotel opening related to interest accruing under the mezzanine loan and the operating expenses of the property to the extent not already satisfied by the parties under the guarantees related to the construction loan. At December 31, 2016, we have not recorded any liability in the consolidated balance sheet associated with these guarantees. In addition, we enter into commitments under letters of credit, primarily for the purpose of securing our deductible obligations with our insurers, and lending banks under our credit facility had issued $2.1 million of letters of credit at December 31, 2016. Except as set forth in these paragraphs, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonable likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 54 Table of Contents Commitments and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016, including long-term debt and operating and capital lease commitments (amounts in thousands): Contractual obligations Total amounts committed Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years After 5 years Long-term debt (1) $ 1,522,400 $ $ 382,400 $ 740,000 $ 400,000 Capital leases 659 20 42 45 552 Operating leases (2) 618,007 4,279 8,826 9,364 595,538 Construction commitments (3) 20,912 20,912 Other commitments (4) 15,959 15,959 Total contractual obligations $ 2,177,937 $ 41,170 $ 391,268 $ 749,409 $ 996,090 (1) Long-term debt commitments do not include approximately $278.7 million in interest payments projected to be due in future years (less than 1 year $60.7 million; 1-3 years $115.5 million; 3-5 years $76.7 million; more than 5 years $25.8 million) based on the stated interest rates on our fixed-rate debt and the rates in effect at December 31, 2016 for our variable-rate debt. Variable rates, as well as outstanding principal balances, could change in future periods. See Principal Debt Agreements above for a discussion of our outstanding long-term debt. See Supplemental Cash Flow Information in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of the interest we paid during 2016, 2015 and 2014. (2) Total operating lease commitments of $618.0 million includes the 75-year operating lease agreement we entered into during 1999 for 65.3 acres of land located in Osceola County, Florida where Gaylord Palms is located. (3) With respect to our properties that are operated under management agreements with Marriott, we are obligated to maintain an FF&E reserve account for future planned and emergency-related capital expenditures at these properties. The amount funded into each of these reserve accounts is determined pursuant to the management agreements. For fiscal year 2017, the amount funded into the reserve accounts will be 5.0% of the respective properties total annual revenue. At December 31, 2016, $20.9 million was held in FF&E reserve accounts for future capital expenditures at our properties. According to the terms of each management agreement with Marriott, the reserve funds are to be held by Marriott in a restricted cash account. Although it is not required that such funds be expended in a given year, each management agreement provides any excess funds will carry over for use in future years. (4) Other commitments represents our expected capital contribution in the Gaylord Rockies project. Our total capital contribution is expected to be $86.1 million, of which $70.1 million was paid in 2016. We expect to fund the remainder of our capital contribution during the first quarter of 2017. Our capital contributions will be funded from available cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash payments associated with our defined benefit pension plan, our non-qualified retirement plan and our defined benefit postretirement health care and life insurance plan, we cannot make reasonably certain estimates of the period of cash settlement. Therefore, these obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. During 2017, we expect to contribute $0, $0.9 million and $0.3 million, respectively, to our defined benefit pension plan, our non-qualified retirement plan and our defined benefit postretirement health care and life insurance plan. See Note 8 and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion related to these obligations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accounting estimates are an integral part of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the financial reporting process and are based upon current judgments. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their complexity and the possibility that future events affecting them may differ materially from our current judgments and estimates. 55 Table of Contents This listing of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for management judgment regarding accounting policy. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Revenue recognition. Revenue from our occupied hotel rooms is recognized as earned on the close of business each day and from concessions and food and beverage sales at the time of the sale. Revenues from other services at our hotels, such as spa, parking, and transportation services are recognized at the time services are provided. Cancellation fees, as well as attrition fees, which are charged to groups when they do not fulfill the minimum number of room nights or minimum food and beverage spending requirements originally contracted for, are recognized as revenue in the period they are collected. Revenues from the Entertainment segment are recognized when services are provided or goods are shipped, as applicable. Impairment of long-lived and other assets. In accounting for our long-lived and other assets (including our notes receivable associated with the development of Gaylord National), we assess our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets that will continue to be used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset or asset group carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows, the asset group is considered to be impaired. The impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value, which is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses that utilize comprehensive cash flow projections, as well as observable market data to the extent available. Recoverability of the notes receivable associated with Gaylord National is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the notes to the fair value of the notes. If the carrying value is greater than the fair value, we then assess if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If the decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary, which is based on our intent and ability to hold the notes receivable to maturity and whether we expect to receive all debt service payments due under the notes, then the notes are impaired. Stock-based compensation. For awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units, we measure compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant. The fair value of time-based awards is determined based on the closing trading price of our common shares on the measurement date, which is generally the date of grant. The fair value of performance-based awards based on a market condition is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. A Monte Carlo simulation requires the use of a number of assumptions, including historical volatility and correlation of the price of our common shares and the price of the common shares of a peer group, a risk-free rate of return, and an expected term. For each award, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. For both time-based awards and performance-based awards, once the total amount of compensation expense is determined on the date of the grant, no adjustments are made to the amount recognized each period, unless there is a change to a non-market condition assumption. No compensation expense is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our fixed assets. Amortization expense for leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets. The lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions, including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets, as well as specific market and economic conditions. While management believes its estimates are reasonable, a change in the estimated lives could affect our depreciation expense in future periods. Income taxes. As a REIT, generally we will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on ordinary taxable income and capital gains income from real estate investments that we distribute to our stockholders. We will, however, be subject to corporate income taxes on built-in gains (the excess of fair market value over tax basis at January 1, 2013) that result from gains on certain assets occurring prior to January 1, 2018. In addition, we will continue to be required to pay federal and state corporate income taxes on earnings of our TRSs. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 56 Table of Contents We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes is increased by recording a reserve, in the form of a valuation allowance, against the estimated deferred tax assets that will not ultimately be recoverable. In addition, we must deal with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in the calculation of tax liabilities and are subject to routine income tax audits. We provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. We make this assessment based on only the technical merits of the tax position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements and a liability for unrecognized tax benefits is established. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. To the extent that we prevail in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or are required to pay amounts in excess of the liability established, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected. Pension and postretirement benefits other than pension plans. The costs and obligations of our pension and postretirement benefits other than pension plans recognized in our consolidated financial statements are determined from actuarial valuations, which are dependent on significant assumptions, judgments, and estimates. These assumptions, judgments, and estimates, which include discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled at the measurement date, expected return on plan assets and mortality rates, are evaluated at each annual measurement date. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from these assumptions, judgments, and estimates are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. The discount rate utilized for determining future benefit obligations is based on the market rate of a broad-based index of high-quality bonds receiving an AA- or better rating from a recognized rating agency on our annual measurement date that is matched to the future expected cash flows of the benefit plans by annual periods. The resulting discount rate decreased from 3.9% for the pension plan and 3.6% for the postretirement benefits other than pension plans at December 31, 2015 to 3.7% and 3.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. We determine the overall expected long-term return on plan assets based on our estimate of the return that plan assets will provide over the period that benefits are expected to be paid out. In preparing this estimate, we assess the rates of return on each allocation of plan assets, return premiums generated by portfolio management, and advice by our third-party actuary and investment consultants. The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption that is determined at the beginning of each year and generally does not significantly change annually. While historical returns are considered, the rate of return assumption is primarily based on projections of expected returns, using economic data and financial models to estimate the probability of returns. The probability distribution of annualized returns for the portfolio using current asset allocations is used to determine the expected range of returns for a ten-to-twenty-year horizon. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension expense. The expected return on plan assets assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for 2016 and 2015 was 6.5%. Actual return on plan assets for 2016 and 2015 was 10.0% and (2.9)%, respectively. Our historical actual return averaged 5.8% for the ten-year period ended December 31, 2016. In the future, we may make additional discretionary contributions to the plan or we could be required to make mandatory cash funding payments. The mortality rate assumption used for determining future benefit obligations as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was based on the RP 2014 Adjusted to 2016 Total Dataset Mortality Tables. In estimating the health care cost trend rate, we consider our actual health care cost experience, industry trends, and advice from our third-party actuary. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expense. For example, holding all other assumptions constant, a 1% increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate related to the retirement plan would increase or decrease, respectively, 2016 net periodic pension expense by approximately $0.1 million. Likewise, a 1% increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase, respectively, 2016 net periodic pension expense by approximately $0.6 million. 57 Table of Contents Legal Contingencies. We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. Recently Issued Accounting Standards For a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Our primary exposures to market risk are from changes in interest rates and changes in asset values of investments that fund our pension plan. See Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more discussion on how interest rate increases affect our operations and financial condition. Risk Related to Changes in Interest Rates Borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit portion of our Credit Facility currently bear interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 1.65%, subject to adjustment as defined in the agreement. If LIBOR were to increase by 100 basis points, our annual interest cost on the $382.4 million in borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit portion of our Credit Facility at December 31, 2016 would increase by approximately $3.8 million. Borrowings outstanding under our $400 million term loan B currently bear interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 2.75%, subject to adjustment as defined in the agreement. If LIBOR were to increase by 100 basis points, our annual interest cost on the $390.0 million in borrowings outstanding under our $400 million term loan B at December 31, 2016 would increase by approximately $3.9 million. Certain of our outstanding cash balances are occasionally invested overnight with high credit quality financial institutions. We do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash at December 31, 2016. As a result, the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at December 31, 2016, if any, is low. Risk Related to Changes in Asset Values that Fund our Pension Plans The expected rates of return on the assets that fund our defined benefit pension plan are based on the asset allocation of the plan and the long-term projected return on those assets, which represent a diversified mix of equity securities, fixed income securities and cash. At December 31, 2016, the value of the investments in the pension fund was $65.4 million, and an immediate ten percent decrease in the value of the investments in the fund would have reduced the value of the fund by approximately $6.5 million. Summary Based upon our overall market risk exposures at December 31, 2016, we believe that the effects of changes in interest rates and asset values of investments that fund our pension plan could be material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
