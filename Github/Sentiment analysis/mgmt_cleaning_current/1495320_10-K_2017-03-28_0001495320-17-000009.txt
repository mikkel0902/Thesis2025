Discontinued Operations In June 2014, we entered into a five-year agreement with Mitsubishi Corporation Fashion Company and Look Inc. for the importation and distribution of Vera Bradley products in Japan. As a result of moving to this wholesale business model, we exited our direct business in Japan during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and have accounted for it as a discontinued operation. Consolidated income statement and Direct segment results for the current and prior periods presented are reported on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise stated. How We Assess the Performance of Our Business In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. Net Revenues Net revenues reflect revenues from the sale of our merchandise and from distribution and shipping and handling fees, less returns and discounts. Revenues for the Direct segment reflect sales through our full-line and factory outlet stores, verabradley.com, direct-to-consumer eBay sales, and our annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Revenues for the Indirect segment reflect sales to specialty retail partners, department stores, national accounts, third party e-commerce sites, our wholesale customer in Japan, and third party inventory liquidators. As of January 28, 2017 , our specialty retail locations have decreased to approximately 2,600 locations from their peak during fiscal 2013 of approximately 3,600 locations. Comparable Sales Comparable sales are calculated based upon our stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months and net revenues from our e-commerce operations. Comparable store sales are calculated based solely upon our stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months. Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales and comparable store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage. Some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales differently than we do. As a result, data in this report regarding our comparable sales and comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other companies. Non-comparable sales include sales from stores not included in comparable sales or comparable store sales. Measuring the change in year-over-year comparable sales allows us to evaluate how our store base and e-commerce operations are performing. Various factors affect our comparable sales, including: Overall economic trends; Consumer preferences and fashion trends; Competition; 33 Table of Contents Timing of our releases of new patterns and collections; Changes in our product mix; Pricing and level of promotions; Amount of store and mall traffic; Level of customer service that we provide in stores; Our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; Number of stores we open and close in any period; and Timing and success of promotional and advertising efforts. In recent years, comparable store sales have declined. Consequently, we do not currently have any new full-line stores planned to be opened during fiscal 2018. We expect to relocate or close up to 15 underperforming full-line stores over the next two years. We plan to open six new factory outlet stores during fiscal 2018. During the past five years, we opened an average of approximately 20 new stores annually. We will continue to evaluate our plans for store openings in future years in light of demand and store performance. Gross Profit Gross profit is equal to our net revenues less our cost of sales. Cost of sales includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise, distribution center costs, operations overhead, duty, and all inbound freight costs incurred. The components of our reported cost of sales may not be comparable to those of other retail and wholesale companies. Gross profit can be impacted by changes in volume; fluctuations in sales price; operational efficiencies, such as leveraging of fixed costs; promotional activities, such as free shipping; commodity prices, such as cotton prices; and labor costs. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (SG&A) SG&A expenses include selling; advertising, marketing, and product development; and administrative. Selling expenses include Direct business expenses such as store expenses, employee compensation, and store occupancy and supply costs, as well as Indirect business expenses consisting primarily of employee compensation and other expenses associated with sales to Indirect retailers. Advertising, marketing, and product development expenses include employee compensation, media costs, creative production expenses, marketing agency fees, new product design costs, public relations expenses, and market research expenses. A portion of our advertising expenses may be reimbursed by Indirect retailers, and such amount is classified as other income. Administrative expenses include employee compensation for corporate functions, corporate headquarters occupancy costs, consulting and software expenses, and charitable donations. Impairment charges are included in SG&A expenses and totaled $12.7 million , $2.8 million and $0.4 million for the fiscal years ended January 28, 2017 , January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , respectively. Other Income We support many of our Indirect retailers marketing efforts by distributing certain catalogs and promotional mailers to current and prospective customers. Our Indirect retailers reimburse us for a portion of the cost to produce these materials. Reimbursement received is recorded as other income. The related cost to design, produce, and distribute the catalogs and mailers is recorded as SG&A expense. Other income also includes proceeds from the sales of tickets to our annual outlet sale. Operating Income Operating income is equal to gross profit less SG&A expenses plus other income. Operating income excludes interest income, interest expense, and income taxes. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations is equal to operating income less net interest expense and income taxes. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is equal to the loss from the results of operations related to the direct Japan business, which was exited in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, adjusted for the associated tax benefit. 34 Table of Contents Net Income Net income is equal to the sum of income from continuing operations and loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes. Results of Operations The following tables summarize key components of our consolidated results of operations for the last three fiscal years, both in dollars and as a percentage of our net revenues.

Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (3) Includes full-line and factory outlet stores. (4) Comparable sales are calculated based upon our stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months and net revenues from our e-commerce operations. Decrease is reported as a percentage of the comparable sales for the same period in the prior fiscal year. Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage. (5) Dollars not in thousands. Average net revenues per gross square foot are calculated by dividing total net revenues for our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period by total gross square footage for those stores. (6) Impairment charges, related to underperforming stores, recognized totaled $12.7 million , $2.8 million and $0.4 million , during the fiscal years ended January 28, 2017 , January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , respectively. Payment Card Incident Description of Event On September 15, 2016, we received information from law enforcement regarding a potential data security issue related to our retail store network. Findings from the investigation show unauthorized access to our payment processing system and the installation of a program that looked for payment card data. The program was specifically designed to find track data in the magnetic stripe of a payment card that may contain the card number, cardholder name, expiration date, and internal verification code as the data was being routed through the affected payment system. There is no indication that other customer information was at risk. Payment cards used at Vera Bradley store locations between July 25, 2016 and September 23, 2016 may have been affected. Not all cards used in stores during this time frame were affected. Cards used on verabradley.com were not affected. We have resolved this incident and continue to work with the computer security firm to further strengthen the security of our systems to help prevent this from happening in the future. We continue to support law enforcement investigation and also promptly notified the payment card networks so that the banks that issue payment cards could initiate heightened monitoring on the affected cards. Expenses Incurred and Amounts Accrued During fiscal 2017, we recorded an immaterial amount of expense relating to the Payment Card Incident. Expenses included costs to investigate the Payment Card Incident and obtain legal and other professional services. 36 Table of Contents Future Costs We expect to incur additional legal and professional services, as well as expenses and capital investments for remediation activities associated with the Payment Card Incident and will recognize the expenses as incurred. In addition, payment card companies and associations may require us to reimburse them for unauthorized card charges and costs to replace cards and may also impose fines or penalties in connection with the Payment Card Incident, and enforcement authorities may also impose fines or other remedies against us. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss or range of loss related to any fines or penalties that may be assessed. The Payment Card Incident, including customer response and any possible third party claims or assessments from payment card companies, could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. We expect that our insurance coverage will offset most of the expenses for the investigation and other non-remediation legal and professional services associated with the incident, possible third party claims, as well as fines, penalties, or other expenses, if any, imposed by payment card companies, as discussed above. Insurance Coverage We maintain $15.0 million of cyber security insurance coverage above a $0.1 million deductible. Restructuring and Other Charges Affecting Comparability of the Fifty-Two Weeks Ended January 28, 2017, and January 30, 2016 Fifty-Two Weeks Ended January 28, 2017 In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we recognized a benefit of $1.6 million for certain income tax reserve releases as a result of the conclusion of an IRS audit (reflected in income tax expense). Fifty-Two Weeks Ended January 30, 2016 In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we closed our manufacturing facility located in New Haven, Indiana. We incurred restructuring and other charges during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 of approximately $3.4 million ( $2.1 million after the associated tax benefit), related to the facility closing. These charges included: Severance and benefit costs of approximately $1.7 million ; Lease termination costs of approximately $0.7 million ; Inventory-related charges of approximately $0.6 million ; and Other associated net costs, which include accelerated depreciation related to fixed assets, of approximately $0.4 million . These charges are reflected in cost of sales in our Consolidated Financial Statements. All production from the facility was absorbed by our third-party manufacturing suppliers. There are no remaining liabilities associated with the facility closure. Additional charges, incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, affecting comparability of the financial results totaled approximately $1.8 million ( $1.3 million after the associated tax benefit). These charges included: $1.2 million due to a retail store early lease termination agreement (reflected in selling, general, and administrative expenses) and $0.6 million related to an increase in income tax reserves for uncertain federal and state tax positions related to research and development tax credits (reflected in income tax expense). See Note 15 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, herein, for additional information. Impairment Charges Property, plant, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The reviews are conducted at the lowest identifiable level of cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the property, plant, and equipment are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, as further defined in Note 2 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, herein. An impairment charge of $12.7 million , $2.8 million and $0.4 million was recognized in the fiscal years ended January 28, 2017 , January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , respectively, for assets related to underperforming stores and is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income and in impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The impairment charges are included in the Direct segment. 37 Table of Contents Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Net Revenues For fiscal 2017 , net revenues decreased $16.7 million , or 3.3% , to $485.9 million , from $502.6 million for fiscal 2016 . Direct. For fiscal 2017 , net revenues increased $3.9 million , or 1.1% , to $355.2 million , from $351.3 million for fiscal 2016 . This change resulted from a $28.0 million contribution of revenue from our non-comparable stores, which included ten additional stores in the current year, partially offset by a comparable sales decrease of $23.7 million , or 7.0% . The decrease in comparable sales includes a 6.7% decrease in e-commerce sales and a 7.1% decrease in comparable store sales. The decline in comparable sales was primarily due to year-over-year declines in store and e-commerce traffic, as well as lower levels of promotional activity in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The aggregate number of full-line and factory outlet stores grew from 150 at the end of fiscal 2016 to 159 at the end of fiscal 2017 , which excludes one store closed at the end of the fourth quarter. Indirect. For fiscal 2017 , net revenues decreased $20.5 million , or 13.6% , to $130.8 million , from $151.3 million for fiscal 2016 , primarily due to lower orders from specialty retail accounts. Gross Profit For fiscal 2017 , gross profit decreased $5.2 million , or 1.8% , to $276.0 million , from $281.2 million for fiscal 2016 . As a percentage of net revenues, gross profit increased to 56.8% for fiscal 2017 , from 55.9% for fiscal 2016 . The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to sourcing efficiencies (partly due to reduced overhead costs resulting from the closing of our domestic manufacturing facility), partially offset by increased promotional activity at our factory outlet stores. In addition, gross profit in the first quarter of the comparable prior-year period was impacted by restructuring charges of $3.4 million related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, as discussed in more detail in Note 15 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A) For fiscal 2017 , SG&A expenses increased $12.4 million , or 5.2% , to $249.2 million , from $236.8 million for fiscal 2016 . As a percentage of net revenues, SG&A expenses were 51.3% and 47.1% for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 , respectively. The increase in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to $10.0 million in incremental store impairment charges and $7.1 million in new store expenses in the current-year period, partially offset by a $2.7 million reduction in incentive compensation due to Company performance. In addition, the first quarter of the prior-year period included $1.2 million in expense related to a retail store early termination agreement which did not recur in the current-year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to the aforementioned items and fixed expenses being spread over lower comparable sales and deleveraging of store operating expenses as a result of lower comparable store sales. Other Income For fiscal 2017 , other income decreased $1.1 million , or 43.9% , to $1.3 million , from $2.4 million for fiscal 2016 , primarily due to a decrease in participation in the co-op mailer program. Operating Income For fiscal 2017 , operating income decreased $18.5 million , or 39.6% , to $28.2 million from $46.7 million for fiscal 2016 . As a percentage of net revenues, operating income was 5.8% and 9.3% for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 , respectively. Operating income decreased due to the factors described above. The following table provides additional information about our operating income (in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended $ Change % Change January 28, 2017 January 30, 2016 Operating Income: Direct $ 62,577 $ 74,114 $ (11,537 ) (15.6 )% Indirect 50,955 60,409 (9,454 ) (15.6 )% Less: Unallocated corporate expenses (85,312 ) (87,801 ) 2,489 (2.8 )% Operating income $ 28,220 $ 46,722 $ (18,502 ) (39.6 )% Direct . For fiscal 2017 , operating income decreased $11.5 million , or 15.6% . As a percentage of Direct segment net revenues, operating income in the Direct segment was 17.6% and 21.1% for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The decrease in operating 38 Table of Contents income as a percentage of Direct segment net revenues was primarily due to $10.0 million in incremental store impairment charges, $7.1 million in new store expenses, and deleveraging of store operating expenses as a result of lower comparable store sales, partially offset by $3.5 million in restructuring and other charges related to the closure of our manufacturing facility and a retail store early termination agreement in the comparable prior-year period, as well as an increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, as described above. Indirect . For fiscal 2017 , operating income decreased $9.5 million , or 15.6% . As a percentage of Indirect segment net revenues, operating income in the Indirect segment was 39.0% and 39.9% for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of Indirect segment net revenues was primarily due to lower sales, partially offset by an increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, as described above, as well as $1.1 million in restructuring charges related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in the comparable prior-year period. Corporate Unallocated . For fiscal 2017 , unallocated expenses decreased $2.5 million , or 2.8% . The decrease in unallocated expenses was primarily due to a decrease in incentive compensation as a result of Company performance. Interest Expense, Net. For fiscal 2017 , net interest expense decreased $0.1 million , or 32.3% , to $0.2 million , from $0.3 million in fiscal 2016 . Income Tax Expense. For fiscal 2017 , we recorded income tax expense of $8.3 million at an effective tax rate of 29.5% , compared to 40.7% for fiscal 2016 . The year-over year decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the release of approximately $1.6 million of certain income tax reserves as a result the conclusion of an IRS audit. The prior year included $0.6 million of income tax reserves for uncertain tax positions related to research and development tax credits. Net Income For fiscal 2017 , net income decreased $7.8 million , or 28.3% , to $19.8 million from $27.6 million in fiscal 2016 . The current-year period included $12.7 million ( $8.0 million after the associated tax benefit) in store impairment charges, partially offset by a $1.6 million tax benefit, as described in Note 6 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. The comparable prior-year period included restructuring and other charges of $5.2 million ( $3.4 million after the associated tax benefit), as described in Note 15 herein, and $2.8 million in store impairment charges ( $1.8 million after the associated tax benefit). Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Net Revenues For fiscal 2016, net revenues decreased $6.4 million, or 1.3%, to $502.6 million, from $509.0 million for fiscal 2015. Direct. For fiscal 2016, net revenues increased $15.7 million, or 4.7%, to $351.3 million, from $335.6 million for fiscal 2015. This change resulted from a $51.3 million contribution of revenue from our non-comparable stores, which included 26 additional stores in the current year, partially offset by a comparable sales decrease of $33.7 million, or 10.6% and a gift card breakage revenue decrease of $1.1 million. Fiscal 2015 was the first year gift card breakage revenue was recognized; refer to Note 2, herein, for additional information. The decrease in comparable sales includes a 13.2% decrease in e-commerce sales and an 8.6% decrease in comparable store sales, primarily as a result of reduced traffic. There was also a decrease in sales at our annual outlet sale compared to the prior fiscal year. We believe the year-over-year traffic declines in e-commerce and stores are due, at least in part, to our intentional reduction of promotional activity. The aggregate number of full-line and factory outlet stores grew from 125 at the end of fiscal 2015, to 150 at the end of fiscal 2016, which includes the closure of one full-line store in fiscal 2016. Indirect. For fiscal 2016, net revenues decreased $22.1 million, or 12.7%, to $151.3 million, from $173.4 million for fiscal 2015, primarily due to lower orders from specialty retail accounts, as well as a reduction in the number of specialty retailers. Gross Profit For fiscal 2016, gross profit increased $12.2 million, or 4.5%, to $281.2 million, from $269.0 million for fiscal 2015. As a percentage of net revenues, gross profit increased to 55.9% for fiscal 2016, from 52.9% for fiscal 2015. The year-over-year increase in the gross margin rate was primarily related to sourcing efficiencies (lower product costs combined with Fall 2014 cost reductions at the Company domestic manufacturing facility as well as leverage of overhead costs resulting from an increase in units manufactured), increased sales penetration of higher-margin made-for-outlet products, reduced promotional activity and lower levels of liquidation sales. Gross profit during fiscal 2016 was impacted by restructuring charges of $3.4 million related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, as discussed in more detail in Note 15 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. 39 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A) For fiscal 2016, SG&A expenses increased $28.1 million, or 13.5%, to $236.8 million, from $208.7 million for fiscal 2015. As a percentage of net revenues, SG&A expenses were 47.1% and 41.0% for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. The increase in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2016 included $1.3 million in employee severance expense and $1.2 million in expense related to a retail store early termination agreement that did not occur in the comparable prior year period. The remaining increase was primarily due to investments in new stores, $6.0 million in incremental marketing and advertising, $2.7 million in additional incentive compensation, as well as $2.3 million in incremental store impairment charges. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to the aforementioned items, as well as fixed expenses being spread over lower revenues and deleveraging of store operating expenses as a result of lower comparable store sales. Other Income For fiscal 2016, other income decreased $1.3 million, or 36.6%, to $2.4 million from $3.7 million for fiscal 2015, primarily due to a decrease in participation in the co-op mailer program. Operating Income For fiscal 2016, operating income decreased $17.4 million, or 27.1%, to $46.7 million, from $64.1 million for fiscal 2015. As a percentage of net revenues, operating income was 9.3% and 12.6% for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. Operating income for fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by the $5.9 million in restructuring and other charges described above under Gross Profit and Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. The remaining decrease in operating income was due to an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses and a decrease in other income, partially offset by an increase in gross profit, as described above. The following table provides additional information about our operating income (in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended $ Change % Change January 30, 2016 January 31, 2015 Operating Income: Direct $ 74,114 $ 74,099 $ 15 % Indirect 60,409 66,213 (5,804 ) (8.8 )% Less: Unallocated corporate expenses (87,801 ) (76,242 ) (11,559 ) 15.2 % Operating income $ 46,722 $ 64,070 $ (17,348 ) (27.1 )% Direct . For fiscal 2016, the change in operating income was essentially flat. As a percentage of Direct segment net revenues, operating income in the Direct segment was 21.1% and 22.1% for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Operating income for fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by the $3.5 million, or 1.0% as a percentage of Direct segment net revenues, in restructuring and other charges related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and a retail store early termination agreement. Indirect . For fiscal 2016, operating income decreased $5.8 million, or 8.8%. As a percentage of Indirect segment net revenues, operating income in the Indirect segment was 39.9% and 38.2% for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in operating income as a percentage of Indirect segment net revenues was primarily due to an increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, as described above. This increase was partially offset by $1.1 million, or 0.8% as a percentage of Indirect segment net revenues, in restructuring charges related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Corporate Unallocated . For fiscal 2016, unallocated expenses increased $11.6 million, or 15.2%. The increase in unallocated expenses included $1.3 million in employee severance expense. The remaining increase was primarily due to incremental marketing and advertising investments, an increase in incentive compensation due to Company performance, as well as an increase in depreciation expense primarily as a result of the campus consolidation. Interest Expense, Net. For fiscal 2016, net interest expense decreased $0.1 million, or 35.4%, to $0.3 million, from $0.4 million in fiscal 2015. 40 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense. For fiscal 2016, we recorded income tax expense of $18.9 million at an effective tax rate of 40.7%, compared to 35.9% for fiscal 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to decreases to tax expense in fiscal 2015 that did not occur in fiscal 2016, as well as increases in permanent tax exclusions in fiscal 2016 including an increase in income tax reserves for uncertain federal and state tax positions related to research and development tax credits from prior years. Fiscal 2016 included $0.6 million of income tax reserves for uncertain tax positions related to research and development tax credits. Income from Continuing Operations For fiscal 2016, income from continuing operations decreased $13.2 million, or 32.5%, to $27.6 million from $40.8 million in fiscal 2015. Included in this decrease were restructuring and other charges of $5.2 million ($3.4 million after the associated tax benefit), as described in Note 15 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, in addition to $1.3 million in employee severance ($0.8 million after the associated tax benefit). Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes For fiscal 2015, loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes was $2.4 million reflecting the exit of the direct Japan business in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Net Income For fiscal 2016, net income decreased $10.8 million, or 28.3%, to $27.6 million from $38.4 million in fiscal 2015. Included in this decrease were restructuring and other charges of $5.2 million ($3.4 million after the associated tax benefit), as described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, in addition to $1.3 million in employee severance ($0.8 million after the associated tax benefit). Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. We also have access to additional liquidity, if needed, through availability under our $125.0 million second amended and restated credit agreement. Historically, our primary cash needs have been for merchandise inventories; payroll; store rent; capital expenditures associated with operational equipment, buildings, information technology, opening new stores; share repurchases; and debt repayments. The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, merchandise inventories, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current liabilities. We believe that cash on hand and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities, short-term investments, and the availability of borrowings under our second amended and restated credit agreement or other financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, share repurchases, and debt payments for the foreseeable future. Short-Term Investments Short-term investments consist of a certificate of deposit with an original maturity of one year and a one-time option to accelerate maturity to 31 days without penalty. Interest income from the investment is included in interest expense, net, in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our objective with respect to this investment is to earn a higher rate of return, relative to deposit accounts, on funds that are otherwise not anticipated to be required to meet liquidity needs in the near term while maintaining a low level of investment risk. We have the intent and ability to hold this investment to maturity. Cash Flow Analysis A summary of operating, investing, and financing activities is shown in the following table (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2017 January 30, 2016 January 31, 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 65,186 $ 43,270 $ 103,812 Net cash used in investing activities (50,770 ) (26,322 ) (37,128 ) Net cash used in financing activities (25,715 ) (31,531 ) (13,604 ) 41 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation, the effect of changes in assets and liabilities, and tenant-improvement allowances received from landlords under our store leases. Net cash provided by operating activities was $65.2 million during fiscal 2017 , as compared to $43.3 million during fiscal 2016 . The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of the timing of inventory receipts in the current-year period, which resulted in a source of cash for the current-year period of $11.3 million , as compared to an inventory build in the comparable prior-year period for made-for-outlet product, which resulted in a use of cash of $15.2 million in the comparable prior-year period. In addition, accounts payable resulted in a source of cash for the current-year period of $9.0 million , as compared to a use of cash of $8.7 million in the comparable prior-year period, primarily due to the timing of inventory payments. These sources of cash were partially offset by a change in income taxes which resulted in a use of cash of $12.0 million in the current-year period as compared to a source of cash of $12.5 million in the comparable prior-year period. The income tax change was primarily a result of the timing of an $11.5 million federal income tax payment in the current-year period, as well as incremental payments as a result of increased income at certain points in time during the current year. In the comparable prior-year period, net income included cash payments of approximately $2.6 million for restructuring activities related to the closure of our domestic manufacturing facility which did not recur in the current period. These payments consisted of $1.7 million for severance and benefits, $0.7 million for a lease termination and $0.2 million in other associated costs. Net cash provided by operating activities was $43.3 million during fiscal 2016, as compared to $103.8 million during fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in net income of $10.9 million and changes in assets and liabilities which provided an $8.8 million use of cash as compared to a $45.3 million source of cash in the prior year, primarily as a result of inventories, accounts payable and income taxes. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Investing activities consist primarily of short-term investments and capital expenditures for growth related to new store openings, buildings, operational equipment, and information technology investments. Net cash used in investing activities was $50.8 million in fiscal 2017 , compared to $26.3 million in fiscal 2016 . The increase in cash used in investing activities was due to a $30.0 million short-term investment in a certificate of deposit made in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, partially offset by a decrease in property, plant, and equipment spending compared to the prior-year period. The decrease in property, plant, and equipment spending was primarily a result of ten new stores opened in the current-year period as compared to 26 stores in the comparable prior-year period, as well as spending for the campus consolidation in the prior-year period which did not recur in the current-year period, partially offset by an increase in information technology investments, including spending for our e-commerce platform upgrade. Net cash used in investing activities was $26.3 million in fiscal 2016, compared to $37.1 million in fiscal 2015. The $10.8 million decrease in capital expenditures was driven primarily by the campus consolidation which was substantially completed in fiscal 2015. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $10.0 million to $15.0 million . Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $25.7 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $31.5 million in fiscal 2016 . The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to $25.0 million of cash purchases of our common stock under the 2015 Share Repurchase Plan in the current-year period compared to $30.9 million of cash purchases of our common stock under the 2015 and 2014 Share Repurchase Plans in the prior-year period. Net cash used in financing activities was $31.5 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $13.6 million in fiscal 2015. The $17.9 million increase in financing activities was primarily due to the completion of purchases of shares of the Company's common stock made under the 2014 Share Repurchase Program, as well as purchases under the 2015 Share Repurchase Program. Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On July 15, 2015, Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. ( VBD ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement among VBD, the lenders from time to time party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as syndication agent, and KeyBank National Association, as documentation agent (the Credit Agreement ), which amended and restated our prior credit 42 Table of Contents agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for certain credit facilities to VBD in an aggregate principal amount not to initially exceed $125.0 million, the proceeds of which will be used for general corporate purposes of VBD and its subsidiaries, including but not limited to Vera Bradley International, LLC and Vera Bradley Sales, LLC (collectively, the Named Subsidiaries ). Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at VBD's option, at a per annum rate equal to either (A) the Alternate Base Rate ( ABR ) plus the Applicable Margin, where the ABR is the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) Adjusted LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1%, and the Applicable Margin is a percentage ranging from 0.00% to 0.70% depending upon the Company's leverage ratio or (B) Adjusted LIBOR plus the Applicable Margin, where Adjusted LIBOR means LIBOR, as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities, and Applicable Margin is a percentage ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% depending upon the Company's leverage ratio. Any loans made, or letters of credit issued, pursuant to the Credit Agreement mature on July 15, 2020. As of January 28, 2017 , the Company had no borrowings and availability of $125.0 million under the agreement. VBD's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and the Named Subsidiaries. The obligations of VBD under the Credit Agreement are secured by first priority security interests in all of the respective assets of VBD, the Company, and the Named Subsidiaries and a pledge of the equity interests of VBD and the Named Subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement contains various restrictive covenants, including restrictions on the Company's ability to dispose of assets, make acquisitions or investments, incur debt or liens, make distributions to stockholders or repurchase outstanding stock, enter into related party transactions and make capital expenditures, other than upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Company is also required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum ratio of EBITDAR to the sum of interest expense plus rentals (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and a limit on capital expenditures. Upon an event of default, which includes certain customary events such as, among other things, a failure to make required payments when due, a failure to comply with covenants, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, a material adverse change (as defined in the Credit Agreement), defaults under other material indebtedness, and a change in control, the lenders may accelerate amounts outstanding, terminate the agreement and foreclose on all collateral. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of January 28, 2017 . Contractual Obligations We enter into long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily non-cancellable operating leases. As of January 28, 2017 , our contractual cash obligations over the next several periods are as follows: Payments Due by Period (3) ($ in thousands) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More Than 5 Years Operating leases (1) $ 222,150 $ 32,681 $ 62,098 $ 57,316 $ 70,055 Purchase obligations (2) 54,049 54,049 Total $ 276,199 $ 86,730 $ 62,098 $ 57,316 $ 70,055 (1) Our store leases are generally ten years with varying renewal options. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we were to extend these leases, or if we were to enter into new operating leases. (2) Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases. (3) Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our uncertain tax positions at January 28, 2017 , we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $0.9 million of uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosures relating to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our accounting policies, estimates, and judgments on an on-going basis. We base our 43 Table of Contents estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We evaluate the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and believe that the following policies and estimates involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position, and are therefore discussed as critical. The following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent results of operations. Our historical results for the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, however, have not been materially impacted by such variances. More information on all of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of our products is recognized upon customer receipt of the product when collection of the associated receivables is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, which, for e-commerce and most Indirect sales, reflects an estimate of shipments that customers have not yet received. The adjustment of these shipments is based on actual delivery dates to the customer. Significant changes in shipping terms or delivery times could materially impact our revenues in a given period. We reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. In the Direct business, returns are refunded by issuing the same payment tender of the original purchase and in the Indirect business the customer is issued a credit to its account to apply to outstanding invoices. Merchandise exchanges of the same product at the same price are not considered merchandise returns. Product returns are often resalable through our annual outlet sale or other channels. Additionally, we reserve for other potential product credits and for customer shipments not yet received. The balance of the reserve for returns, customer shipments not yet received, and general credits was $6.2 million and $3.3 million as of January 28, 2017 , and January 30, 2016 , respectively. We sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers and do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards. Gift cards that we issue are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed, at which point revenue is recognized. In addition, we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions. We determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. During the fiscal years ended January 28, 2017 , January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , the Company recorded $0.3 million , $0.3 million and $1.4 million of revenue related to gift card breakage, respectively. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method. Market is determined based on net realizable value, which includes costs to dispose. Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excess quantities, and other factors, including the popularity of a pattern or product, in evaluating net realizable value. We record valuation adjustments to our inventories, which are reflected in cost of sales, if the cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. This adjustment calculation requires us to make assumptions and estimates, which are based on factors such as merchandise seasonality, historical trends, and estimated sales and inventory levels, including sell-through of remaining units. In addition, as part of inventory adjustments, we provide for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from our physical inventory counts. We perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrinkage provision accordingly. The balance of inventory adjustments was $2.6 million and $5.5 million for these matters as of the fiscal years ended January 28, 2017 , and January 30, 2016 , respectively. These adjustments related primarily to raw materials of retired patterns and styles and merchandise from the baby gift category, which was discontinued by the Company, and technology accessories. The reduction in inventory adjustments primarily related to the destruction of certain raw materials and finished goods no longer needed or deemed salable, as well as the sell-through of retired finished goods. We have the ability to move retired finished goods through a number of channels, including the annual outlet sale, our website and factory outlet stores, and through third-party liquidators as needed. 44 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is based on our pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained; (2) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. Taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns. We believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable. Taxing authorities, however, may take a contrary position. Our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if, upon final resolution with taxing authorities, we prevail in positions for which we have established reserves, or are required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. The balance of the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) was $0.9 million , $3.1 million and $3.0 million as of January 28, 2017 , January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , respectively. A benefit of $1.9 million , an expense of $0.1 million and a benefit of $0.1 million was recognized in income tax expense for these matters during the fiscal years ended January 28, 2017 , January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , respectively. Valuation of Long-lived Assets Property, plant, and equipment assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In evaluating an asset for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset at the store level, the lowest identifiable level of cash flow, if applicable. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset is less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, usually determined by an estimated discounted cash flow analysis of the asset. Factors used in the valuation of long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, our plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results, and projected future cash flows. With respect to our stores, we analyze store economics, location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies in our selection process. Impairment charges are classified in SG&A expenses and were $12.7 million , $2.8 million and $0.4 million for the periods ended January 28, 2017 , January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , respectively. The discounted cash flow models used to estimate the applicable fair values involve numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective. Changes to these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the fair value estimates. The estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include: (1) estimated future cash flow generated at the store level; and (2) discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair values. These and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and our expectations and may change in the future based on period-specific facts and circumstances. If economic conditions were to deteriorate, future impairment charges may be required.
