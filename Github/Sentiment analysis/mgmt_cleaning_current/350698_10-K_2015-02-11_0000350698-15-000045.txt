ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Part I, including matters set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10-K, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Except to the extent that differences among reportable segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole, we present the discussion in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on a consolidated basis. Overview AutoNation, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. As of December 31, 2014 , we owned and operated 276 new vehicle franchises from 232 stores located in the United States, predominantly in major metropolitan markets in the Sunbelt region. Our stores, which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets, sell 34 different new vehicle brands. The core brands of new vehicles that we sell, representing approximately 95% of the new vehicles that we sold in 2014 , are manufactured by Toyota, Ford, Honda, Nissan, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, Chrysler, BMW, and Volkswagen . We offer a diversified range of automotive products and services, including new vehicles, used vehicles, parts and service, which includes automotive repair and maintenance services as well as wholesale parts and collision businesses, and automotive finance and insurance products, which include vehicle service and other protection products, as well as the arranging of financing for vehicle purchases through third-party finance sources. As of December 31, 2014 , we had three reportable segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. Our Domestic segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. Our Import segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan. Our Premium Luxury segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Lexus. The franchises in each segment also sell used vehicles, parts and automotive repair and maintenance services, and automotive finance and insurance products. For the year ended December 31, 2014 , new vehicle sales accounted for approximately 57% of our total revenue, but approximately 22% of our total gross profit. Used vehicle sales accounted for approximately 23% of our total revenue, and approximately 12% of our total gross profit. Our parts and service and finance and insurance operations, while comprising approximately 19% of total revenue, contributed approximately 65% of our gross profit. Results of Operations We had net income from continuing operations of $419.8 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.53 in 2014 , as compared to net income from continuing operations of $375.8 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.05 in 2013 , and net income from continuing operations of $317.3 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.52 in 2012 . The 2014 results were impacted by a net gain related to business/property dispositions of $8.1 million ($5.0 million after-tax), primarily related to the divestiture of our customer lead distribution business. The 2013 results were impacted by a net gain related to property dispositions of $7.2 million ($4.5 million after-tax), and a favorable tax adjustment of $3.4 million . The 2012 results were impacted by a non-cash franchise rights impairment charge of $4.2 million ($2.6 million after-tax). Market Conditions Full-year U.S. industry new vehicle unit sales were 16.5 million in 2014 , as compared to 15.6 million in 2013 and 14.5 million in 2012 . In 2014 , new vehicle industry sales were driven in part by replacement demand. Based on industry data, the average age of cars and trucks in the United States is at a record high of 11.4 years compared to an average age of 9.8 years during the period from 2002 to 2007. Attractive products and continued access to affordable credit were also 22 Table of Contents supportive of a strong selling environment. We expect continued growth in new vehicle unit sales in 2015, with full-year U.S. industry new vehicle unit sales above 17 million. However, actual sales may materially differ. During 2014, the warranty component of our parts and service business benefited from the rise of manufacturer recalls in our Domestic and Import segment. Additionally, after several years of decline, the number of recent-model-year vehicles in operation has begun to grow due to increases in the annual rate of new vehicle sales in the United States since 2009. The growth in that portion of our service base, together with our customer retention efforts, has benefited the customer-pay service and warranty components of our parts and service business, and we believe that it will continue to benefit those components for the next several years. While the number of older vehicles in operation is expected to decline over the next few years, we believe that overall our parts and service business will benefit from the mix shift in our service base toward newer vehicles. Inventory Management Our new and used vehicle inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We monitor our vehicle inventory levels closely based on current economic conditions and seasonal sales trends. We have generally not experienced losses on the sale of new vehicle inventory, in part due to incentives provided by manufacturers to promote sales of new vehicles and our inventory management practices. We had 67,424 units in new vehicle inventory at December 31, 2014 , and 72,095 units at December 31, 2013 . We recondition the majority of used vehicles acquired for retail sale in our parts and service departments and capitalize the related costs to the used vehicle inventory. Used vehicles that are not sold on a retail basis are generally liquidated at wholesale auctions. We record estimated losses on used vehicle inventory. Our used vehicle inventory balance was net of cumulative write-downs of $3.3 million at December 31, 2014 , and $1.8 million at December 31, 2013 . Parts, accessories, and other inventory are carried at the lower of acquisition cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. We estimate the amount of potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience and market trends. Our parts, accessories, and other inventory balance was net of cumulative write-downs of $3.5 million at December 31, 2014 , and $3.6 million at December 31, 2013 . Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations, based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application. Goodwill Goodwill for our Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury reporting units is tested for impairment annually on April 30 or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Under accounting standards, we chose to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it was necessary to calculate the fair values of our reporting units under the two-step goodwill impairment test. We completed our qualitative assessment of potential goodwill impairment as of April 30, 2014 , and we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were less than their carrying amounts. As of December 31, 2014 , we have $175.1 million of goodwill related to the Domestic reporting unit, $551.6 million related to the Import reporting unit, and $588.0 million related to the Premium Luxury reporting unit. 23 Table of Contents Other Intangible Assets Our principal identifiable intangible assets are individual store rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers, which have indefinite lives and are tested for impairment annually on April 30 or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Under accounting standards, we chose to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of franchise rights impairment to determine whether it was necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. We completed our qualitative assessment of franchise rights impairment as of April 30, 2014 . Based on our qualitative assessment, we determined that we should perform a quantitative test for franchise rights related to one store, and no impairment charges resulted from this quantitative test. For the remainder of our franchise rights, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of our franchise rights were less than their carrying amounts. The quantitative impairment test for intangibles with indefinite lives is dependent on many variables used to determine the fair value of our franchise rights. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on how fair value measurements are derived for our franchise rights for the quantitative impairment test. Long-Lived Assets We estimate the depreciable lives of our property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and review them for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired. Such events or changes may include a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, a current expectation that more-likely-than-not a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses. When evaluating potential impairment of long-lived assets held and used, we first compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, we then compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group estimated fair value to determine if impairment exists. The fair value measurements for our long-lived assets held and used were based on Level 3 inputs, which considered information obtained from third-party real estate valuation sources. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our fair value measurements. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset group carrying amount exceeds the asset group estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset group becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset. During 2014 , there were no significant impairment charges recorded for the carrying value of long-lived assets held and used in continuing operations. When property and equipment is identified as held for sale, we reclassify the held for sale assets to Other Current Assets and cease recording depreciation. We measure each long-lived asset or disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and recognize a loss for any initial adjustment of the long-lived asset or disposal group carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell in the period the held for sale criteria are met. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if, based on market conditions, the values of these assets should be adjusted. Any subsequent change in the fair value less cost to sell (increase or decrease) of each asset held for sale is reported as an adjustment to its carrying amount, except that the adjusted carrying amount cannot exceed the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. Such valuations include estimations of fair values and incremental direct costs to transact a sale. The fair value measurements for our long-lived assets held for sale were based on Level 3 inputs, which considered information obtained from third-party real estate valuation sources, or, in certain cases, pending agreements to sell the related assets. We had assets held for sale in continuing operations of $64.7 million at December 31, 2014 , and $59.8 million at December 31, 2013 . We recorded impairment charges of $1.1 million in 2014 associated with assets held for sale in continuing operations. 24 Table of Contents We had assets held for sale in discontinued operations of $23.2 million at December 31, 2014 , and $34.5 million at December 31, 2013 . During 2014 , there were no significant impairment charges associated with assets held for sale in discontinued operations. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future undiscounted cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets. Although we believe our property and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued, the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets. Chargeback Reserve Revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for: (i) loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed, (ii) vehicle service contracts sold, and (iii) other protection products sold. We primarily sell these products on a straight commission basis; however we also participate in future underwriting profit on certain extended service contracts pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements, which are recognized as earned. We may be charged back for commissions related to financing, vehicle service contracts, or other protection products in the event of early termination, default, or prepayment of the contracts by customers ( chargebacks ). However, our exposure to loss generally is limited to the commissions that we receive. These commissions are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles, net of an estimated liability for chargebacks. We estimate our liability for chargebacks on an individual product basis using our historical chargeback experience, based primarily on cancellation data we receive from third parties that sell and administer these products. Our estimated liability for chargebacks totaled $84.9 million at December 31, 2014 , and $67.6 million at December 31, 2013 . Chargebacks are influenced by the volume of vehicle sales in recent years and increases or decreases in early termination rates resulting from cancellation of vehicle service contracts and other protection products, defaults, refinancings, payoffs before maturity, and other factors. While we consider these factors in the estimation of our chargeback liability, actual events may differ from our estimates, which could result in a change in our estimated liability for chargebacks. The increase in our liability for chargebacks is largely attributable to an increase in sales of vehicle service contracts in recent years, which have higher cancellation rates compared to other products, as well as an overall increase in the cancellation rate of finance and insurance products. Our actual chargeback experience has not been materially different from our recorded estimates. A 10% change in our estimated cancellation rates would have changed our estimated liability for chargebacks at December 31, 2014 , by approximately $8.5 million . See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding chargeback liabilities. Self Insurance Reserves Under our self insurance programs, we retain various levels of aggregate loss limits, per claim deductibles, and claims-handling expenses as part of our various insurance programs, including property and casualty, employee medical benefits, automobile, and workers compensation. Costs in excess of this retained risk per claim may be insured under various contracts with third-party insurance carriers. We review our claim and loss history on a periodic basis to assist in assessing our future liability. The ultimate costs of these retained insurance risks are estimated by management and by third-party actuarial evaluation of historical claims experience, adjusted for current trends and changes in claims-handling procedures. Our results could be materially impacted by claims and other expenses related to our self insurance programs if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Self insurance reserves totaled $71.4 million at December 31, 2014 , and $66.3 million at December 31, 2013 . We believe our actual loss experience has not been materially different from our recorded estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles, sales of parts and services, commissions from finance and insurance products, and sales of other products. We recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided. We recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed, the vehicle has been delivered, and payment has been received or financing has been arranged. Rebates, holdbacks, floorplan assistance, and certain other incentives received from manufacturers are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the vehicle 25 Table of Contents and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program, whichever is later. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding revenue recognition. Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We regularly evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and provide valuation allowances to offset portions of deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding the future realization of such deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax-planning strategies. We adjust the valuation allowance in the period we determine it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will not be realized. If a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be adjusted in the period when the change in circumstances occurs. Accounting for our income taxes also requires significant judgment in the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and in the calculation of our provision for income taxes. Accounting standards prescribe a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate available evidence to determine if it appears more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained on an audit by a taxing authority, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settling the uncertain tax position. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, the ultimate outcome of these tax matters may differ from our expectations. We adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the completion of a tax audit, expiration of a statute of limitations, the refinement of an estimate, and interest accruals associated with uncertain tax positions until they are resolved. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our deferred tax assets or liabilities, the valuation of our uncertain tax positions, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. Other Additionally, estimates have been made by us in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements including allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals related to certain legal proceedings, and certain assumptions related to determining stock-based compensation. 26 Table of Contents Reported Operating Data Years Ended December 31, ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 2014 2013 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance 2012 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance Revenue: New vehicle $ 10,972.2 $ 9,949.6 $ 1,022.6 10.3 $ 8,906.2 $ 1,043.4 11.7 Retail used vehicle 3,988.9 3,697.9 291.0 7.9 3,230.0 467.9 14.5 Wholesale 396.8 429.5 (32.7 ) (7.6 ) 484.3 (54.8 ) (11.3 ) Used vehicle 4,385.7 4,127.4 258.3 6.3 3,714.3 413.1 11.1 Finance and insurance, net 750.8 674.0 76.8 11.4 571.2 102.8 18.0 Total variable operations (1) 16,108.7 14,751.0 1,357.7 9.2 13,191.7 1,559.3 11.8 Parts and service 2,822.5 2,597.4 225.1 8.7 2,399.2 198.2 8.3 Other 177.6 169.2 8.4 76.6 92.6 Total revenue $ 19,108.8 $ 17,517.6 $ 1,591.2 9.1 $ 15,667.5 $ 1,850.1 11.8 Gross profit: New vehicle $ 650.1 $ 616.4 $ 33.7 5.5 $ 579.5 $ 36.9 6.4 Retail used vehicle 363.2 325.2 38.0 11.7 293.7 31.5 10.7 Wholesale (2.6 ) 4.5 (7.1 ) 5.5 (1.0 ) Used vehicle 360.6 329.7 30.9 9.4 299.2 30.5 10.2 Finance and insurance 750.8 674.0 76.8 11.4 571.2 102.8 18.0 Total variable operations (1) 1,761.5 1,620.1 141.4 8.7 1,449.9 170.2 11.7 Parts and service 1,196.6 1,105.8 90.8 8.2 1,008.0 97.8 9.7 Other 30.6 34.0 (3.4 ) 28.3 5.7 Total gross profit 2,988.7 2,759.9 228.8 8.3 2,486.2 273.7 11.0 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 2,079.6 1,935.0 (144.6 ) (7.5 ) 1,749.3 (185.7 ) (10.6 ) Depreciation and amortization 106.9 95.3 (11.6 ) 87.3 (8.0 ) Franchise rights impairment 4.2 4.2 Other expenses (income), net (18.6 ) (10.7 ) 7.9 0.1 10.8 Operating income 820.8 740.3 80.5 10.9 645.3 95.0 14.7 Non-operating income (expense) items: Floorplan interest expense (53.3 ) (53.4 ) 0.1 (45.5 ) (7.9 ) Other interest expense (86.7 ) (88.3 ) 1.6 (86.9 ) (1.4 ) Loss on debt extinguishment (1.6 ) (1.6 ) Interest income 0.2 0.2 0.3 (0.1 ) Other income, net 2.9 5.6 (2.7 ) 3.6 2.0 Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 682.3 $ 604.4 $ 77.9 12.9 $ 516.8 $ 87.6 17.0 Retail vehicle unit sales: New vehicle 318,008 292,922 25,086 8.6 267,784 25,138 9.4 Used vehicle 214,910 204,572 10,338 5.1 180,955 23,617 13.1 532,918 497,494 35,424 7.1 448,739 48,755 10.9 Revenue per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 34,503 $ 33,967 $ 536 1.6 $ 33,259 $ 708 2.1 Used vehicle $ 18,561 $ 18,076 $ 485 2.7 $ 17,850 $ 226 1.3 Gross profit per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 2,044 $ 2,104 $ (60 ) (2.9 ) $ 2,164 $ (60 ) (2.8 ) Used vehicle $ 1,690 $ 1,590 $ 100 6.3 $ 1,623 $ (33 ) (2.0 ) Finance and insurance $ 1,409 $ 1,355 $ 54 4.0 $ 1,273 $ 82 6.4 Total variable operations (2) $ 3,310 $ 3,247 $ 63 1.9 $ 3,219 $ 28 0.9 (1) Total variable operations includes new vehicle, used vehicle (retail and wholesale), and finance and insurance results.

New vehicle unit volume also benefited from the acquisition we completed in the fourth quarter of 2012. Domestic segment income increased during 2013, as compared to 2012, primarily due to an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit, which benefited from an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed and higher new and used vehicle unit volume. Domestic segment income also benefited from increases in new and used vehicle gross profit and parts and service gross profit, and from the acquisition noted in the paragraph above. Increases in Domestic segment income were partially offset by an increase in variable expenses. 38 Table of Contents Import The Import segment operating results included the following: Years Ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2014 2013 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance 2012 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance Revenue $ 6,717.8 $ 6,375.0 $ 342.8 5.4 $ 5,827.5 $ 547.5 9.4 Segment income $ 291.3 $ 280.1 $ 11.2 4.0 $ 257.9 $ 22.2 8.6 Retail new vehicle unit sales 154,066 143,325 10,741 7.5 133,912 9,413 7.0 2014 compared to 2013 Import revenue increased during 2014 , as compared to 2013 , primarily due to an increase in new vehicle unit volume.

The following table presents the major components of our SG&A. Years Ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2014 2013 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance 2012 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance Reported: Compensation $ 1,362.5 $ 1,252.9 $ (109.6 ) (8.7 ) $ 1,137.3 $ (115.6 ) (10.2 ) Advertising 164.9 166.4 1.5 0.9 135.7 (30.7 ) (22.6 ) Store and corporate overhead 552.2 515.7 (36.5 ) (7.1 ) 476.3 (39.4 ) (8.3 ) Total $ 2,079.6 $ 1,935.0 $ (144.6 ) (7.5 ) $ 1,749.3 $ (185.7 ) (10.6 ) SG&A as a % of total gross profit: Compensation 45.6 45.4 (20 ) bps 45.7 30 bps Advertising 5.5 6.0 50 bps 5.5 (50 ) bps Store and corporate overhead 18.5 18.7 20 bps 19.2 50 bps Total 69.6 70.1 50 bps 70.4 30 bps 2014 compared to 2013 SG&A expenses increased in 2014 , as compared to 2013 , primarily due to a performance-driven increase in compensation expense, an increase in store and corporate overhead expenses, and an increase in gross advertising expenditures excluding the impact of expenses incurred in 2013 related to our re-branding initiative noted below. As a percentage of total gross profit, SG&A expenses decreased to 69.6% in 2014 from 70.1% in 2013 resulting from our continued effective management of our cost structure and improved gross profit. 2013 compared to 2012 SG&A expenses increased in 2013 , as compared to 2012 , primarily due to a performance-driven increase in compensation expense and increases in gross advertising expenditures and store and corporate overhead expenses. As a percentage of total gross profit, SG&A expenses decreased to 70.1% in 2013 from 70.4% in 2012 resulting from our continued effective management of our cost structure, improved associate productivity, and improved gross profit, partially offset by an increase in expenses resulting from our re-branding initiative noted below. Strategic Initiatives We have invested and will continue to invest significantly in the AutoNation retail brand with the goals of enhancing our strong customer satisfaction and expanding our market share. In 2013, we incurred non-recurring SG&A expenses of approximately $18 million, primarily comprised of advertising expenses, related to the re-branding of our Domestic and Import stores under the AutoNation retail brand. We are also investing significantly to build a seamless, end-to-end customer experience in our stores and through our digital channels, as well as to improve our ability to generate business through those channels. A portion of the expenses associated with these strategic initiatives have been and will be capitalized and amortized over future periods. Operating Expenses (Income), Net During 2014, we recognized a gain related to the divestiture of two Import stores of $4.4 million ($2.7 million after-tax), a gain related to a legal settlement of $4.0 million ($2.5 million after-tax), and a net gain related to business/property 41 Table of Contents dispositions of $8.1 million ($5.0 million after-tax), primarily related to the divestiture of our customer lead distribution business. During 2013, we recognized a net gain related to property dispositions of $7.2 million ($4.5 million after-tax). Non-Operating Income (Expenses) Floorplan Interest Expense Floorplan interest expense was $53.3 million in 2014 , $53.4 million in 2013 , and $45.5 million in 2012 . Floorplan interest expense in 2014 was relatively flat compared to 2013. The increase in floorplan interest expense of $7.9 million in 2013 , as compared to 2012 , was primarily the result of higher average vehicle floorplan balances, partially offset by lower negotiated floorplan interest rates. Other Interest Expense Other interest expense was incurred primarily on borrowings under our outstanding senior unsecured notes, credit agreement, and mortgage facility. Other interest expense in 2014 was relatively flat compared to 2013 and 2012 . Loss on Debt Extinguishment We expensed $1.6 million pre-tax in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to a debt refinancing transaction. This expense included $0.4 million for the write-off of previously deferred debt issuance costs. See Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Refinancing Transaction below. Provision for Income Taxes Income taxes are provided based upon our anticipated underlying annual blended federal and state income tax rates, adjusted, as necessary, for any other tax matters occurring during the period. As we operate in various states, our effective tax rate is also dependent upon our geographic revenue mix. Our effective income tax rate was 38.5% in 2014 . See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our unrecognized tax benefits. We do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease during the twelve months beginning January 1, 2015 . Our effective income tax rate was 37.8% in 2013 , which reflected the benefit of certain favorable tax adjustments. During 2013, we completed a restructuring of certain of our subsidiaries, a consequence of which was the release of a valuation allowance of $3.4 million , which was reflected as a benefit in our income tax provision in 2013. Our effective income tax rate was 38.6% in 2012 . Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations are related to stores that were sold or terminated prior to January 1, 2014. Results from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, were primarily related to carrying costs for real estate we have not yet sold associated with stores that were closed prior to January 1, 2014, and other adjustments related to disposed operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources We manage our liquidity to ensure access to sufficient funding at acceptable costs to fund our ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures while continuing to meet our financial obligations. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, funds generated through future operations, and amounts available under our revolving credit facility and secured used vehicle floorplan facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, service our debt, pay our tax obligations and commitments and contingencies, and meet any seasonal operating requirements for the foreseeable future. Debt Refinancing Transaction On December 3, 2014, we amended and restated our existing unsecured credit agreement (as amended and restated, our credit agreement ). The credit agreement amendment, among other things, (1) replaced our $500.0 million term loan facility and $1.2 billion revolving credit facility under our prior credit agreement with a $1.8 billion revolving credit facility, (2) provided lower commitment fees and loan margins as set forth in the credit agreement, (3) increased the 42 Table of Contents maximum capitalization ratio from 65.0% to 70.0% and (4) extended the stated termination date to December 3, 2019. See Long-Term Debt - Credit Agreement and Long-Term Debt - Restrictions and Covenants below for additional information regarding our credit agreement and our financial covenants. The indebtedness outstanding under the prior credit agreement was paid off with proceeds from our amended credit agreement. Available Liquidity Resources We had the following sources of liquidity available for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 : (In millions) December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 75.4 $ 69.2 Revolving Credit Facility (1) $ 644.4 $ 854.4 Secured Used Floorplan Facilities (2) $ 50.2 $ 50.0 (1) Based on aggregate borrowings outstanding of $1.1 billion and outstanding letters of credit of $45.6 million at December 31, 2014 , and aggregate borrowings outstanding of $300.0 million and outstanding letters of credit of $45.6 million at December 31, 2013 . See Long-Term Debt Credit Agreement for additional information. (2) Based on the eligible used vehicle inventory that could have been pledged as collateral. See Long-Term Debt Vehicle Floorplan Payable for additional information. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and/or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2014 , surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash deposits totaled $93.7 million , including the $45.6 million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. In February 2014, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC that enables us to offer for sale, from time to time and as the capital markets permit, an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities, warrants, subscription rights, depositary shares or stock purchase contracts, as well as units that include any of those securities. Capital Allocation Our capital allocation strategy is focused on maximizing stockholder returns. The first priority of our capital allocation strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet. Second, we invest capital in our business to maintain and upgrade our existing facilities and to build new facilities, as well as for other strategic and technology initiatives. Third, we deploy capital opportunistically to repurchase our common stock and/or debt or to complete dealership acquisitions and/or build facilities for newly awarded franchises. Our capital allocation decisions will be based on factors such as the expected rate of return on our investment, the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value, the market price of our debt, the potential impact on our capital structure, our ability to complete dealership acquisitions that meet our market and vehicle brand criteria and return on investment threshold, and limitations set forth in our debt agreements. Share Repurchases A summary of shares repurchased under our share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors follows: (In millions, except per share data) 2014 2013 2012 Shares repurchased 9.4 1.1 16.6 Aggregate purchase price $ 485.1 $ 53.5 $ 580.6 Average purchase price per share $ 51.59 $ 47.37 $ 34.89 The decision to repurchase shares at any given point in time is based on such factors as the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value, the potential impact on our capital structure (including compliance with our 3.75x maximum leverage ratio and other financial covenants in our debt agreements as well as our available liquidity), and 43 Table of Contents the expected return on competing uses of capital such as dealership acquisitions, capital investments in our current businesses, or repurchases of our debt. Senior Note Repurchases and Debt Prepayment We may from time to time repurchase our outstanding senior unsecured notes in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. Additionally, we may in the future prepay other debt. The decision to repurchase senior unsecured notes or to prepay other debt is based on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. Capital Expenditures The following table sets forth information regarding our capital expenditures over the past three years: (In millions) 2014 2013 2012 Purchases of property and equipment, including operating lease buy-outs (1) $ 197.8 $ 207.2 $ 183.6 (1) Includes accrued construction in progress and excludes property acquired under capital leases. Excluding land purchased for future sites and lease buy-outs, and net of related asset sales, we anticipate that our capital expenditures, including accrued construction in progress, will be approximately $235 million in 2015 primarily related to our store facilities. Acquisitions and Divestitures The following table sets forth information regarding cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished, over the past three years: (In millions) 2014 2013 2012 Cash received from (used in) business acquisitions, net (1) $ (205.2 ) $ (87.9 ) $ (141.6 ) Cash received from (used in) business divestitures, net $ 41.4 $ 10.1 $ 6.8 (1) Excludes capital leases and deferred purchase price commitments. We purchased five stores and related assets during 2014 , compared to five in 2013 and six in 2012 . In January 2015, we purchased one store and related assets in Reno, Nevada, and in February 2015, we purchased one store and related assets in the Atlanta, Georgia market. During 2014, we divested two Import stores and our customer lead distribution business, which is reported in the Corporate and other category of our segment information. Cash Dividends We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during our two most recent fiscal years. We do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents Long-Term Debt The following table sets forth our non-vehicle long-term debt as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 : (In millions) 2014 2013 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 $ 397.1 $ 396.3 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020 350.0 350.0 Term loan facility due 2016 500.0 Revolving credit facility due 2016 300.0 Revolving credit facility due 2019 1,110.0 Mortgage facility (1) 185.5 194.7 Capital leases and other debt 85.8 98.9 2,128.4 1,839.9 Less: current maturities (25.0 ) (30.1 ) Long-term debt, net of current maturities $ 2,103.4 $ 1,809.8 (1) The mortgage facility requires monthly principal and interest payments of $1.7 million based on a fixed amortization schedule with a balloon payment of $155.4 million due November 2017. Senior Unsecured Notes At December 31, 2014 , we had outstanding $397.1 million of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018, net of debt discount. Interest is payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year. These notes will mature on April 15, 2018. At December 31, 2014 , we had outstanding $350.0 million of 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020. Interest is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year. These notes will mature on February 1, 2020. Our senior unsecured notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. Credit Agreement Under our credit agreement, we have a $1.8 billion revolving credit facility that matures on December 3, 2019. The credit agreement also contains an accordion feature that allows us, subject to credit availability and certain other conditions, to increase the amount of the revolving credit facility, together with any added term loans, by up to $500.0 million in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2014 , we had borrowings outstanding of $1.1 billion under the revolving credit facility. We have a $200.0 million letter of credit sublimit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit, which was $45.6 million at December 31, 2014 , leaving an additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility of $644.4 million at December 31, 2014 . Funds borrowed under our credit agreement may be used to repay indebtedness, finance acquisitions, and for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, and other general corporate purposes. Our revolving credit facility provides for a commitment fee on undrawn amounts of 0.20% and various interest rates on borrowings generally at LIBOR plus 1.50% . The credit spread charged for our revolving credit facility is affected by our leverage ratio. For instance, an increase in our leverage ratio from greater than or equal to 2.0 x but less than 3.25 x to greater than or equal to 3.25 x would result in a 12.5 basis point increase in the credit spread. Borrowings under the credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. Vehicle Floorplan Payable Vehicle floorplan payable-trade totaled $2.1 billion at December 31, 2014 and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2013 . Vehicle floorplan payable-trade reflects amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new vehicle inventories with manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries. 45 Table of Contents Vehicle floorplan payable-non-trade totaled $1.0 billion at December 31, 2014 , and $898.9 million at December 31, 2013 , and represents amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new and, to a lesser extent, used vehicle inventories with non-trade lenders, as well as amounts borrowed under our secured used vehicle floorplan facilities, which are primarily collateralized by used vehicle inventories and related receivables. At December 31, 2014 , the aggregate capacity under our used vehicle floorplan facilities was $315.0 million . As of that date, $236.0 million had been borrowed under those facilities, and the remaining borrowing capacity of $79.0 million was limited to $50.2 million based on the eligible used vehicle inventory that could have been pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2013 , the aggregate capacity under our used vehicle floorplan facilities was $275.0 million . As of that date, $177.3 million had been borrowed under those facilities, and the remaining borrowing capacity of $97.7 million was limited to $50.0 million based on the eligible used vehicle inventory that could have been pledged as collateral. All the vehicle floorplan facilities utilize LIBOR-based interest rates. Vehicle floorplan facilities are due on demand, but in the case of new vehicle inventories, are generally paid within several business days after the related vehicles are sold. Our manufacturer agreements generally require that the manufacturer have the ability to draft against the new vehicle floorplan facilities so the lender directly funds the manufacturer for the purchase of new vehicle inventory. Vehicle floorplan facilities are primarily collateralized by vehicle inventories and related receivables. Other Debt At December 31, 2014 , we had $185.5 million outstanding under a mortgage facility with an automotive manufacturer captive finance subsidiary that matures on November 30, 2017. The mortgage facility utilizes a fixed interest rate of 5.864% and is secured by 10-year mortgages on certain of our store properties. The mortgage facility requires monthly principal and interest payments of $1.7 million based on a fixed amortization schedule with a balloon payment of $155.4 million due November 2017. Repayment of the mortgage facility is subject to a prepayment penalty. At December 31, 2014 , we had capital lease and other debt obligations of $85.8 million , which are due at various dates through 2034 . Restrictions and Covenants Our credit agreement, the indentures for our 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 and 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020, our vehicle floorplan facilities, and our mortgage facility contain customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on us, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell (or otherwise dispose of) assets, and to merge or consolidate with other entities. Under our credit agreement, we are required to remain in compliance with a maximum leverage ratio and maximum capitalization ratio. The leverage ratio is a contractually defined amount principally reflecting non-vehicle debt divided by a contractually defined measure of earnings with certain adjustments. The capitalization ratio is a contractually defined amount principally reflecting vehicle floorplan payable and non-vehicle debt divided by our total capitalization including vehicle floorplan payable. Under our credit agreement, the maximum leverage ratio is 3.75x (no change from our prior credit agreement) and the maximum capitalization ratio is 70.0% (compared to 65.0% under the prior credit agreement). In calculating our leverage and capitalization ratios, we are not required to include letters of credit in the definition of debt (except to the extent of letters of credit in excess of $150.0 million). In addition, in calculating our capitalization ratio, we are permitted to add back to shareholders equity all goodwill, franchise rights, and long-lived asset impairment charges subsequent to September 30, 2014 plus $1.53 billion . The specific terms of these covenants can be found in our credit agreement, which we filed with our Current Report on Form 8-K on December 4, 2014. The indentures for our 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 and 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020 contain certain limited covenants, including limitations on liens and sale and leaseback transactions, but do not contain restricted payments covenants or debt incurrence restrictions. Our mortgage facility contains covenants regarding maximum cash flow leverage and minimum interest coverage. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt agreements could permit acceleration of all of our indebtedness. Our debt agreements have cross-default provisions that trigger a default in the event of an uncured default under other material indebtedness of AutoNation. 46 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2014 , we were in compliance with the requirements of the financial covenants under our debt agreements. Under the terms of our credit agreement, at December 31, 2014 , our leverage ratio and capitalization ratio were as follows: December 31, 2014 Requirement Actual Leverage ratio 3.75x 2.30x Capitalization ratio 70.0% 59.2% Both the leverage ratio and the capitalization ratio limit our ability to incur additional non-vehicle debt. The capitalization ratio also limits our ability to incur additional vehicle floorplan indebtedness. In the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings, none of the covenants described above would be impacted. In addition, availability under the credit agreement described above would not be impacted should a downgrade in the senior unsecured debt credit ratings occur. Cash Flows The following table summarizes the changes in our cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities: Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2014 2013 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 485.1 $ 484.1 $ 316.6 Net cash used in investing activities $ (376.0 ) $ (257.8 ) $ (297.8 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (102.9 ) $ (226.8 ) $ (35.7 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our primary sources of operating cash flows are collections from contracts-in-transit and customers following the sale of vehicles and proceeds from vehicle floorplan payable-trade. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are repayments of vehicle floorplan payable-trade, personnel-related expenditures, and payments related to taxes and leased properties. 2014 compared to 2013 Net cash provided by operating activities was relatively flat during 2014 , as compared to 2013 , and was impacted by an increase in working capital and higher earnings. During 2014, we paid $7.2 million in connection with refinancing our indebtedness. Cash flows from operating activities reflect $1.2 million of these cash payments that we charged to expense related to this refinancing transaction. In addition, we charged to expense $0.4 million of previously deferred debt issuance costs. Cash flows from financing activities, discussed below, reflect $6.0 million of debt issuance costs that are being amortized to interest expense over the term of our credit agreement. 2013 compared to 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities increased during 2013 , as compared to 2012 , primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements and an increase in earnings. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used in capital additions, activity from business acquisitions, business divestitures, property dispositions, purchases and sales of investments, and other transactions. We will make facility and infrastructure upgrades and improvements from time to time as we identify projects that are required to maintain our current business or that we expect to provide us with acceptable rates of return. Excluding land 47 Table of Contents purchased for future sites and lease buy-outs, and net of related asset sales, we project that 2015 capital expenditures, including accrued construction in progress, will be approximately $235 million . 2014 compared to 2013 Net cash used in investing activities increased during 2014 , as compared to 2013 , primarily due to an increase in cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, an increase in property and equipment purchases, and a decrease in proceeds from the disposal of assets held for sale, partially offset by a decrease in property operating lease buy-outs and an increase in cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished. 2013 compared to 2012 Net cash used in investing activities decreased during 2013 as compared to 2012 , primarily due to a decrease in cash used in business acquisitions. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities primarily include repurchases of common stock, debt activity, changes in vehicle floorplan payable-non-trade, and proceeds from stock option exercises. 2014 compared to 2013 Under our share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, during 2014 , we repurchased 9.4 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $485.1 million (average purchase price per share of $51.59 ). Additionally, 46,752 shares were surrendered to AutoNation in 2014 to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock. During 2013 , we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $53.5 million (average purchase price per share of $47.37 ). Additionally, 44,738 shares were surrendered to AutoNation in 2013 to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock. During 2014, we amended and restated our existing unsecured credit agreement and replaced our $500.0 million term loan facility and $1.2 billion revolving credit facility with a $1.8 billion revolving credit facility. The indebtedness outstanding under the prior credit agreement was paid off with proceeds from our amended credit agreement. We also paid $6.0 million in connection with refinancing our indebtedness. These debt issuance costs are reflected in cash flows from financing activities and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of our credit agreement. During 2014 , we borrowed $2.8 billion and repaid $2.0 billion under our revolving credit facilities, for net borrowings of $810.0 million . During 2013 , we borrowed $0.8 billion and repaid $1.1 billion under our revolving credit facilities, for net repayments of $240.0 million . We made payments of capital lease and other debt obligations of $24.7 million during 2014 and $26.2 million during 2013 . Cash flows from financing activities include changes in vehicle floorplan payable-non-trade (vehicle floorplan payables with lenders other than the automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries for that franchise) totaling net proceeds of $61.6 million during 2014 compared to net proceeds of $89.0 million in 2013 . During 2014 , cash flows from financing activities were also impacted by an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options as compared to 2013 . 2013 compared to 2012 Net cash used in financing activities increased during 2013 , as compared to 2012 , primarily due to the net impact of the debt activity that occurred in 2012, described below, as well as an increase in net repayments under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by a decrease in repurchases of common stock. On February 1, 2012, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020. See Long-Term Debt - Senior Unsecured Notes above for additional information regarding our 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020. Cash flows from financing activities in 2012 reflect cash payments of $6.0 million for debt issuance costs that are being amortized to expense over the term of the related debt. 48 Table of Contents On April 16, 2012, we redeemed all of our outstanding 7% Senior Notes due 2014 at 100% of principal, for which we paid $14.7 million . Contractual Payment Obligations The following table summarizes our payment obligations under certain contracts at December 31, 2014 . The amounts presented are based upon, among other things, the terms of any relevant agreements. Future events, including acquisitions, divestitures, new or revised operating lease agreements, borrowings or repayments under our credit agreement, and purchases or refinancing of our securities could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts. Payments Due by Period (In millions) Total Less Than 1 Year (2015) 1 - 3 Years (2016 and 2017) 3 - 5 Years (2018 and 2019) More Than 5 Years (2020 and thereafter) Vehicle floorplan payable (Note 3) (1) $ 3,097.2 $ 3,097.2 $ $ $ Long-term debt, including capital leases (Note 7) (1)(2) 2,128.4 25.0 187.7 1,551.1 364.6 Interest payments (3) 254.2 61.7 118.4 58.3 15.8 Operating lease and other commitments (Note 8) (1)(4) 412.9 43.2 78.9 65.4 225.4 Unrecognized tax benefits, net (Note 11) (1) 6.6 2.4 4.2 Deferred compensation obligations (5) 63.4 1.9 61.5 Estimated chargeback liability (Note 19) (1)(6) 84.9 47.7 33.4 3.7 0.1 Estimated self insurance obligations (Note 6) (1)(7) 71.4 24.9 24.0 11.1 11.4 Purchase obligations (8) 199.1 152.2 45.9 0.3 0.7 Total $ 6,318.1 $ 3,453.8 $ 490.7 $ 1,689.9 $ 683.7 (1) See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Amounts for long-term debt obligations exclude $2.9 million of unamortized debt discount related to our 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018. (3) Primarily represents scheduled fixed interest payments on our outstanding senior unsecured notes, mortgage facility, and capital leases. Estimates of future interest payments for vehicle floorplan payables and other variable rate debt are excluded. (4) Amounts for operating lease commitments do not include certain operating expenses such as maintenance, insurance, and real estate taxes. In 2014 , these charges totaled approximately $24 million . (5) Due to uncertainty regarding timing of payments expected beyond one year, long-term obligations for deferred compensation arrangements have been classified in the More Than 5 Years column. (6) Our estimated chargeback obligations do not have scheduled maturities, however, the timing of future payments is estimated based on historical patterns. (7) Our estimated self insurance obligations are based on management estimates and actuarial calculations. Although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, the timing of future payments is estimated based on historical patterns. (8) Primarily represents purchase orders and contracts in connection with information technology and communication systems, as well as real estate construction projects and acquisition-related commitments. We expect that the amounts above will be funded through cash flows from operations or borrowings under our credit agreement. In the case of payments due upon the maturity of our debt instruments, we currently expect to be able to refinance such instruments in the normal course of business. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and/or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2014 , surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash deposits totaled $93.7 million , of which $45.6 million represented letters of credit. We do not currently provide cash 49 Table of Contents collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We have negotiated a letter of credit sublimit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under this revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit. As further discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, there are various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2014 , we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

Our forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations concerning future results and events, and they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to revise or update these statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. The risks, uncertainties, and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include, but are not limited to, the following: The automotive retail industry is sensitive to changing economic conditions and various other factors. Our business and results of operations are substantially dependent on new vehicle sales levels in the United States and in our particular geographic markets and the level of gross profit margins that we can achieve on our sales of new vehicles, all of which are very difficult to predict . If we are not able to maintain and enhance our retail brands and reputation or to attract consumers to our own digital channels, or if events occur that damage our retail brands, reputation, or sales channels, our business and financial results may be harmed . We are dependent upon the success and continued financial viability of the vehicle manufacturers and distributors with which we hold franchises . New laws, regulations, or governmental policies regarding fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission standards, or changes to existing standards, may affect vehicle manufacturers ability to produce cost-effective vehicles or vehicles that consumers demand, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flow, and prospects . Our new vehicle sales are impacted by the consumer incentive, marketing, and other programs of vehicle manufacturers . Natural disasters and adverse weather events can disrupt our business . We are subject to restrictions imposed by, and significant influence from, vehicle manufacturers that may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects, including our ability to acquire additional stores . 50 Table of Contents We are subject to numerous legal and administrative proceedings, which, if the outcomes are adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects . Our operations are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations. If we are found to be in purported violation of or subject to liabilities under any of these laws or regulations, or if new laws or regulations are enacted that adversely affect our operations, our business, operating results, and prospects could suffer . A failure of our information systems or any security breach or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our business . Our debt agreements contain certain financial ratios and other restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, and our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations . We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our vehicle floorplan payables, revolving credit facility, and term loan facility that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability . Our largest stockholders, as a result of their ownership stakes in us, may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders or Board of Directors. In addition, future share repurchases and fluctuations in the levels of ownership of our largest stockholders could impact the volume of trading, liquidity, and market price of our common stock . Goodwill and other intangible assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets. We must test our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually, which could result in a material, non-cash write-down of goodwill or franchise rights and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity .
