Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 6, "Selected Financial Data" and Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Consolidated Financial Statements." In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations, and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in "Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" included elsewhere in this annual report. Overview At December 31, 2017 , our worldwide hotel portfolio consisted of 719 full and select service hotels ( 182,913 rooms), including: 305 managed properties ( 99,114 rooms), all of which we operate under management agreements with third-party property owners; 348 franchised properties ( 57,489 rooms), all of which are owned by third parties that have franchise agreements with us and are operated by third parties; 31 owned properties ( 15,791 rooms) (including 1 consolidated hospitality venture), 1 capital leased property ( 171 rooms), and 7 operating leased properties ( 2,411 rooms), all of which we manage; and 23 managed properties and 4 franchised properties owned or leased by unconsolidated hospitality ventures ( 7,937 rooms). Our worldwide property portfolio also included: 3 destination wellness resorts ( 399 rooms), all of which we own and operate (including 1 consolidated hospitality venture); 6 all inclusive resorts ( 2,401 rooms), all of which are owned by a third party in which we hold common shares and which operates the resorts under franchise agreements with us; 16 vacation ownership properties, all of which are licensed by ILG under the Hyatt Residence Club brand and operated by third parties, including ILG and its affiliates; and 20 residential properties, which consist of branded residences and serviced apartments. We manage all of the serviced apartments and those branded residential units that participate in a rental program with an adjacent Hyatt-branded hotel. Our worldwide property portfolio also included branded spas and fitness studios, comprised of leased and managed locations. We believe our business model allows us to pursue more diversified revenue and income streams that balance both the advantages and risks associated with these lines of business. Our expertise and experience in each of these areas gives us the flexibility to evaluate growth opportunities across these lines of business. Growth in the number of management and franchise agreements and earnings therefrom typically results in higher overall returns on invested capital because the capital investment under a typical management or franchise agreement is not significant. The capital required to build and maintain hotels we manage or franchise for third-party owners is typically provided by the owner of the respective property with minimal capital required by us as the manager or franchisor. During periods of increasing demand, we do not share fully in the incremental profits of hotel operations for hotels we manage for third-party owners as our fee arrangements generally include a base amount calculated using the revenue from the subject hotel and an incentive fee that is, typically, a percentage of hotel profits that is usually less than 20%, with certain financial thresholds to be satisfied, with the actual level depending on the structure and terms of the management agreement. We do not share in the benefits of increases in profits from franchised properties because franchisees pay us an initial application fee and ongoing royalty fees that are calculated as a percentage of gross room revenues, and also at times as a percentage of food and beverage revenues, with no fees based on profits. Disputes or disruptions may arise with third-party owners of hotels we manage, franchise, or license and these disputes can result in termination of the relevant agreement. 62 Table of Contents With respect to property ownership, we believe ownership of selected hotels in key markets enhances our ability to control our brand presence in these markets. Ownership of hotels allows us to capture the full benefit of increases in operating profits during periods of increasing demand and room rates. The cost structure of a typical hotel is more fixed than variable, so as demand and room rates increase over time, the pace of increase in operating profits typically is higher than the pace of increase of revenues. Hotel ownership is, however, more capital intensive than managing hotels for third-party owners, as we are responsible for the costs and all capital expenditures for our owned hotels. The profits realized from our owned and leased hotels are generally more significantly affected by economic downturns and declines in revenues than the results of our managed and franchised properties. This is because we absorb the full impact of declining profits for our owned and leased hotels whereas our management and franchise fees do not have the same level of downside exposure to declining hotel profitability. See also " Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations Expenses Factors Affecting Our Costs and Expenses Fixed nature of expenses." and Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business We are exposed to the risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate, which could increase our costs, reduce our profits, limit our ability to respond to market conditions, or restrict our growth strategy." For the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 , 80.5% , 80.6% , and 80.7% of our revenues were derived from operations in the United States, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , 76.9% and 78.4% of our long-lived assets were located in the United States, respectively. We report our consolidated operations in U.S. dollars. Amounts are reported in millions, unless otherwise noted. Percentages may not recompute due to rounding and percentage changes that are not meaningful are presented as "NM". Constant currency disclosures throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are non-GAAP measures. See " Key Business Metrics Evaluated by Management Constant dollar currency" below for further discussion of constant currency disclosures. We manage our business within four reportable segments, see Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements." Key Business Metrics Evaluated by Management Revenues We primarily derive our revenues from owned and leased hotel operations, management and franchise fees, other revenues from managed and franchised properties, and other revenues. Management uses revenues to assess the overall performance of our business and analyze trends such as consumer demand, brand preference, and competition. For a detailed discussion of the factors that affect our revenues, see " Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations Revenues." Net Income Attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation Net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation represents the total earnings or profits generated by our business. Management uses net income to analyze the performance of our business on a consolidated basis. Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") and EBITDA We use the terms Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA throughout this annual report. Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA, as we define them, are non-GAAP measures (as defined below). We define consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation plus our pro rata share of unconsolidated hospitality ventures Adjusted EBITDA based on our ownership percentage of each venture, adjusted to exclude the following items: interest expense; provision for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; equity earnings (losses) from unconsolidated hospitality ventures; stock-based compensation expense; gains (losses) on sales of real estate; asset impairments; and other income (loss), net. 63 Table of Contents We calculate consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by adding the Adjusted EBITDA of each of our reportable segments and eliminations to corporate and other Adjusted EBITDA. See " Results of Operations." Our board of directors and executive management team focus on Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance and compensation measure both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. Adjusted EBITDA assists us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operations both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, also evaluates the performance of each of our reportable segments and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, in significant part, by assessing the Adjusted EBITDA of each segment. In addition, the compensation committee of our board of directors determines the annual variable compensation for certain members of our management based in part on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, segment Adjusted EBITDA, or some combination of both. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides investors the same information we use internally for purposes of assessing our operating performance and making compensation decisions. Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA are not substitutes for net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation, net income, or any other measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). There are limitations to using non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA. Although we believe that Adjusted EBITDA can make an evaluation of our operating performance more consistent because it removes items that do not reflect our core operations, other companies in our industry may define Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use Adjusted EBITDA or similarly named non-GAAP measures that other companies may use to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of the income generated by our business. Our management addresses these limitations by reference to our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA supplementally. See our consolidated statements of income in our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Consolidated Financial Statements." For a reconciliation of net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation to EBITDA and a reconciliation of EBITDA to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, see " Results of Operations." Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses, as we define it, is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses exclude the impact of expenses related to benefit programs funded through rabbi trusts and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses assist us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis since it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operations, both on a segment and consolidated basis. See " Results of Operations" for a reconciliation of selling, general, and administrative expenses to Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses. Constant Dollar Currency We report the results of our operations both on an as reported basis, as well as on a constant dollar basis. Constant dollar currency, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the effects of movements in foreign currency exchange rates between comparative periods. We believe constant dollar analysis provides valuable information regarding our results as it removes currency fluctuations from our operating results. We calculate constant dollar currency by restating prior-period local currency financial results at the current period exchange rates. These adjusted amounts are then compared to our current period reported amounts to provide operationally driven variances in our results. Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) RevPAR is the product of ADR and the average daily occupancy percentage. RevPAR does not include non-room revenues, which consist of ancillary revenues generated by a hotel property, such as food and beverage, parking, and other guest service revenues. Our management uses RevPAR to identify trend information with respect to room revenues from comparable properties and to evaluate hotel performance on a regional and segment basis. RevPAR is a commonly used performance measure in our industry. RevPAR changes driven predominantly by changes in occupancy have different implications for overall revenue levels and incremental profitability than do changes driven predominantly by changes in average room rates. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in room revenues and additional variable operating costs (including housekeeping services, utilities, and room amenity costs), and could also result in increased ancillary revenues (including food 64 Table of Contents and beverage). In contrast, changes in average room rates typically have a greater impact on margins and profitability as there is no substantial effect on variable costs. Average Daily Rate ADR represents hotel room revenues, divided by the total number of rooms sold in a given period. ADR measures average room price attained by a hotel and ADR trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. ADR is a commonly used performance measure in our industry, and we use ADR to assess the pricing levels we are able to generate by customer group, as changes in rates have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy, as described above. Occupancy Occupancy represents the total number of rooms sold divided by the total number of rooms available at a hotel or group of hotels. Occupancy measures the utilization of a hotels' available capacity. We use occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. Occupancy levels also help us determine achievable ADR levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases. Comparable Hotels "Comparable systemwide hotels" represents all properties we manage or franchise (including owned and leased properties) and that are operated for the entirety of the periods being compared and that have not sustained substantial damage, business interruption, or undergone large scale renovations during the periods being compared or for which comparable results are not available. We may use variations of comparable systemwide hotels to specifically refer to comparable systemwide Americas full service or select service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the Americas management and franchising segment, comparable systemwide ASPAC full service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the ASPAC management and franchising segment, or comparable systemwide EAME/SW Asia full service or select service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the EAME/SW Asia management and franchising segment. "Comparable operated hotels" is defined the same as "comparable systemwide hotels" with the exception that it is limited to only those hotels we manage or operate and excludes hotels we franchise. "Comparable owned and leased hotels" represents all properties we own or lease and that are operated and consolidated for the entirety of the periods being compared and have not sustained substantial damage, business interruption, or undergone large scale renovations during the periods being compared or for which comparable results are not available. Comparable systemwide hotels and comparable owned and leased hotels are commonly used as a basis of measurement in our industry. "Non-comparable systemwide hotels" or "Non-comparable owned and leased hotels" represent all hotels that do not meet the respective definition of "comparable" as defined above. Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations Revenues Principal Components We primarily derive our revenues from the following sources: Revenues from hotel operations. Represents revenues derived from hotel operations, including room rentals and food and beverage sales, and other ancillary revenues at our owned and leased properties. Revenues from the majority of our hotel operations depend heavily on demand from group and transient travelers, as discussed below. Revenues from our owned and leased hotels are primarily derived from hotel operations. Revenues from room rentals and ancillary revenues are primarily derived from three categories of customers: transient, group, and contract. Transient guests are individual travelers who are traveling for business or leisure. Our group guests are traveling for group events that reserve a minimum of 10 rooms for meetings or social functions sponsored by associations, corporate, social, military, educational, religious, or other organizations. Group business usually includes a block of room accommodations as well as other ancillary services, such as catering and banquet services. Our contract guests are traveling under a contract negotiated for a block of rooms for more than 30 days in duration at agreed-upon rates. Airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our hotels. Management and franchise fees. Represents revenues derived from fees earned from hotels and residential properties managed worldwide (usually under long-term management agreements), franchise fees received in connection with the franchising of our brands (usually under long-term franchise agreements), termination fees, the amortization of deferred gains related to sold properties for which we have significant continuing involvement, and license fees received in connection with 65 Table of Contents vacation ownership properties. For a detailed discussion of our management and franchise fees, see Part I, Item 1, "Business Management Agreements Fees" and Part I, Item 1, "Business Franchise Agreements Fees." Other revenues. Represents revenues primarily related to our co-branded credit card and exhale. Other revenues from managed and franchised properties. Represents revenues related primarily to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer, as well as reservations, sales, marketing, loyalty program, and technology costs at managed and franchised properties that are fully reimbursed by the third-party property owner based on the costs incurred, with no added margin. As a result, these revenues have no effect on our profit, although they do increase our total revenues and the corresponding costs increase our total expenses. We record these revenues in "Other revenues from managed and franchised properties" and the corresponding costs in "Other costs from managed and franchised properties" in our consolidated statements of income . Intersegment eliminations. We evaluate our reportable segments with intersegment revenues and expenses included in their results. These intersegment revenues and expenses represent management fee revenues and expenses related to our owned and leased hotels and promotional award redemption revenues and expenses related to our co-branded credit card at our owned and leased hotels, which are eliminated in consolidation. Factors Affecting Our Revenues For other factors affecting our revenues, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business." Consumer demand and global economic conditions . Consumer demand for our products and services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. Declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions, risks affecting or reducing travel patterns, risks related to natural or man-made disasters, lower consumer confidence, adverse political conditions, currency volatility, impacts of terrorism, and declining oil prices can lower the revenues and profitability of our owned hotel operations and the amount of management and franchising fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties. Also, declines in hotel profitability during an economic downturn directly impact the incentive portion of our management fees, since it is based on hotel profit measures. As a result, changes in consumer demand and general business cycles can subject and have subjected our revenues to significant volatility. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors Risks Related to the Hospitality Industry." RevPAR Statistics (Comparable locations) RevPAR Year Ended December 31, Number of comparable hotels (1) 2017 2016 Change Change (in constant $) Systemwide hotels 589 $ 137 $ 133 3.3 % 3.3 % Owned and leased hotels 35 $ 176 $ 174 1.0 % 0.9 % Americas full service hotels 150 $ 155 $ 151 2.4 % 2.4 % Americas select service hotels 296 $ 108 $ 105 2.9 % 2.9 % ASPAC full service hotels 69 $ 148 $ 140 5.4 % 5.8 % EAME/SW Asia full service hotels 63 $ 123 $ 117 4.5 % 3.9 % EAME/SW Asia select service hotels 10 $ 71 $ 63 12.0 % 10.3 % (1) Comparable systemwide hotels include one select service hotel in ASPAC, which is not included in the ASPAC full service hotel statistics. The number of comparable hotels presented above includes owned and leased hotels. Systemwide RevPAR increased 3.3% during 2017 compared to 2016 driven by improved transient ADR and demand across each of our segments as well as increased group ADR and demand in the Americas and ASPAC. RevPAR related to owned and leased hotels increased due to increases in transient demand in the United States and Europe. Group ADR growth at our full service hotels resulted in increased group revenue despite lower group demand during 2017 compared to 2016. Group revenue booked in 2017 for stays in 2017 was lower compared to 2016. Group revenue booked in 2017 for stays in future years increased compared to 2016 driven by strong fourth quarter production. See " Segment Results" for discussion of RevPAR by segment. Competition. The global lodging industry is highly competitive. While lodging demand has continued to grow over the last several years, we have also seen an increase in supply, particularly in certain key markets. This increased supply can put 66 Table of Contents significant pressure on ADR levels at our properties as well as those of our competitors. Despite this increased supply, our systemwide RevPAR levels have increased each year since 2009. We also face competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry, including online travel services and peer-to-peer inventory sources, as well as industry consolidation. We believe our brand strength and ability to manage our operations in an efficient manner will help us to continue competing successfully within the global hospitality industry. Agreements with third-party owners and franchisees and relationships with developers . We depend on our long-term management and franchise agreements with third-party owners and franchisees for a significant portion of our management and franchising fee revenues. The success and sustainability of our management and franchising business depends on our ability to perform under our management and franchising agreements and maintain good relationships with third-party owners and franchisees. Our relationships with these third parties also generate new relationships with developers and opportunities for property development that can support our growth. We believe we have good relationships with our third-party owners, franchisees, and developers in all of our segments and are committed to the continued growth and development of these relationships. These relationships exist with a diverse group of owners, franchisees, and developers and are not heavily concentrated with any particular third party. Access to capital . The hospitality industry is a capital intensive business that requires significant amounts of capital expenditures to develop, maintain, and renovate properties. Third-party owners are required to fund these capital expenditures for the properties they own in accordance with the terms of the applicable management or franchise agreement. Access to the capital that we or our third-party owners, franchisees, or development partners need to finance the construction of new properties or to maintain and renovate existing properties is critical to the continued growth of our business and our revenues. The availability of capital or the conditions under which we or our third-party owners, franchisees, or development partners can obtain capital can have a significant impact on the overall level and pace of future development and therefore the ability to grow our revenues. Expenses Principal Components We primarily incur the following expenses: Owned and leased hotels expenses. Owned and leased hotels expenses reflect the expenses of our consolidated owned and leased hotels. Expenses to operate our hotels include room expense, food and beverage costs, other support costs, and property expenses. Room expense includes compensation costs for housekeeping, laundry, and front desk staff and supply costs for guest room amenities and laundry. Food and beverage costs include costs for wait and kitchen staff and food and beverage products. Other support expenses consist of costs associated with property-level management (including deferred compensation plans for certain employees that are funded through contributions to rabbi trusts), utilities, sales and marketing, operating hotel spas, parking and other guest recreation, entertainment, and services. Property expenses include property taxes, repairs and maintenance, rent, and insurance. Depreciation and amortization expenses. These are non-cash expenses that primarily consist of depreciation of fixed assets such as buildings, furniture, fixtures, and equipment at our consolidated owned and leased hotels. Amortization expense primarily consists of amortization of management and franchise agreement intangibles and lease related intangibles. Selling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense, including deferred compensation plans for certain employees that are funded through contributions to rabbi trusts, for our corporate staff and personnel supporting our business segments (including regional offices that support our management and franchising segments), professional fees (including consulting, audit, and legal fees), travel and entertainment expenses, sales and marketing expenses, bad debt expenses, and office administrative and related expenses. Other costs from managed and franchised properties. Represents costs related primarily to payroll expenses at managed properties where we are the employer, as well as reservations, sales, marketing, loyalty program, and technology costs at managed and franchised properties. These costs are reimbursed to us with no added margin. As a result, these costs have no effect on our profit, although they do increase our total expenses and the corresponding reimbursements increase our total revenues. Factors Affecting Our Costs and Expenses For other factors affecting our costs and expenses, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business." Fixed nature of expenses. Many of the expenses associated with developing, owning, operating, managing, franchising, and licensing hotels and other properties, including branded spas and fitness studios, and residential and vacation ownership 67 Table of Contents properties, are relatively fixed. These expenses include personnel costs, rent, property taxes, insurance, and utilities. If we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels and other properties decreases, the resulting decline in our revenues can have a particularly adverse effect on our net cash flow, margins, and profits. This effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth. Economic downturns generally affect the results of our owned and leased hotels segment more significantly than the results of our management and franchising segments due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased property. The effectiveness of any cost-cutting efforts is limited by the fixed-cost nature of our business. As a result, we may not always be able to offset reductions in revenue through cost cutting. Employees at some of our owned hotels are parties to collective bargaining agreements that may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues. In addition, efforts to reduce costs, or to defer or cancel capital improvements, could adversely affect the economic value of our properties and brands. We intend to manage our cost structure at levels appropriate for the degree of demand and revenue generated at our hotels. Changes in depreciation expenses. Changes in depreciation expenses may be driven by renovations of existing properties, acquisition or development of new properties, or the disposition of existing properties through sale or closure. We intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in businesses, properties, or other assets. If we consummate such acquisitions in businesses, properties, or other assets, we would likely add depreciable assets, which would result in an increase in depreciation expenses. Other Items Asset impairments We hold significant amounts of goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, and investments. We evaluate these assets on a quarterly basis for impairment as further discussed in " Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates." These evaluations have, in the past, resulted in impairment charges for certain of these assets based on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding those assets. We may be required to take additional impairment charges to reflect further declines in our asset and/or investment values. Acquisitions, divestitures, and significant renovations We routinely acquire, divest, or undertake large scale renovations of hotel properties. The results of operations derived from these properties do not, therefore, meet the definition of "comparable hotels" as defined in " Key Business Metrics Evaluated by Management." The results of operations from these properties, however, may have a material effect on our results from period to period and are, therefore, addressed separately in our discussion on results of operations when material. In 2017, we entered into the following key transactions: sold Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Gainey Ranch and Royal Palms Resort and Spa as a portfolio for a net sales price of $296 million and entered into a long-term management agreement with the purchaser for each property; sold Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress for a net sales price of $202 million and entered into a long-term management agreement with the purchaser of the hotel; sold Hyatt Regency Louisville for a net sales price of $65 million and entered into a long-term franchise agreement with the purchaser of the hotel; sold Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel & Spa on Del Monte Golf Course for a net sales price of $58 million and entered into a long-term franchise agreement with the purchaser of the hotel; and acquired Miraval, the renowned provider of wellness and mindfulness experiences, for $237 million . In 2016, we entered into the following key transactions: acquired Thompson Miami Beach for a purchase price of approximately $238 million . The hotel was subsequently rebranded as The Confidante Miami Beach, and added to The Unbound Collection by Hyatt; acquired our partners' share in Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort for a net purchase price of approximately $136 million . We accounted for the transaction as a step acquisition and recognized a gain through equity earnings (losses) from unconsolidated hospitality ventures of $14 million . Additionally, prior to the acquisition the unconsolidated hospitality venture repaid $121 million of third-party debt; acquired Royal Palms Resort and Spa in Phoenix, Arizona for a net purchase price of approximately $86 million and added the hotel to The Unbound Collection by Hyatt; 68 Table of Contents sold Andaz 5th Avenue for a net sales price of $240 million and entered into a long-term management agreement with the purchaser of the hotel; and sold the shares of the company that owns Hyatt Regency Birmingham (U.K.) for a net sales price of approximately $49 million and entered into a long-term management agreement with the purchaser of the hotel. In 2015, we entered into the following key transactions: sold Hyatt Regency Indianapolis for a net sales price of $69 million and entered into a long-term franchise agreement with the purchaser of the hotel; and sold an entity which held an interest in one of our foreign currency denominated equity method investments, for which we received proceeds of $3 million . In connection with the sale, we released $21 million of accumulated foreign currency translation losses. Effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations A significant portion of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency which is the U.S. dollar. As a result, we are required to translate those results from the functional currency into U.S. dollars at market based average exchange rates during the period reported. When comparing our results of operations between periods, there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in exchange rates experienced between those periods. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors Risks Related to the Hospitality Industry Because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the United States, the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits, or disrupt our business." 69 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 Discussion on Consolidated Results For additional information regarding our consolidated results, please also refer to our consolidated statements of income included in Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Consolidated Financial Statements." The impact from our investments in marketable securities held to fund operating programs, including securities held to fund our benefit programs funded through a rabbi trust and securities held to fund the World of Hyatt loyalty program, were recorded on the various financial statement line items discussed below and have no impact on net income. Owned and leased hotels revenues . 2017 compared to 2016 Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Better / (Worse) Currency Impact Comparable owned and leased hotels revenues $ 1,832 $ 1,812 $ 20 1.1 % $ 3 Non-comparable owned and leased hotels revenues 360 296 64 21.3 % (1 ) Total owned and leased hotels revenues $ 2,192 $ 2,108 $ 84 3.9 % $ 2 The increase in owned and leased hotels revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was driven primarily by acquisitions and improved transient business in the United States and Aruba. This was partially offset by hotels sold in 2016 and 2017 and results of certain international hotels. 2016 compared to 2015 Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Better / (Worse) Currency Impact Comparable owned and leased hotels revenues $ 2,018 $ 2,017 $ 1 % $ (23 ) Non-comparable owned and leased hotels revenues 90 62 28 45.2 % (2 ) Total owned and leased hotels revenues $ 2,108 $ 2,079 $ 29 1.4 % $ (25 ) The increase in comparable owned and leased hotels revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was driven primarily by full service hotels in the United States and Mexico, largely offset by decreases at certain of our international hotels which were driven primarily by market weakness in France, rate and occupancy declines in Switzerland, and unfavorable net currency impact. The increase in non-comparable owned and leased hotels revenues was driven by acquisitions and openings in 2016, partially offset by hotels sold in 2015 and 2016. See " Segment Results" for further discussion of owned and leased hotels revenues. Management and franchise fee revenues. Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Better / (Worse) 2017 vs 2016 Better / (Worse) 2016 vs 2015 Base management fees $ 202 $ 190 $ 187 $ 12 6.3 % $ 3 1.6 % Incentive management fees 135 117 113 18 15.7 % 4 3.5 % Franchise fees 115 104 88 11 10.8 % 16 18.2 % Other fee revenues 53 37 39 16 42.3 % (2 ) (5.1 )% Total management and franchise fees $ 505 $ 448 $ 427 $ 57 12.8 % $ 21 4.9 % The increase in management and franchise fees, which included an insignificant net favorable currency impact for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared to the same period in 2016 , was driven primarily by increases in management fees across all reportable segments and higher franchise fees in the Americas management and franchising segment due to new hotel 70 Table of Contents openings and improved performance. Additionally, other fee revenues increased due to termination fees related to three hotels in the Americas. The increase in management and franchise fees included net unfavorable currency impact of $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in franchise fees was driven by new and converted hotels and improved performance at existing hotels in the Americas. The increases in management fees were driven primarily by improved performance at full service and select service properties in the Americas and full service properties in ASPAC, partially offset by decreased performance in Europe. See " Segment Results" for further discussion. Other revenues. Other revenues increased $30 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 , driven by the sales of villas at Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort of $13 million, the acquisition of exhale, and higher revenue from our co-branded credit card program as a result of increased point sales and our new agreement which took effect in the second quarter of 2017.

Additionally, the increase is due to a higher volume of reimbursements from our existing properties for increased technology costs, redemptions related to the loyalty program, and payroll and related costs. Excluding the impact of rabbi trust, other revenues from managed and franchised properties increased during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, due to a higher volume of reimbursements for increased redemptions related to the loyalty program, technology and reservation costs, and select service payroll and related costs, partially offset by a decrease in full service payroll and related costs driven by hotel conversions and a hotel that left the chain.

See " Segment Results" for a discussion of the non-comparable owned and leased hotels activity in 2017 and 2016. Comparable owned and leased hotels expense also increased driven by higher payroll and related costs, including severance charges at certain properties, and increased technology costs. Additionally, expenses recognized with respect to our employee benefit programs funded through rabbi trusts increased driven by the performance of the underlying invested assets during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. 71 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Better / (Worse) Comparable owned and leased hotels expense $ 1,520 $ 1,512 $ (8 ) (0.5 )% Non-comparable owned and leased hotels expense 87 49 (38 ) (77.6 )% Rabbi trust impact 3 1 (2 ) (200.0 )% Total owned and leased hotels expense $ 1,610 $ 1,562 $ (48 ) (3.1 )% Comparable owned and leased hotels expense included $15 million net favorable currency impact during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was driven primarily by increased payroll and related costs, partially offset by a decrease in utilities expenses due to lower gas and oil prices. Non-comparable owned and leased hotels expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, driven by the acquisitions and openings in 2016, partially offset by hotels sold in 2015 and 2016. See " Segment Results" for a discussion of the non-comparable owned and leased hotels activity in 2016 and 2015. Additionally, expenses recognized with respect to our employee benefit programs funded through rabbi trusts increased driven by the performance of the underlying invested assets during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense . Depreciation and amortization expense increased $24 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 , driven primarily by acquisitions, a hotel opening, and technology assets placed in service in 2016 and 2017. Additional depreciation expense was recognized due to accelerated depreciation related to renovations at certain of our owned hotels during 2017. The increase was partially offset by decreased depreciation related to hotels sold in 2016 and 2017. A portion of the depreciation related to technology projects is recovered from our managed and franchised hotels and the corresponding recovery is included in other income (loss), net on our consolidated statements of income. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $22 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, driven primarily by depreciation for assets placed in service in 2015 and 2016 related to technology projects, acquisitions and hotel openings, partially offset by decreased depreciation related to the sale of Andaz 5th Avenue in the second quarter of 2016. Other direct costs . Other direct costs increased $16 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 , primarily due to the sales of villas at Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the acquisition of exhale.

Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared to the same period in 2016 , driven primarily by a $19 million increase in payroll and related costs, including $7 million of severance charges, the acquisitions of Miraval and exhale, and marketing initiatives during 2017, including master brand marketing expenses to support the launch of the World of Hyatt platform. Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, driven primarily by a $10 million decrease in professional fees related to certain initiatives completed in 2015, partially offset by a $5 million increase in payroll and related costs. 72 Table of Contents Net gains and interest income from marketable securities held to fund operating programs .

The increase during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was attributable to the following: $42 million increase in earnings attributable to distributions from three of our unconsolidated hospitality ventures primarily related to debt refinancings; $35 million increase due to foreign currency volatility at one of our unconsolidated hospitality ventures which holds loans denominated in a currency other than its functional currency. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized foreign currency gains of $7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 in which we recognized foreign currency losses of $28 million. A portion of the loan balance was refinanced at the end of 2015 and therefore we anticipate decreased exposure in future periods as compared to 2015; $14 million aforementioned gain on the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort acquisition; $21 million increase as a result of losses recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the sale of an entity that held an interest in one of our foreign currency denominated unconsolidated hospitality ventures and the release of accumulated foreign currency translation losses upon sale; $13 million increase primarily attributable to expenses recognized in the year ended December 31, 2015 related to debt repayment guarantees entered into on behalf of our unconsolidated hospitality ventures; and $9 million decrease related to impairment charges recorded related to four unconsolidated hospitality ventures during the year ended December 31, 2016. 73 Table of Contents Interest expense . Interest expense increased $4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 , driven by a higher average outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit during 2017, which was repaid during the fourth quarter of 2017. Interest expense increased $8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, driven by increased interest expense related to the 2026 notes issued in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by decreased interest expense related to the 2016 notes which were redeemed during the second quarter of 2016. Gains (losses) on sales of real estate. During the year ended December 31, 2017 , we sold Hyatt Regency Louisville and Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel & Spa on Del Monte Golf Course resulting in a pre-tax gains of $35 million and $17 million , respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold Andaz 5th Avenue resulting in a pre-tax loss of $23 million . During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold Hyatt Regency Indianapolis and a Hyatt House hotel resulting in a $9 million pre-tax gain. See Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information regarding the above transactions. Asset impairments. We did not record any asset impairments during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $5 million in asset impairment charges related to property and equipment within our owned and leased hotels segment. Other income (loss), net . Other income (loss), net increased $31 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 . See Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information. The increase was primarily attributable to the following: $94 million of interest income and $40 million of realized losses related to the redemption of our preferred shares in Playa Hotels & Resorts B.V. ("Playa"). See Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information; $18 million of pre-condemnation income in exchange for the relinquishment of subterranean space at an owned hotel; $15 million decrease in performance guarantee liability amortization income primarily related to four managed hotels in France that are subject to a performance guarantee ("the four managed hotels in France"). See Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements" for further detail; $21 million cease use liability related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters; and $14 million increase in performance guarantee expense, net. The increase primarily relates to the four managed hotels in France for which we recognized $76 million and $64 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Due to ongoing renovations, we expect to recognize approximately $65 to $75 million of expense in 2018 related to this guarantee. Other income (loss), net increased $7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily attributable to the following: $22 million increase in performance guarantee liability amortization income recognized primarily related to the four managed hotels in France; $15 million increase primarily due to foreign currency volatility of the Brazilian real largely related to a construction loan for Grand Hyatt Rio de Janeiro; $13 million increase in depreciation recovery related to expense recovered from our managed and franchised hotels; $12 million of interest income related to the early redemption of a portion of our Playa preferred shares. We also recognized a $6 million realized loss in conjunction with the redemption; and $36 million increase in performance guarantee expense, net. We recognized expenses of $64 million and $28 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, related to the performance guarantee for the four managed hotels in France. 74 Table of Contents Provision for income taxes .

Income tax expense also increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 , as a result of an increase in income before taxes driven primarily by the earnings recognized from the sale of Avendra. As a result of U.S. tax reform, we expect our global effective tax rate to reduce beginning in 2018, driven primarily by the reduced U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% on our U.S. earnings, which will be partially offset by increased limitations on compensation and fringe benefit deductions. The decreased effective tax rate during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was driven primarily by a 5 percentage point favorable impact of certain one-time items related to the reversal of uncertain tax positions and by a 3 percentage point impact driven by a nonrecurring foreign tax credit benefit related to a foreign unconsolidated hospitality venture.

The revenue growth at our comparable hotels in the United States was driven primarily by improved transient business and a business interruption settlement of $6 million related to a claim from a prior year. The increase in comparable international hotels was driven by a net favorable currency impact of $3 million and increased transient business at our hotel in Aruba, partially offset by decreased performance at our hotel in Switzerland. Non-comparable owned and leased hotels revenues were flat due to increased revenues from our 2016 acquisitions, primarily related to the acquisition of our partners interest in Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, offset by decreased revenues as a result of the following dispositions: Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress, Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Gainey Ranch, Hyatt Regency Louisville, and Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel & Spa on Del Monte Golf Course in 2017; and Andaz 5th Avenue and Hyatt Regency Birmingham (U.K.) in 2016.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, revenue growth at our comparable hotels in the United States and Mexico was a result of improved transient business and group ADR as well as food and beverage revenues. The decrease in comparable international hotels was driven by a net unfavorable currency impact of $15 million and decreased performance at our owned hotels in France and Switzerland. The increase in non-comparable owned and leased hotels revenues was driven by the following activity in 2016: the opening of Grand Hyatt Rio de Janeiro; the acquisitions of The Confidante Miami Beach and Royal Palms Resort and Spa; and the acquisition of our partners' interest in Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort. The increase in revenues was partially offset by the following activity: the dispositions of Andaz 5th Avenue and Hyatt Regency Birmingham (U.K.).

The increase was largely due to improved transient business and group ADR at our full service hotels in the United States and Mexico. Partially offsetting the revenue growth were increased payroll and related costs, partially offset by a decrease in utilities expense due to lower gas and oil prices in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA at our non-comparable hotels decreased $10 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to various dispositions and acquisitions in 2016. 78 Table of Contents Pro rata share of unconsolidated hospitality ventures Adjusted EBITDA . Our pro rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated hospitality ventures included an insignificant net favorable currency impact during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 . The decrease was driven primarily by the Playa business combination in the first quarter of 2017 and the acquisition of our partners' share of Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort. Our pro rata share of Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated hospitality ventures increased during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, which included an insignificant net unfavorable currency impact. The increase was driven primarily by hotel openings and improved performance at hotels within the Playa unconsolidated hospitality venture and Wailea Hotel Holdings, L.L.C. unconsolidated hospitality venture, prior to our acquisition of the latter in the fourth quarter of 2016.

The increase in management, franchise, and other fees was driven partially by a $13 million increase in other fee revenues due to termination fees for a managed hotel conversion to franchised and two hotels that left the chain, as well as increased amortization of deferred gains related to the sales of Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Gainey Ranch and Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress. Additionally, franchise fees increased $11 million and base and incentive fees increased $6 million and $2 million, respectively, primarily due to new hotels and improved performance across the region. The increase in other revenues from managed and franchised properties for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 , was due to increased reimbursements for payroll and related costs, technology costs, and redemptions related to the loyalty program. Additionally, the changes in the value of the underlying assets for our benefit programs funded through rabbi trusts resulted in a $14 million increase during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

Americas management and franchising revenues included $1 million net unfavorable currency impact during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in management, franchise, and other fees was driven by a $15 million increase in franchise fees, primarily due to new and converted hotels and improved performance at existing select service hotels and all inclusive resorts. Base fees increased $3 million, driven primarily by strong RevPAR growth at select service properties. Incentive fees increased $2 million driven by full service properties in North America.

The increase was driven by the aforementioned increases in management, franchise, and other fees. Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses were flat due to an increase in payroll and related costs, offset by higher bad debt reserves in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, which included a $1 million net unfavorable currency impact. The increase was primarily due to the aforementioned $17 million increase in management, franchise, and other fees and a $1 million decrease in adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses, primarily due to a $5 million decrease in professional fees, partially offset by a $2 million increase in bad debt reserves, $1 million increase in payroll and related costs, and a $1 million increase in brand conversion expenses.

The occupancy gains in Germany were driven by increased group business, while the United Kingdom benefited from the completion of a renovation at one hotel. France and Turkey both experienced higher demand as 2016 was impacted by heightened security concerns. These increases were partially offset by decreased ADR in the Middle East as a result of supply pressure and geopolitical events which led to lower business travel in the area. During the year ended December 31, 2017 , one property was removed from the comparable EAME/SW Asia full service systemwide hotel results as a result of significant renovations and no properties were removed from the comparable EAME/SW Asia select service systemwide hotel results. EAME/SW Asia management and franchising revenues included $2 million net unfavorable currency impact during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in management, franchise, and other fees was primarily due to a $2 million decrease in incentive fees, driven primarily by decreased performance at properties in Europe and the Middle East, partially offset by increases at properties in India and ramping of hotels opened in 2015. The increase in other revenues from managed and franchised properties during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to a higher volume of reimbursements for reservation and technology costs as well as increased redemptions related to the loyalty program. 82 Table of Contents (Comparable Systemwide Hotels) Year Ended December 31, RevPAR Occupancy ADR 2016 2015 Better / (Worse) Better / (Worse) Constant $ 2016 2015 Change in Occ % pts 2016 2015 Better / (Worse) Better / (Worse) Constant $ EAME/SW Asia full service $ 119 $ 129 (7.6 )% (4.6 )% 63.4 % 63.5 % (0.1 )% $ 188 $ 203 (7.5 )% (4.4 )% EAME/SW Asia select service $ 70 $ 65 8.6 % 9.4 % 71.9 % 64.3 % 7.6 % $ 98 $ 100 (2.8 )% (2.1 )% Excluding the net unfavorable currency impact, the decrease in comparable full service RevPAR during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was driven primarily by decreased ADR and occupancy in France, Switzerland, Turkey, and the Middle East.

Revenues increased during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, driven by a $4 million increase related to our co-branded credit card, partially offset by a $1 million decrease in Hyatt Residence Club license fees. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was driven by a $12 million increase in promotional reward redemption expense as a result of increased costs related to 83 Table of Contents our co-branded credit card, partially offset by the aforementioned $3 million increase in revenues and a $1 million decrease in adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses. The decrease in adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses was driven by a $10 million decrease in professional fees related to certain initiatives completed in 2015, partially offset by a $4 million increase in marketing expenses and a $3 million increase in payroll and related costs. 84 Table of Contents Adjusted EBITDA by Segment and Non-GAAP Measure Reconciliation The following charts illustrate Adjusted EBITDA by segment.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview We finance our business primarily with existing cash, short-term investments, and cash generated from our operations. As part of our business strategy, we also recycle capital by using net proceeds from dispositions to support our acquisitions and new investment opportunities. When appropriate, we borrow cash under our revolving credit facility or from other third-party sources and may also raise funds by issuing debt or equity securities as necessary. We maintain a cash investment policy that emphasizes preservation of capital. We believe our cash position, short-term investments, and cash from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and our access to the capital markets, will be adequate to meet all of our funding requirements and capital deployment objectives for the foreseeable future. We may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase additional amounts of our outstanding equity and/or debt securities through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. Recent Transactions Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources During the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 several transactions impacted our liquidity. See " Sources and Uses of Cash." 86 Table of Contents Sources and Uses of Cash Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 620 $ 489 $ 538 Investing activities 266 (380 ) (47 ) Financing activities (858 ) (96 ) (715 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (7 ) 12 (4 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 21 $ 25 $ (228 ) We have foreign capital investment needs in excess of foreign earnings, and we have not changed our assertion that undistributed net earnings with respect to certain foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Due to recently enacted U.S. tax legislation, all undistributed net foreign earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017 have been taxed in the U.S. Given the complexity of certain provisions, we are continuing to evaluate the application of the new legislation to our indefinite reinvestment assertion. See Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements" for further detail. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased $131 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 , primarily due to $94 million of interest income received upon the redemption of our Playa preferred shares. The increase was also due to improved performance across all reportable segments, increases in taxes payable driven by transactions, and the timing of accruals. These increases were partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2017. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $49 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 , as 2015 included the release of $82 million of restricted cash from one of our captive insurance companies which was invested in marketable securities. Additionally, the timing of certain accruals contributed to the decrease, which was partially offset by a decrease in income tax payments and the timing of insurance payments received from managed hotels. Cash Flows from Investing Activities 2017 Activity: We sold Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Gainey Ranch and Royal Palms Resort and Spa for approximately $ 296 million . Proceeds from the sale of Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Gainey Ranch of $207 million are held as restricted for use in a potential like-kind exchange.

See Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements" for further detail. In conjunction with the acquisition of Miraval, we issued $9 million of redeemable preferred shares of a subsidiary. 2016 Activity: We received net proceeds of $396 million from the issuance of our 2026 Notes, after deducting discounts and offering expenses of approximately $4 million .

Excluding the effects of currency, we drew $13 million on the construction loan for the development of the Grand Hyatt Rio de Janeiro. 2015 Activity: We repurchased 13,199,811 shares of Class A and Class B common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $715 million . Excluding the effects of currency, we drew $12 million on the construction loan for the development of the Grand Hyatt Rio de Janeiro. We define net debt as total debt less the total of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. We consider net debt and its components to be an important indicator of liquidity and a guiding measure of capital structure strategy. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The following table provides a summary of our debt to capital ratios: December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Consolidated debt (1) $ 1,451 $ 1,564 Stockholders equity 3,525 3,903 Total capital 4,976 5,467 Total debt to total capital 29.2 % 28.6 % Consolidated debt (1) 1,451 1,564 Less: Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments 552 538 Net consolidated debt 899 1,026 Net debt to total capital 18.1 % 18.8 % (1) Excludes approximately $580 million and $745 million of our share of unconsolidated hospitality venture indebtedness at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , respectively, substantially all of which is non-recourse to us and a portion of which we guarantee pursuant to separate agreements. The decrease from December 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to Playa, which is no longer an unconsolidated hospitality venture as discussed in Part IV, Item 15 "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements." 89 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures We routinely make capital expenditures to enhance our business. We classify our capital expenditures into maintenance, enhancements to existing properties, and investment in new properties under development or recently opened. We have been and will continue to be prudent with respect to our capital spending, taking into account our cash flows from operations. Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Maintenance and technology $ 80 $ 68 $ 110 Enhancements to existing properties 166 72 59 Investment in new properties under development or recently owned 52 71 100 Total capital expenditures $ 298 $ 211 $ 269 The increase in enhancements to existing properties in 2017 compared to 2016 is driven by increased renovation activity at domestic and international owned full service properties and expenditures related to our new corporate office. The decrease in investment in new properties under development or recently owned from 2016 to 2017 is due to the opening of a property that was previously under construction and the sale of an owned property under development to an unconsolidated hospitality venture. The decreases were partially offset by renovation spend in 2017 at our Miraval properties. The decrease in maintenance and technology expenditures in 2016 compared to 2015 is driven by decreased technology spending and decreased spending at domestic full service properties. The increase in enhancements to existing properties is driven by increased renovation activity at domestic and international full service properties and expenditures related to our new corporate office. Expenditures related to new properties under development are driven primarily by construction spending related to Grand Hyatt Rio de Janeiro, which opened in early 2016, and two new select service hotels under development in the United States. Senior Notes The table below sets forth the outstanding principal balance of our Senior Notes at December 31, 2017 , as defined in Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements". Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually. Description Principal amount 2019 Notes $ 196 2021 Notes 250 2023 Notes 350 2026 Notes 400 Total $ 1,196 In the indenture that governs the Senior Notes, we agreed not to: create any liens on our principal properties, or on the capital stock or debt of our subsidiaries that own or lease principal properties, to secure debt without also effectively providing that the Senior Notes are secured equally and ratably with such debt for so long as such debt is so secured; or enter into any sale and leaseback transactions with respect to our principal properties. These limitations are subject to significant exceptions. The indenture also limits our ability to enter into mergers or consolidations or transfer all or substantially all of our assets unless certain conditions are satisfied. If a change of control triggering event occurs, as defined in the indenture governing the Senior Notes, we will be required to offer to purchase the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. We may also redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption plus a make-whole amount. We are in compliance with all applicable covenants under the indenture governing our Senior Notes at December 31, 2017 . 90 Table of Contents Revolving Credit Facility On January 6, 2014, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders that amended and restated our prior revolving credit facility to extend the facility's expiration from September 9, 2016 to January 4, 2019. The revolving credit facility is intended to provide financing for working capital and general corporate purposes, including commercial paper back-up and permitted investments and acquisitions. We had no outstanding undrawn letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility (which would reduce the availability thereunder) at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , respectively. At December 31, 2017 , we had available borrowing capacity of $1.5 billion under our revolving credit facility, as there was no outstanding revolver balance. All of our borrowings under our revolving credit facility are guaranteed by substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries, as defined in the revolving credit facility. All guarantees are guarantees of payment and performance and not of collection. Hotel Investors I, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, is an additional borrower under our revolving credit facility. Interest rates on outstanding borrowings are either LIBOR-based or based on an alternate base rate, with margins in each case based on our credit rating or, in certain circumstances, our credit rating and leverage ratio. At December 31, 2017 , the interest rate for a one month LIBOR borrowing under our revolving credit facility would have been 2.664% , or LIBOR of 1.564% plus 1.100% . Borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest, at our option, at either one-, two-, three- or six-month LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.900% to 1.500% per annum (plus any mandatory costs, if applicable) or the alternative base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.000% to 0.500% per annum, in each case depending on our credit rating by either S&P or Moody or, in certain circumstances, our credit rating and leverage ratio. Borrowings under our swingline subfacility will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the alternate base rate plus the applicable percentage for revolving loans that are alternate base rate loans. We are also required to pay letter of credit fees with respect to each letter of credit equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR on the face amount of each letter of credit. In addition, we must pay a fronting fee to the issuer of each letter of credit of 0.10% per annum on the face amount of such letter of credit. The revolving credit facility also provides for a facility fee ranging from 0.100% to 0.250% of the total commitment of the lenders under the revolving credit facility (depending on our credit rating by either S&P or Moody s). The facility fee is charged regardless of the level of borrowings. In the event we no longer have a credit rating from either S&P or Moody or our rating falls at or below BBB-/Baa3, with respect to borrowings under our revolving credit facility (a) such borrowings will bear interest at either LIBOR plus 1.300% or 1.500% per annum or the alternative base rate referenced above plus 0.300% or 0.500% per annum, in each case, depending on our leverage ratio and (b) the facility fee will be 0.200% or 0.250%. Our revolving credit facility contains a number of affirmative and restrictive covenants including limitations on the ability to place liens on our or our direct or indirect subsidiaries assets; to merge, consolidate, and dissolve; to sell assets; to engage in transactions with affiliates; to change our or our direct or indirect subsidiaries fiscal year or organizational documents; and to make restricted payments. Our revolving credit facility also requires us to meet Leverage Ratio and Secured Funded Debt Ratio financial covenants in each case measured quarterly as defined in our revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility contains certain covenants, including financial covenants that limit our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of Adjusted Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the revolving credit facility) to not more than 4.5 to 1, and limit our Secured Funded Debt Ratio (consisting of the ratio of Secured Funded Debt to Property and Equipment, each as defined in the revolving credit facility), to not more than 0.30 to 1. Our outstanding Senior Notes do not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy all the covenants in our revolving credit facility and Senior Notes, and do not expect the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels, or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future. In January 2018, we refinanced our revolving credit facility. See Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements." 91 Table of Contents Letters of Credit We issue letters of credit either under the revolving credit facility or directly with financial institutions. We had $309 million and $230 million in letters of credit issued directly with financial institutions outstanding at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , respectively. These letters of credit had weighted average fees of 93 basis points and a range of maturity of up to three years at December 31, 2017 . Other Indebtedness and Future Debt Maturities Excluding the $1,196 million of Senior Notes, all other third-party indebtedness at December 31, 2017 was $255 million . At December 31, 2017 , $11 million of our outstanding debt will mature in the following 12 months. We believe we will have adequate liquidity, including our capacity to borrow under our revolving credit facility, and/or the ability to execute on refinancing or new issuances of debt to meet requirements for scheduled maturities. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 : Payments Due by Period Total 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter Debt (1) $ 1,934 $ 83 $ 278 $ 68 $ 318 $ 54 $ 1,133 Capital lease obligations (1) 17 2 2 2 2 2 7 Operating lease obligations 629 36 42 39 36 35 441 Purchase obligations 37 37 Other long-term liabilities (2) 425 2 2 1 1 1 418 Total contractual obligations $ 3,042 $ 160 $ 324 $ 110 $ 357 $ 92 $ 1,999 (1) Includes principal and interest payments; assumes constant foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2017 for floating rate debt and international debt. (2) Primarily consists of deferred compensation plan liabilities; excludes $107 million in long-term tax positions due to the uncertainty related to the timing of the reversal of those positions . Guarantee Commitments The following table summarizes our guarantee commitments at December 31, 2017 : Amount of Guarantee Commitments Expiration by Period Total amounts committed 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter Performance guarantees (1) $ 323 $ 77 $ 40 $ 173 $ 5 $ 5 $ 23 Debt repayment and other guarantees (2) 708 140 25 504 39 Total guarantee commitments $ 1,031 $ 217 $ 65 $ 677 $ 44 $ 5 $ 23 (1) Consists of contractual agreements with third-party owners which require us to guarantee payments to the owners if specified levels of operating profit are not achieved by their hotels. (2) Consists of various debt repayment and other guarantees related to our unconsolidated hospitality ventures, managed and franchised hotels, and other properties. Certain of these underlying debt agreements have extension periods which are not reflected in the table above. With respect to certain of these debt repayment guarantees we have agreements with either our unconsolidated hospitality venture partner, the respective hotel owners, or other third parties which reduce our maximum guarantee which are not reflected in the table above . See Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements." 92 Table of Contents Investment Commitments The following table summarizes our investment commitments, which represent our commitment to fund contract acquisition costs and other investments such as unconsolidated hospitality ventures, at December 31, 2017 : Amount of Investment Commitments Expected Funding by Period Total amounts committed 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter Investment commitments $ 452 $ 216 $ 202 $ 3 $ 2 $ 12 $ 17 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2017 included purchase obligations of $37 million , letters of credit of $309 million and surety bonds of $25 million . These amounts are discussed in " Sources and Uses of Cash Revolving Credit Facility and Letters of Credit", " Contractual Obligations" and Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements." Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods, and the related disclosures in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. A number of our accounting policies, which are described in Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements," are critical due to the fact they involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates. Those accounting policies and other critical estimates are included below. As a result, these accounting policies could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. While we have used our best estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period. In addition, changes in the accounting estimates that we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. Although we believe our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors. Guarantees We enter into performance guarantees related to certain hotels we manage. We also enter into debt repayment and other guarantees with respect to our unconsolidated hospitality ventures, certain managed or franchised hotels, and other properties. Upon inception of the guarantee, we record a stand ready to perform liability that is measured at fair value. In order to estimate fair value, we use a Monte Carlo simulation to model the probability of possible outcomes. We are required to make certain assumptions and judgments in our determination of the fair value, which are based on our knowledge of the hospitality industry, market conditions, location of the property, and specific information available at the time of the valuation. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually during the fourth quarter using balances at October 1 and at an interim date, if indications of impairment exist. The Company has eight reporting units which have goodwill at December 31, 2017 . We are required to apply judgment when determining whether or not indications of impairment exist. The determination of the occurrence of a triggering event is based on our knowledge of the hospitality industry, historical experience, location of the property or properties, market conditions, and specific information available at the time of the assessment. We realize, however, that the results of our analysis could vary from period to period depending on how our judgment is applied and the facts and circumstances available at the time of the analysis. Judgment is also required in determining the assumptions and estimates use when calculating the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible. Historically, changes in estimates used in the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles impairment valuations have not resulted in material impairment charges in subsequent periods as a result of changes in those estimates. However, changes in 93 Table of Contents the economic and operating conditions impacting the assumptions and estimates could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our earnings. At December 31, 2017, a change in our assumptions and estimates that could reduce the fair value of each of our reporting units or indefinite-lived brand intangibles by 10% would not result in an impairment. In periods which are close to an acquisition, we would expect fair value to approximate carrying value and do not consider this to be indicative of an impairment risk, absent other factors. Business Combinations Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. We use judgment to determine the fair value of the property or business acquired and to determine the amount of value to allocate to each identifiable asset or liability. Typically, tangible assets acquired include property and equipment, and intangible assets acquired may include a management agreement intangible, a brand intangible, advanced bookings, and goodwill. Changes to the significant assumptions or factors used to determine fair value could affect the measurement and allocation of fair value. Property and Equipment and Definite-Lived Intangibles We evaluate property and equipment and definite-lived intangibles for impairment quarterly. We use judgment to determine whether indications of impairment exist. The determination of the occurrence of a triggering event is based on our knowledge of the hospitality industry, historical experience, location of the property, market conditions, and property-specific information available at the time of the assessment. We realize, however, that the results of our analysis could vary from period to period depending on how our judgment is applied and the facts and circumstances available at the time of the analysis. When a triggering event occurs, judgment is also required in determining the assumptions and estimates to use within the recoverability analysis and when calculating the fair value of the asset or asset group, if applicable. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting the judgments used could result in impairments to our long-lived assets in future periods, which could be material to our earnings. Historically, changes in estimates used in the property and equipment and definite-lived intangibles impairment assessment process have not resulted in material impairment charges in subsequent periods as a result of changes made to those estimates. Available For Sale ("AFS") Debt Securities See Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements" for our assessment process and further information regarding our estimates used in determining the fair value of AFS debt securities. Unconsolidated Hospitality Ventures We assess investments in unconsolidated hospitality ventures for impairment quarterly. We use judgment to determine whether or not there is an indication that a loss in value has occurred and whether a decline is deemed to be other than temporary. The determination of whether a loss in value has occurred is based on our knowledge of the hospitality industry, historical experience, location of the underlying venture property, market conditions, and venture-specific information available at the time of the assessment. When there is an indication that a loss in value has occurred, judgment is also required in determining the assumptions and estimates to use when calculating the fair value. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these estimates and judgments could result in impairments to our investments in unconsolidated hospitality ventures in future periods. Historically, changes in estimates used in the unconsolidated hospitality ventures impairment assessment process have not resulted in material impairment charges in subsequent periods as a result of changes made to those estimates. Income Taxes Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). In addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result of recently enacted U.S. tax legislation, we recorded an estimated tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2017 in relation to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets at the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate and the additional tax expense associated with the deemed repatriation tax. Additionally, we recorded a valuation allowance against foreign tax credits which we anticipate will no longer be realizable based upon the taxation of foreign earnings under the new tax legislation. 94 Table of Contents The impact of the new U.S. tax legislation has been recorded in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 118. In accordance with SAB 118, we are required to recognize the income tax effects of those aspects of the new legislation for which the accounting is complete. To the extent our accounting for certain income tax effects of the new legislation is incomplete, but we are able to determine a reasonable estimate, we must record a provisional estimate in our consolidated financial statements. If we cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in our consolidated financial statements, we should continue to apply our accounting treatment on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the new legislation. The provisional expenses as they relate to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets, deemed repatriation tax, and valuation allowance against foreign tax credits recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 may be subject to adjustments in subsequent periods throughout 2018 as a result of potential amendments, technical corrections, and further interpretation and implementation of the new legislation. We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return to determine whether they are "more likely than not" of being sustained assuming that the tax reporting positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements. If the position drops below the "more likely than not" standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the "more likely than not" standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. A change in the assessment of the "more likely than not" standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. For information regarding the impact of the newly enacted tax legislation and the provisional estimates recorded for 2017, see Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements." Insurance Our insurance reserves are accrued based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims that occurred during the covered period, which includes claims incurred but not reported, for which we will be responsible. These estimates are prepared with the assistance of outside actuaries and consultants. Actual cost of claims may differ from our original estimates and could result in a material change to our liability. Loyalty Program Future Redemption Obligation We utilize an actuary to assist with our estimate of our future redemption obligation related to the World of Hyatt loyalty program. Changes in the estimates used in the determination of the future redemption obligation, including the estimated cost per point and the estimate of the "breakage" for points that will never be redeemed, could result in a material change to our future redemption obligation. At December 31, 2017 , the redemption liability related to the loyalty program was $469 million . A 10% decrease in the breakage assumption would have resulted in an increase in the redemption liability of approximately $45 million at December 31, 2017 . Future Adoption of Accounting Standards See Part IV, Item 15, "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements" for the Company's current evaluation of the impact of adopting Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 ("ASU 2014-09"), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and other accounting standards effective in future periods.
