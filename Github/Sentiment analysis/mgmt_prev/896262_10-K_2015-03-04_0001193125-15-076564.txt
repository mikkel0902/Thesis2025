ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis provides information we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition for 2014, 2013 and 2012. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and Part I, Item 1, Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following analysis contains forward-looking statements about our future revenues, operating results and expectations. See Special Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the risks, assumptions and uncertainties affecting these statements as well as Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. Overview We are a provider of high-quality, low-cost home health services to the chronic, co-morbid, aging American population, with approximately 82%, 84% and 82% of our revenue derived from Medicare for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our operations involve servicing patients through our two reportable business segments: home health and hospice. Our home health segment delivers a wide range of services in the homes of individuals who may be recovering from an illness, injury or surgery. Our hospice segment provides care that is designed to provide comfort and support for those who are facing a terminal illness. As of December 31, 2014, we owned and operated 316 Medicare-certified home health care centers and 80 Medicare-certified hospice care centers in 34 states within the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 2014 Developments Entered into and paid $150 million settlement agreement to resolve U.S. Department of Justice investigation and Stark Law Self-Referral matter (described below in this Item 7 under the heading Governmental Inquiries and Investigations and Other Litigation ). Amended our senior secured Credit Agreement. Entered into a second lien Credit Agreement. Reduced debt balance and DOJ obligation by $79 million. Began beta testing of AMS3. Exited 63 care centers (11 sold). Returned to profitability in second quarter of 2014. Board of Directors named Paul B. Kusserow as President, Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors. 2015 Outlook Estimated no change in home health reimbursement. Preparation for compliance with the 10 th revision of the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD-10 ). Focus on managed care contract portfolio. Renewed focus on potential acquisitions. Executive Leadership As previously mentioned, William F. Borne stepped down from his position as Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and member of the Board of Directors during February 2014. As a result of his departure, Ronald A. 33 Table of Contents LaBorde moved from his role as President and Chief Financial Officer to President and Interim Chief Executive Officer. Dale E. Redman, the Company Chief Financial Officer from 2007 2011 was named Interim Chief Financial Officer. On December 16, 2014, the Board of Directors named Paul. B. Kusserow as President and Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors. Ronald A. LaBorde remains a member of senior management in the role of Vice Chairman. Dale E. Redman continues to serve in the role of Interim Chief Financial Officer. Care Center Closures/Consolidations As part of our ongoing management of our portfolio of care centers, we review each care center current financial performance, market penetration, forecasted market growth and the impact of proposed CMS payment revisions. Once we decide to close a care center, we first determine whether we can consolidate the care center with a care center servicing the same market. If a consolidation is not viable, we evaluate whether we have the opportunity to sell the care center. As a result of this process, we exited 63 care centers during 2014. The details are as follows: Home Health Hospice Sold Closed Consolidated Total Sold Closed Consolidated Total Quarter Ended March 31, 2014 1 4 4 9 1 1 Quarter Ended June 30, 2014 6 18 18 42 4 3 4 11 7 22 22 51 4 4 4 12 Additionally, we exited our one hospice inpatient unit during the three months ended September 30, 2014. For the care centers that we closed and consolidated, we recorded non-cash charges of $2.2 million in other intangibles impairment expense related to the write-off of intangible assets, $2.1 million in other general and administrative expenses related to lease termination costs and $2.1 million in salaries and benefits related to severance costs during 2014. In conjunction with the closure and consolidation of care centers, we restructured our regional leadership and corporate support functions. As such, we recorded charges of $3.4 million in salaries and benefits related to severance costs during 2014. In addition, on February 20, 2014, William F. Borne stepped down from his positions as Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and a member of our Board of Directors and we recorded charges of $2.3 million in salaries and benefits related to severance costs. Owned and Operated Care Centers Home Health Hospice At December 31, 2011 439 87 Acquisitions/Startups 4 14 Closed/Consolidated (8 ) (4 ) At December 31, 2012 435 97 Acquisitions 2 1 Closed/Consolidated/Sold (70 ) (6 ) At December 31, 2013 367 92 Closed/Consolidated/Sold (51 ) (12 ) At December 31, 2014 316 80 When we refer to same store business, we mean home health and hospice care centers that we have operated for at least the last twelve months; when we refer to acquisitions, we mean home health and hospice care centers that we acquired within the last twelve months; and when we refer to start-ups, we mean home health 34 Table of Contents or hospice care centers opened by us in the last twelve months. Once a care center has been in operation for a twelve month period, the results for that particular care center are included as part of our same store business from that date forward. Non-Medicare revenue, admissions, recertifications or completed episodes, includes home health revenue, admissions, recertifications or completed episodes of care for those payors that pay on an episodic or per visit basis, which includes Medicare Advantage programs and private payors. Economic and Industry Factors Home health and hospice services are a highly fragmented, highly competitive industry. The degree of competiveness varies depending upon whether our care centers operate in states that require a certificate of need (CON) or permit of approval (POA). In such states, expansion by existing providers or entry into the market by new providers is permitted only where determination is made by state health authorities that a given amount of unmet need exists. Currently, 70% and 40% of our home health and hospice care centers, respectively operate in CON/POA states. As the Federal government continues to debate a reduction in expenditures and a reform of the Medicare system, our industry continues to face reimbursement pressures. Specifically, the industry has been impacted by a 2% sequestration payment reduction beginning April 1, 2013. In addition to the sequestration cut, CMS instituted a rebasing cut of approximately $81 (2.7%) per year for 2014 2017; however, we do expect some offset from a market basket updated in each of these years. The following payment adjustments are effective for 2015 based on CMS final rules relative to Medicare reimbursement: Home Health(1) Hospice(2) Market Basket Update 2.60 % 2.90 % Rebasing (2.82 )% PPACA Adjustment (0.30 ) Productivity Adjustment (0.50 )% (0.50 )% Budget Neutrality Adjustment Factor 0.42 % (0.70 )% (0.30 )% 1.40 % (1) Our impact could differ depending on differences in the wage index and coding changes. Our 2015 pricing is expected to be relatively unchanged from 2014. (2) Effective for services provided from October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015. Governmental Inquiries and Investigations and Other Litigation On September 27, 2010, we received a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) issued by the U.S. Department of Justice pursuant to the federal False Claims Act. The CID required the delivery of a wide range of documents and information relating to the Company clinical and business operations, including reimbursement and billing claims submitted to Medicare for home health services, and related compliance activities. The CID generally covered the period from January 1, 2003. On April 26, 2011, we received a second CID related to the CID issued in September 2010, which generally covered the same time period as the previous CID and required the production of additional documents. Such CIDs are often associated with previously filed qui tam actions, or lawsuits filed under seal under the False Claims Act ( FCA ), 31 U.S.C. 3729 et seq. Qui tam actions are brought by private plaintiffs suing on behalf of the federal government for alleged FCA violations. Subsequently, the Company and certain current and former employees received additional CIDs for additional documents and/or testimony. In May 2012, we made a disclosure to CMS under the agency Stark Law Self-Referral Disclosure Protocol relating to certain services agreements between a subsidiary of ours and a large physician group (the Stark Law Self-Referral Matter ). During some period of time since December 2007, the arrangements appear not to have 35 Table of Contents complied in certain respects with an applicable exemption to the Stark Law referral prohibition. Medicare revenue earned as a result of referrals from the physician group from May 2008 to May 2012, the relevant four year lookback period under the Stark Law Self-Referral Disclosure Protocol, was approximately $4 million. On January 11, 2013, one of our subsidiaries received a CID from the United States Attorney Office for the Northern District of Georgia seeking certain information relating to that subsidiary relationship with this physician group On April 23, 2014, with no admission of liability on our part, we entered into a settlement agreement to resolve both the U.S. Department of Justice investigation and the Stark Law Self-Referral matter. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, on May 2, 2014, we paid the United States an initial payment in the amount of $116.5 million representing the first installment of $115 million plus interest thereon due under the settlement agreement, and on October 23, 2014, we paid the United States an additional payment in the amount of $35.8 million, representing the second and final installment of $35 million plus interest thereon due under the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement also resolves allegations made against us by various qui tam relators, who are required to dismiss their claims with prejudice. We accrued and paid various relators attorneys fees and expenses in the aggregate sum of approximately $3.9 million during 2014. In connection with the settlement agreement, on April 23, 2014, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement ( CIA ) with the Office of Inspector General-HHS. The CIA formalizes various aspects of our already existing ethics and compliance programs and contains other requirements designed to help ensure our ongoing compliance with federal health care program requirements. Among other things, the CIA requires us to maintain our existing compliance program, compliance committee and compliance committee of the Board of Directors; provide certain compliance training; continue screening new and current employees against certain lists to ensure they are not ineligible to participate in federal health care programs; engage an independent review organization to perform certain auditing and reviews and prepare certain reports regarding our compliance with federal health care programs, our billing submissions to federal health care programs and our compliance and risk mitigation programs; and provide certain reports and management certifications to the Office of Inspector General-HHS. Among other things, the CIA requires that we report substantial overpayments that we discover we have received from federal health care programs, as well as probable violations of federal health care laws. Upon breach of the CIA, we could become liable for payment of certain stipulated penalties, or could be excluded from participation in federal health care programs. The CIA has a term of five years. We expect the CIA to impact operating expenses by approximately $1 to $2 million annually beginning in 2015. See Item 8, Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our CIA and for a discussion of and updates regarding class action litigation we are involved in. No assurances can be given as to the timing or outcome of these items. 36 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated The following table summarizes our results from continuing operations (amounts in millions): For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Net service revenue $ 1,204.5 $ 1,249.3 $ 1,440.8 Gross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization 513.4 531.3 630.1 % of revenue 42.6 % 42.5 % 43.7 % Other operating expenses 486.3 526.8 576.9 % of revenue 40.4 % 42.2 % 40.0 % U.S. Department of Justice settlement 150.0 Goodwill and other intangibles impairment charge 3.1 9.5 162.1 Operating income (loss) 24.0 (155.0 ) (108.9 ) Total other income (expense), net (3.1 ) 1.5 (6.4 ) Income tax (expense) benefit (7.7 ) 58.8 20.0 Effective income tax rate 36.6 % (38.3 %) (17.4 %) Income (loss) from continuing operations 13.3 (94.7 ) (95.3 ) Net loss from discontinued operations (0.2 ) (3.1 ) (3.3 ) Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.3 ) 1.6 15.0 Net income (loss) attributable to Amedisys, Inc. $ 12.8 $ (96.2 ) $ (83.6 ) Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013 During the first quarter of 2014, we committed to a plan to consolidate 21 operating home health care centers and four operating hospice care centers with care centers servicing the same markets and close 23 home health care centers and six hospice care centers. As a result of this exit activity, we reduced our regional leadership structure and corporate support functions. Separate from the restructuring costs, we also recorded severance costs associated with the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer, a charge for relator fees associated with our U.S. Department of Justice settlement during the first quarter of 2014 and a non-cash other intangibles impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2014. The following details the costs associated with these activities (amounts in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Home Health Hospice Corporate Total Total Severance(a) $ 2.0 $ 0.1 $ $ 2.1 $ Restructuring severance 2.1 0.6 3.0 5.7 Lease terminations 1.9 0.2 2.1 Other intangibles impairment 1.6 1.5 3.1 9.5 Exit and restructuring activities cost 7.6 2.4 3.0 13.0 9.5 U.S. Department of Justice Settlement/Relator Fees 3.9 3.9 150.0 Total $ 7.6 $ 2.4 $ 6.9 $ 16.9 $ 159.5 (a) Includes $0.8 million and $0.1 million for severance included in cost of service for home health and hospice, respectively. 37 Table of Contents Our operating results have been impacted by the sale, closure and consolidation of 54 care centers mentioned above as well as the closure of an additional 9 care centers since December 31, 2013. Additionally, 76 care centers were exited during 2013. Accordingly, our results for the year ended December 31, 2014 are not fully comparable to the year ended December 31, 2013. Our operating income, excluding the $17 million in costs noted above and the U.S. Department of Justice settlement and the goodwill and other intangibles impairment charge in 2013, increased $36 million as our home health operating income increased $27 million, our hospice operating income increased $5 million and corporate expenses decreased $4 million. Additionally, the first quarter of 2013 was not impacted by sequestration as it was not in effect until April 1, 2013. The estimated impact of sequestration was $21 million for 2014 compared to $18 million in 2013. Income tax expense for 2014 and 2013 includes a favorable adjustment of $2 million related to various tax credits for state employment and training and state and federal research development. Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Our 2013 results were impacted by an accrual of $150 million and recognition of a deferred tax benefit of $56 million for the tentative settlement to resolve both the U.S. Department of Justice investigation and the Stark Law Self-Referral matter recorded during the third quarter. See Item 8, Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. During 2012, we recorded a $162 million impairment charge of goodwill and other intangibles as a result of the decline in our market capitalization and forecasts. We recognized a deferred tax benefit of $37 million as a result of the impairment charges during 2012. Our operating income, excluding the $150 million U.S. Department of Justice settlement and the goodwill and other intangibles impairment charges in 2013 and 2012, declined $48 million which is inclusive of an $18 million impact due to sequestration. Excluding the impact of sequestration, our home health operating income decreased $31 million, hospice operating income decreased $8 million and corporate expenses decreased $9 million. Our home health and hospice operating income declined primarily as a result of lower volumes with our home health operations experiencing an additional impact related to lower revenue per episode. Our corporate expense decrease is comprised of a $9 million decrease in professional and legal fees and travel and training expenses. In addition, other income increased $8 million primarily as a result of insurance proceeds for the reimbursement of legal expenses related to our litigation activities and a decrease in interest expense. Income tax expense includes a favorable adjustment of approximately $2 million related to a net increase in the statutory tax rate from 39.0% to 39.5% for 2013. In addition to the $37 million deferred tax benefit discussed above, tax expense for 2012 includes a favorable adjustment of $2 million related to various credits for state employment and training and state and federal research and development. 38 Table of Contents Home Health Division The following table summarizes our home health segment results from continuing operations: For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Financial Information (in millions): Medicare $ 751.5 $ 803.8 $ 915.3 Non-Medicare 205.4 183.9 236.8 Net service revenue 956.9 987.7 1,152.1 Cost of service 559.4 578.9 661.4 Gross margin 397.5 408.8 490.7 Other operating expenses 292.8 325.3 361.9 Operating income before impairment (1) $ 104.7 $ 83.5 $ 128.8 Key Statistical Data: Medicare: Same Store Volume (2): Revenue 1 % (10 %) (7 %) Admissions 0 % 0 % 0 % Recertifications 1 % (18 %) (8 %) Total (3): Admissions 175,476 188,566 192,375 Recertifications 102,263 107,908 134,515 Completed episodes 271,217 290,780 317,346 Visits 4,794,609 5,177,976 6,076,170 Average revenue per completed episode (4) $ 2,827 $ 2,817 $ 2,867 Average revenue per episode including sequestration (5) $ 2,770 $ 2,775 $ 2,867 Visits per completed episode (6) 17.3 17.5 18.8 Non-Medicare: Same Store Volume (2): Revenue 19 % (20 %) 18 % Admissions 17 % (13 %) 28 % Recertifications 13 % (24 %) 11 % Total (3): Admissions 83,759 76,551 90,017 Recertifications 32,074 30,304 41,268 Visits 1,651,745 1,531,781 2,011,684 Total (3): Cost per Visit $ 86.77 $ 86.27 $ 81.78 Visits 6,446,354 6,709,757 8,087,854 (1) Operating income of $103.1 million, $75.0 million and operating loss of $32.8 million on a GAAP basis for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. (2) Same store Medicare and Non-Medicare revenue, admissions or recertifications growth is the percent increase (decrease) in our Medicare and Non-Medicare revenue, admissions or recertifications for the period as a percent of the Medicare and Non-Medicare revenue, admissions or recertifications of the prior period. (3) Based on continuing operations for all periods presented. (4) Average Medicare revenue per completed episode is the average Medicare revenue earned for each Medicare completed episode of care which excludes the impact of sequestration. (5) Average Medicare revenue per completed episode including sequestration is the average Medicare revenue earned for each Medicare completed episode of care which includes the impact of sequestration. (6) Medicare visits per completed episode are the home health Medicare visits on completed episodes divided by the home health Medicare episodes completed during the period. 39 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Overall, our operating income, excluding the $8 million in exit activity costs in 2014 and the impairment charge in 2013, increased $27 million on an $11 million decline in gross margin offset by a $38 million decline in other operating expenses. Net Service Revenue Our Medicare revenue decline of approximately $52 million consisted of $53 million due to lower volumes and $2 million due to sequestration offset by a $3 million increase related to revenue per episode. The decrease in volumes is primarily due to the sale, closure and consolidation of 51 care centers since December 31, 2013, as we experienced an increase in same store revenue and recertifications. Our non-Medicare revenue increased $21 million which is primarily due to increases in volumes and an increase in our revenue per visit. We are experiencing significant growth in our non-Medicare business as we have focused on contract payors with significant concentrations in our markets. As mentioned above, we have closed numerous care centers since December 31, 2013. Accordingly, our results are not fully comparable to prior year. The following table summarizes our net service revenue for our operating care centers and those care centers that were closed, consolidated or sold. For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Revenue (in millions) : Operating care centers $ 941.2 $ 895.6 $ 1,012.3 Closed/Consolidated/Sold care centers 15.7 92.1 139.8 Net service revenue 956.9 987.7 1,152.1 Cost of Service, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization Our cost of service, excluding the $1 million in exit activity costs in 2014, decreased $20 million primarily as a result of our decrease in Medicare volumes which was offset by a 8% increase in non-Medicare visits as our cost per visit remained relatively flat. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses, excluding the $7 million in exit activity costs in 2014 and the impairment charge in 2013, decreased $38 million due to a $43 million decrease in other care center related expenses as a result of our closure and consolidation strategy and the reduction in divisional leadership; the majority of the reductions were in salaries and benefits, rent expense and travel costs offset by a $5 million increase in our provision for doubtful accounts due to the increase in non-Medicare revenue. Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Overall, our operating income excluding the goodwill and other intangibles impairment charge declined $45 million on a $164 million decline in revenue. Sequestration impacted revenue and operating income by $14 million. Both Medicare and non-Medicare gross margin were impacted by lower volumes offset by a $37 million decrease in other operating expenses. 40 Table of Contents Net Service Revenue Our Medicare revenue decline of approximately $111 million consisted of $82 million due to lower volumes, $15 million due to lower revenue per episode and $14 million due to sequestration. The volume decline is primarily due to a 20% decline in recertifications, as admissions only declined 2%. Our revenue per episode declined 2%; however, this was offset by a 7% decrease in our visits per episode. Our non-Medicare revenue decreased $53 million which is primarily due to a decline in admission volumes and the number of visits performed. A key driver in the volume decline is changes effective October 2012 in the terms of our Humana contract (episodic to per-visit reimbursement and reduction in market coverage). Cost of Service, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization Our cost of service decreased $82 million primarily as a result of our decrease in admission and recertification volumes and visits per episode offset by an increase in cost per visit. The increase in cost per visit is the result of wage inflation, increase in health and other benefits and the impact of lower visits due to the fixed nature of some of our care delivery costs. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses, excluding the goodwill and other intangibles impairment charge, decreased $37 million with $30 million attributed primarily to salary and wages and other care center related expenses. Our strategy to consolidate care centers within overlapping markets is a major factor in this decrease. The remaining $7 million is primarily the result of a reduction in our provision for doubtful accounts, which is reflective of our decrease in non-Medicare revenue and our higher percentage of contracted payors. Hospice Division The following table summarizes our hospice segment results from continuing operations: For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Financial Information (in millions): Medicare $ 232.6 $ 246.4 $ 272.7 Non-Medicare 15.0 15.2 16.0 Net service revenue 247.6 261.6 288.7 Cost of service 131.7 139.1 149.3 Gross margin 115.9 122.5 139.4 Other operating expenses 61.9 72.5 77.2 Operating income before impairment(1) $ 54.0 $ 50.0 $ 62.2 Key Statistical Data: Same store Medicare revenue growth(2) (2 %) (9 %) 13 % Same store Non-Medicare revenue growth(2) 6 % (3 %) 3 % Hospice admits 17,081 18,335 18,999 Average daily census 4,618 4,964 5,406 Revenue per day $ 146.93 $ 144.43 $ 145.89 Cost of service per day $ 77.93 $ 76.45 $ 75.34 Average length of stay 100 100 99 (1) Operating income of $52.5 million, $49.0 million and $61.7 million on a GAAP basis for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. (2) Same store Medicare and Non-Medicare revenue growth is the percent increase in our Medicare and Non-Medicare revenue for the period as a percent of the Medicare and Non-Medicare revenue of the prior period. 41 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Overall, our operating income, excluding the $2 million in exit activity costs in 2014 and the impairment charge in 2013, increased $5 million on a $14 million decline in revenue, an $8 million decline in cost of service and an $11 million decline in other operating expenses. Net Service Revenue Our hospice revenue decreased $14 million, primarily as the result of a decrease in our average daily census. The decrease in average daily census is primarily due to the sale, closure and consolidation of 12 care centers since December 31, 2013. The decrease in revenue was offset by a $2 million decrease in our hospice cap expense as our decline in average daily census and a decrease in admissions has resulted in a decrease in our overall cap expense. We benefitted from a 1.0% hospice rate increase effective October 1, 2013, and beginning October 1, 2014, the fiscal year 2015 hospice base rate increased approximately 1.4%. As mentioned above, we have closed numerous care centers since December 31, 2013. Accordingly, our results are not fully comparable to prior year. The following table summarizes our net service revenue for our operating care centers and those care centers that were closed, consolidated or sold. For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Revenue (in millions) : Operating care centers $ 243.4 $ 243.7 $ 264.6 Closed/Consolidated/Sold care centers 4.2 17.9 24.1 Net service revenue 247.6 261.6 288.7 Cost of Service, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization Our hospice cost of service decreased $8 million, or 5%, as the result of a 7% decrease in average daily census offset by an increase in cost of service per day. Our cost of service per day has been negatively impacted by an increase in pharmacy costs as a result of new CMS guidance which became effective on May 1, 2014. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses, excluding the $2 million in exit activity costs in 2014 and the impairment charge in 2013, decreased $11 million due to a $7 million decrease in other care center related expenses due to our care center closure and consolidation strategy and a $4 million decrease in our provision for doubtful accounts. Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Our operating income, excluding the goodwill and other intangibles impairment charge, decreased $12 million primarily due to a decrease in admissions which resulted in a lower average daily census. Net Service Revenue Our hospice revenue decreased $27 million, primarily as the result of a decrease in our average daily census and $4 million due to sequestration. We benefitted from a 0.9% hospice rate increase effective October 1, 2012 and beginning October 1, 2013, the fiscal year 2014 hospice base rate increased approximately 1%. 42 Table of Contents Cost of Service, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization Our hospice cost of service decreased $10 million, or 7%, which corresponds to our 8% decrease in average daily census. Our hospice clinicians are generally paid on a salaried basis, and our care centers are staffed based on their average census. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses, excluding the goodwill and other intangibles impairment charge, decreased $5 million due to a $7 million decrease in salaries and wages and other care center related expenses, offset by a $2 million increase in our provision for doubtful accounts due to an increase in non-Medicare write-offs during 2013. Corporate The following table summarizes our corporate results from continuing operations: For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Financial Information (in millions): Other operating expenses $ 114.4 $ 104.5 $ 113.3 Depreciation and amortization 17.2 24.5 24.5 Total before U.S. Department of Justice settlement (1) $ 131.6 $ 129.0 $ 137.8 (1) Total of $279.0 million on a GAAP basis for the year ended December 31, 2013. Corporate expenses consist of cost relating to our executive management and corporate and administrative support functions that are not directly attributable to a specific segment. Corporate and administrative support functions represent primarily information services, accounting, finance, billing and collections, legal, compliance, risk management, procurement, marketing, clinical administration, training, human resources and administration. Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Excluding the 2014 exit and restructuring activities costs and relator fees associated with our U.S. Department of Justice settlement agreement and the U.S. Department of Justice settlement in 2013, corporate expenses decreased $4 million primarily due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization. Our corporate salaries and wages experienced an increase due to the addition of resources for the roll-out of AMS3, our enhanced point of care system. Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Excluding the U.S. Department of Justice settlement in 2013, corporate expenses decreased $9 million primarily due to decreases in travel and training costs and legal and professional fees. 43 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (amounts in millions): For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (65.5 ) $ 102.3 $ 69.5 Cash used in investing activities (14.3 ) (46.5 ) (60.0 ) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities 70.5 (53.0 ) (43.0 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (9.3 ) 2.8 (33.5 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 17.3 14.5 48.0 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 8.0 $ 17.3 $ 14.5 Cash used in operating activities increased $167.8 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the payment of the U.S. Department of Justice Settlement. Adjusting for the $152.3 million settlement payment, we have generated $86.8 million in cash from operating activities during 2014. Cash provided by operating activities increased $32.8 million during 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to a 9.4 day decrease in our days revenue outstanding which increased our cash flow from operations by $32.5 million. For additional information regarding our operating performance and our days revenue outstanding, see Results of Operations and Outstanding Patient Accounts Receivable , respectively. The recognition of the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $162.1 million, which resulted in the net loss for 2012 is a non-cash item and therefore had no impact on our cash flow from operations. Cash used in investing activities decreased $32.2 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures of $29.7 million, primarily related to AMS3 development, and a $3.7 million decrease in the purchase of investments. Cash used in investing activities decreased $13.5 million during 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to a decrease in acquisition activities, purchases of property and equipment and proceeds from the sale of care centers of $22.5 million offset by the purchase of investments of $10.1 million. Cash provided by financing activities increased $123.5 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in our borrowings on our revolving line of credit and our Second Lien Loan. We increased our outstanding long-term obligations, net of repayments by $71.1 million from December 31, 2013, primarily to fund the U.S. Department of Justice settlement payment. Cash used in financing activities increased by $10.0 million during 2013 compared to 2012 due to an $11.4 million increase in our principal payments of long-term obligations, net of borrowings. Liquidity Typically, our principal source of liquidity is the collection of our patient accounts receivable, primarily through the Medicare program. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we have experienced reimbursement reductions due to sequestration and the 2012 CMS rate cut, as well as lower recertification volumes which have impacted our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In order to mitigate the impact of reimbursement reductions, we have executed a strategy to reduce the number of operating care centers and restructure our regional leadership and corporate support functions. This strategy has improved our operational performance; however, we did incur $12 million in closure and severance related costs which impacted our net income and cash flow. Additionally, CMS proposed to reduce reimbursement rates by 2.7% for rebasing in each year from calendar year 2015 to calendar year 2017; however, we do expect some offset from a market basket update. The impact of the 2015 payment adjustment is estimated to be minimal. For additional information regarding our reimbursement changes, see Overview Economic and Industry Factors . In addition 44 Table of Contents to our collection of patient accounts receivable, from time to time, we can and do obtain additional sources of liquidity by the incurrence of additional indebtedness or through sales of equity. During 2014, we spent $7.0 million in routine capital expenditures compared to $6.5 million and $21.1 million during 2013 and 2012, respectively. Routine capital expenditures primarily include equipment and computer software and hardware. In addition, we spent $5.0 million in non-routine capital expenditures related to enhancements to our point of care software compared to $35.2 million and $27.2 million during 2013 and 2012. Our routine and non-routine capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be approximately $10.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively. On April 23, 2014, we entered into a settlement agreement to resolve both the U.S. Department of Justice investigation and the Stark Law Self-Referral matter. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, on May 2, 2014, we paid the United States an initial payment in the amount of $116.5 million, representing the first installment of $115 million plus interest thereon due under the settlement agreement, and on October 23, 2014, we paid the United States an additional payment in the amount of $35.8 million, representing the second and final installment of $35 million plus interest thereon due under the settlement agreement. On July 28, 2014, we entered into a Second Lien Credit Agreement providing for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $70.0 million and amended our existing senior secured Credit Agreement dated as of October 26, 2012. The proceeds of the Second Lien Credit Agreement were used to pay down a portion of our Revolving Credit Facility. Separately, on July 28, 2014, we entered into the fourth amendment to our Credit Agreement which amends our existing Credit Agreement dated as of October 26, 2012, to add certain covenants, representations and other provisions in the Credit Agreement to, among other things, allow for our entry into the Second Lien Credit Agreement. The fourth amendment also decreases the aggregate principal amount of the revolving credit facility under our existing senior secured Credit Agreement from up to $165.0 million to up to $120.0 million. As of December 31, 2014, we had $8.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $85.7 million in availability under our $120.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Based on our operating forecasts and our new debt service requirements, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, capital requirements and debt service requirements; however, our ongoing ability to comply with the debt covenants under our credit agreement depends largely on the achievement of adequate levels of operating performance and cash flow. We routinely review our capital requirements to make sure that we have a capital structure in place that meets the current and future needs of the Company. If our future operating performance and/or cash flows are less than expected, it could cause us to default on our financial covenants in the future. In the event we are not in compliance with our debt covenants in the future, we would pursue various alternatives in an attempt to successfully resolve the non-compliance, which might include, among other things, seeking debt covenant waivers or amendments. There can be no assurance that debt covenant waivers or amendments would be obtained, if needed. Outstanding Patient Accounts Receivable Our patient accounts receivable, net decreased $11.8 million from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014. Our cash collection as a percentage of revenue was 103.2% and 107.2% for December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our days revenue outstanding, net at December 31, 2014 was 29.4 days which is a decrease of 2.7 days from December 31, 2013. Our patient accounts receivable includes unbilled receivables and are aged based upon our initial service date. At December 31, 2014, our unbilled patient accounts receivable, as a percentage of gross patient accounts receivable, was 35.9%, or $41.9 million, compared to 34.7%, or $44.8 million, at December 31, 2013. We monitor unbilled receivables on a care center by care center basis to ensure that all efforts are made to bill claims within timely filing 45 Table of Contents deadlines. The timely filing deadline for Medicare is one year from the date the episode was completed and varies by state for Medicaid-reimbursable services and among insurance companies and other private payors. Our provision for estimated revenue adjustments (which is deducted from our service revenue to determine net service revenue) and provision for doubtful accounts were as follows for the periods indicated (amounts in millions). We fully reserve for both our Medicare and other patient accounts receivable that are aged over 365 days. For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Provision for estimated revenue adjustments (1) $ 5.1 $ 9.4 Provision for doubtful accounts (2) 16.4 16.4 Total $ 21.5 $ 25.8 As a percent of revenue 1.8 % 2.0 % (1) Includes $0.1 million and $0.4 million from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. (2) Includes $0.1 million and $0.6 million from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The following schedules detail our patient accounts receivable, net of estimated revenue adjustments, by payor class, aged based upon initial date of service (amounts in millions, except days revenue outstanding, net): 0-90 91-180 181-365 Over 365 Total At December 31, 2014: Medicare patient accounts receivable, net (1) $ 62.1 $ 6.3 $ $ $ 68.4 Other patient accounts receivable: Medicaid 9.1 1.4 0.7 0.4 11.6 Private 23.4 5.4 2.5 2.3 33.6 Total $ 32.5 $ 6.8 $ 3.2 $ 2.7 $ 45.2 Allowance for doubtful accounts (2) (14.3 ) Non-Medicare patient accounts receivable, net $ 30.9 Total patient accounts receivable, net $ 99.3 Days revenue outstanding, net (3) 29.4 0-90 91-180 181-365 Over 365 Total At December 31, 2013: Medicare patient accounts receivable, net (1) $ 66.7 $ 8.7 $ $ $ 75.4 Other patient accounts receivable: Medicaid 11.4 2.6 1.3 0.3 15.6 Private 19.8 8.0 3.9 2.6 34.3 Total $ 31.2 $ 10.6 $ 5.2 $ 2.9 $ 49.9 Allowance for doubtful accounts (2) (14.2 ) Non-Medicare patient accounts receivable, net $ 35.7 Total patient accounts receivable, net $ 111.1 Days revenue outstanding, net (3) 32.1 46 Table of Contents (1) The following table summarizes the activity and ending balances in our estimated revenue adjustments (amounts in millions), which is recorded to reduce our Medicare outstanding patient accounts receivable to their estimated net realizable value, as we do not estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts for our Medicare claims. For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Balance at beginning of period $ 3.9 $ 6.4 Provision for estimated revenue adjustments (a) 5.1 9.4 Write offs (5.9 ) (11.9 ) Balance at end of period $ 3.1 $ 3.9 (a) Includes $0.1 million and $0.4 million from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our estimated revenue adjustments were 4.3% and 4.9% of our outstanding Medicare patient accounts receivable at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. (2) The following table summarizes the activity and ending balances in our allowance for doubtful accounts (amounts in millions), which is recorded to reduce only our Medicaid and private payer outstanding patient accounts receivable to their estimated net realizable value. For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Balance at beginning of period $ 14.2 $ 21.0 Provision for doubtful accounts (a) 16.4 16.4 Write offs (16.3 ) (23.2 ) Balance at end of period $ 14.3 $ 14.2 (a) Includes $0.1 million and $0.6 million from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 respectively. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was 31.6% and 28.5% of our outstanding Medicaid and private patient accounts receivable at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. (3) Our calculation of days revenue outstanding, net is derived by dividing our ending net patient accounts receivable (i.e., net of estimated revenue adjustments and allowance for doubtful accounts ) at December 31, 2014 and 2013 by our average daily net patient revenue for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Indebtedness Credit Agreement On July 28, 2014, we entered into the fourth amendment to our Credit Agreement which amends our existing Credit Agreement dated as of October 26, 2012, to add certain covenants, representations and other provisions in the Credit Agreement to, among other things, allow for our entry into the Second Lien Credit Agreement and gain operational flexibility in terms of financial covenants and uses of capital. The original credit agreement provided for senior unsecured facilities in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $225 million (the Credit Facilities ). The Credit Facilities are comprised of (a) a term loan facility in an initial aggregate principal amount 47 Table of Contents of $60 million (the Term Loan ); and (b) a revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $165 million (the Revolving Credit Facility), that was downsized to $120 million upon entering into the fourth amendment. The Term Loan began amortizing December 31, 2012, in 20 equal quarterly installments of $3.0 million (subject to adjustment for prepayments), with the remaining balance due upon maturity. The final maturity of the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility is October 26, 2017. The interest rate in connection with the Credit Facilities as amended on July 28, 2014, shall be selected from the following by us: (i) the ABR Rate plus the Applicable Margin (the Base Rate Advance ) or (ii) the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin (the Eurodollar Rate Advance ). The ABR Rate means the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% per annum and (c) the Eurodollar Rate for an interest period of one month plus 1% per annum. The Eurodollar Rate means the rate at which Eurodollar deposits in the London interbank market for an interest period of one, two, three or six months (as selected by us) are quoted. The Applicable Margin is based on the total leverage ratio and is presented in the table below. As of December 31, 2014, the Applicable Margin is 1.75% per annum for Base Rate Advances and 2.75% per annum for Eurodollar rate advances. We are also subject to a commitment fee under the terms of the Credit Facilities, as presented in the table below. Total Leverage Ratio Margin for ABR Loans Margin for Eurodollar Loans Commitment Fee 2.50 2.25 % 3.25 % 0.50 % < 2.50 and 2.00 2.00 % 3.00 % 0.50 % < 2.00 and 1.50 1.75 % 2.75 % 0.50 % < 1.50 1.50 % 2.50 % 0.45 % Our weighted average interest rate for our five year $60.0 million Term Loan, under our existing senior secured Credit Agreement was 3.4% for 2014 and 2.8% for 2013. Our weighted average interest rate for our $120.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, as amended by the fourth amendment to our Credit Agreement, was 3.4% for 2014. Our existing senior secured Credit Agreement, as amended on July 28, 2014, as well as the Second Lien Credit Agreement requires us to meet three financial covenants including limiting total leverage and senior secured leverage and requiring minimum coverage of fixed charges. Total leverage is a ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) and senior secured leverage is a ratio of total senior secured debt to EBITDA. The final covenant is a fixed charge coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA plus rent expense ( EBITDAR ) (less capital expenditures less cash taxes) to scheduled debt repayments plus interest expense plus rent expense. These thresholds vary over the term of the credit facility. As of December 31, 2014, our total leverage ratio was 1.5, our senior secured leverage ratio was 0.7 and our fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.3 and we are in compliance with the existing senior secured Credit Agreement. In the event we are not in compliance with our debt covenants in the future, we would pursue various alternatives in an attempt to successfully resolve the non-compliance, which might include, among other things, seeking debt covenant waivers or amendments. Pursuant to the Security Agreement, as of the effective date of the Fourth Amendment, the Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of our and our wholly-owned subsidiaries non-real estate assets (subject to exceptions for certain immaterial subsidiaries), including all of the stock of our wholly-owned subsidiaries that are corporations, equity interests in our wholly-owned subsidiaries that are not corporations, our equity interests in our joint ventures and our investments. If an event of default occurs under the Credit Agreement, the Agent may, upon the request of a specified percentage of the Lenders, exercise remedies with respect to the collateral, including, in some instances, taking possession of or selling personal property assets, collecting accounts receivables, or exercising proxies to take control of the pledged stock and other equity interests. 48 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2014, our availability under our $120.0 million Revolving Credit Facility as amended by the fourth amendment to our existing senior secured Credit Agreement, was $85.7 million as we had $19.3 million outstanding in letters of credit. Second Lien Credit Agreement On July 28, 2014, we entered into a Second Lien Credit Agreement ( Second Lien Agreement ) providing for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $70.0 million. The Agreement is among Amedisys Holding, L.L.C., as Co-Borrower, Amedisys, Inc., as Lead Borrower, the several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties thereto as lenders (the Second Lien Lenders ) and Cortland Capital Markets LLC, as Administrative Agent for the Second Lien Lenders (the Second Lien Agent ). Various wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Guarantors ) guaranteed our obligations under the Second Lien Agreement. In connection therewith, we, Amedisys Holding, L.L.C. and the Guarantors also entered into a Second Lien Security Agreement dated as of July 28, 2014 (the Second Lien Security Agreement ) with the Second Lien Agent for the purpose of securing the payment of our obligations under the Second Lien Agreement. The proceeds of the Second Lien Agreement of $68.3 million were used to pay off a portion of the revolving credit balances under our existing senior secured Credit Agreement dated as of October 26, 2012 and related costs. The final maturity date of the term loan under the Second Lien Agreement is July 28, 2020. There is no amortization associated with the Second Lien Agreement, with the full $70.0 million due at final maturity. A prepayment penalty in the amount of 2.0% of the prepaid principal is required if the payment is made on or prior to the first anniversary of the agreement date. A prepayment penalty in the amount of 1.0% of the prepaid principal is required if the payment is made on or prior to the second year anniversary of the agreement date. There is no prepayment penalty during the remaining life of the loan. The interest rate in connection with the Second Lien Agreement shall be selected from the following by us: (i) the ABR Rate plus 6.50% or (ii) the Eurodollar Rate plus 7.50%. The ABR Rate means the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% per annum, (c) the Eurodollar Rate for an interest period of one month plus 1% per annum, or (d) 2%. The Eurodollar Rate is based upon the rate at which Eurodollar deposits in the London interbank market for an interest period of one, two, three or six months (as selected by us) are quoted with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%. Our weighted average interest rate for our Second Lien Loan under the Second Lien Credit Agreement was 8.5% for 2014. Contractual Obligations and Medicare Liabilities Our future contractual obligations and Medicare liabilities at December 31, 2014 were as follows (amounts in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 Years Long-term obligations $ 118.0 $ 12.0 $ 36.0 $ $ 70.0 Interest on long-term obligations (1) 36.4 7.3 13.3 11.9 3.9 Operating leases (2) 50.4 20.4 23.2 6.5 0.3 Capital commitments 5.7 5.7 Purchase obligations 12.1 5.3 5.8 1.0 Medicare liabilities 1.1 1.1 Uncertain tax positions 4.0 4.0 $ 227.7 $ 55.8 $ 78.3 $ 19.4 $ 74.2 49 Table of Contents (1) Interest on debt with variable rates was calculated using the current rate of that particular debt instrument at December 31, 2014. (2) Operating lease obligations for our discontinued operation locations amounted to $0.3 million at December 31, 2014. Critical Accounting Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, collectability of accounts receivable, reserves related to insurance and litigation, goodwill, intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies. We base these estimates on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results experienced may vary materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations may be affected. We believe the following critical accounting policies represent our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition We earn net service revenue through our home health and hospice care centers by providing a variety of services almost exclusively in the homes of our patients. This net service revenue is earned and billed either on an episode of care basis, on a per visit basis or on a daily basis depending upon the payment terms and conditions established with each payor for services provided. We refer to home health revenue earned and billed on a 60-day episode of care as episodic-based revenue. When we record our service revenue, we record it net of estimated revenue adjustments and contractual adjustments to reflect amounts we estimate to be realizable for services provided, as discussed below. We believe, based on information currently available to us and based on our judgment, that changes to one or more factors that impact the accounting estimates (such as our estimates related to revenue adjustments, contractual adjustments and episodes in progress) we make in determining net service revenue, which changes are likely to occur from period to period, will not materially impact our reported consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or our future financial results. Home Health Revenue Recognition Medicare Revenue Net service revenue is recorded under the Medicare prospective payment system ( PPS ) based on a 60-day episode payment rate that is subject to adjustment based on certain variables. We make adjustments to Medicare revenue on completed episodes to reflect differences between estimated and actual payment amounts, and our discovered inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations and other reasons unrelated to credit risk. We estimate the impact of such adjustments based on our historical experience, which primarily includes a historical collection rate of over 99% on Medicare claims, and record this estimate during the period in which services are rendered as an estimated revenue adjustment and a corresponding reduction to patient accounts receivable. In addition, management evaluates the potential for revenue adjustments and, when appropriate, provides allowances based upon the best available information. 50 Table of Contents In addition to revenue recognized on completed episodes, we also recognize a portion of revenue associated with episodes in progress. Episodes in progress are 60-day episodes of care that begin during the reporting period, but were not completed as of the end of the period. We estimate this revenue on a monthly basis based upon historical trends. The primary factors underlying this estimate are the number of episodes in progress at the end of the reporting period, expected Medicare revenue per episode and our estimate of the average percentage complete based on visits performed. Non-Medicare Revenue Episodic-based Revenue. We recognize revenue in a similar manner as we recognize Medicare revenue for episodic-based rates that are paid by other insurance carriers, including Medicare Advantage programs; however, these rates can vary based upon the negotiated terms. Non-episodic Based Revenue. Gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established or estimated per-visit rates, as applicable. Contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between our standard rates and the contracted rates to be realized from patients, third parties and others for services provided and are deducted from gross revenue to determine net service revenue and are also recorded as a reduction to our outstanding patient accounts receivable. Hospice Revenue Recognition Hospice Medicare Revenue Gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to the estimated payment rates. The estimated payment rates are daily or hourly rates for each of the four levels of care we deliver. We make adjustments to Medicare revenue for our discovered inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations and other reasons unrelated to credit risk. We estimate the impact of these adjustments based on our historical experience, which primarily includes our historical collection rate on Medicare claims, and record it during the period services are rendered as an estimated revenue adjustment and as a reduction to our outstanding patient accounts receivable. Additionally, as Medicare hospice revenue is subject to an inpatient cap limit and an overall payment cap for each provider number, we monitor these caps and estimate amounts due back to Medicare if a cap has been exceeded. We record these adjustments as a reduction to revenue and an increase in other accrued liabilities. We have settled our Medicare hospice reimbursements for all fiscal years through October 31, 2012 as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, we have recorded $2.8 million for estimated amounts due back to Medicare in other accrued liabilities for the Federal cap years ended October 31, 2013 through October 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2013, we had recorded $4.0 million for estimated amounts due back to Medicare in other accrued liabilities for the Federal cap years ended October 31, 2012 through October 31, 2014. Hospice Non-Medicare Revenue We record gross revenue on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established rates or estimated per visit rates, as applicable. Contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between our established rates and the amounts estimated to be realizable from patients, third parties and others for services provided and are deducted from gross revenue to determine our net service revenue and patient accounts receivable. Patient Accounts Receivable Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Our patient accounts receivable are uncollateralized and consist of amounts due from Medicare, Medicaid, other third-party payors and patients. We fully reserve for accounts which are aged at 365 days or greater. We write off accounts on a monthly basis once we have exhausted our collection efforts and deem an account to be 51 Table of Contents uncollectible. We do not record an allowance for doubtful accounts for our Medicare patient accounts receivable, which are recorded at their net realizable value after recording estimated revenue adjustments as discussed above. We believe there is a certain level of credit risk associated with non-Medicare payors. To provide for our non-Medicare patient accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future, we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated net realizable value. We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of historical and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in payment and an evaluation of collectability based upon the date that the service was provided. Based upon our best judgment, we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for accounts that will not be collected due to credit risk. Insurance We are obligated for certain costs associated with our insurance programs, including employee health, workers compensation and professional liability. While we maintain various insurance programs to cover these risks, we are self-insured for a substantial portion of our potential claims. We recognize our obligations associated with these costs in the period in which a claim is incurred, including with respect to both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported, up to specified deductible limits. These costs have generally been estimated based on historical data of our claims experience. Such estimates, and the resulting reserves, are reviewed and updated by us on a quarterly basis. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. These events or circumstances include but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business environment; regulatory environment or legal factors; or a substantial decline in market capitalization of our stock. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a two-step impairment test. In the first step of the test, the fair values of the reporting units are compared to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would proceed to step two of the test. In step two of the test, the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined by a hypothetical allocation of the fair value calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was reflective of the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess, if any, of the calculated fair value after hypothetical allocation to the reporting unit assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is greater than the carrying amount of the goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is not impaired and the analysis is complete. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is deemed impaired by the amount of that variance. We calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units using discounted cash flows as well as a market approach that compares our reporting units earnings and revenue multiples to those of comparable public companies. To determine fair value we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, in particular expected organic growth rates, future Medicare reimbursement rates, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates. Our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to our business model or changes in operating performance. These factors increase the risk of differences between projected and actual performance that could impact future 52 Table of Contents estimates of fair value of all reporting units. Significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could result in additional impairment in future periods. Each of our operating segments described in the notes to our financial statements is considered to represent an individual reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. We consider each of our home health care centers to constitute an individual business for which discrete financial information is available. However, since these care centers have substantially similar operating and economic characteristics and resource allocation and significant investment decisions concerning these businesses are centralized and the benefits broadly distributed, we have aggregated these care centers and deemed them to constitute a single reporting unit. We have applied this same aggregation principle to our hospice care centers and have also deemed them to be a single reporting unit. During 2014, we did not record any goodwill impairment charges and none of the goodwill associated with our various reporting units were considered at risk of impairment as of October 31, 2014. Since the date of our last annual goodwill impairment test, there have been no material developments, events, changes in operating performance or other circumstances that would cause management to believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units would be less than its carrying amount. Intangible assets consist of Certificates of Need, licenses, acquired names, non-compete agreements and reacquired franchise rights. We amortize non-compete agreements, acquired names that we do not intend to use in the future and reacquired franchise rights on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is generally three years for non-compete agreements and up to five years for reacquired franchise rights and acquired names. During step one of our annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that the fair value of certain intangible assets was less than the carrying value and as a result recognized a non-cash other intangibles impairment charge of $0.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2014. These impairments did not have any impact on our compliance with our debt covenants or on our cash flows. Income Taxes We use the asset and liability approach for measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences existing at each balance sheet date using currently enacted tax rates. Our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about future operations. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect of a change in tax rate is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 our deferred tax assets were $122.4 and $145.5 million, respectively. Management regularly assesses the ability to realize deferred tax assets recorded in the Company entities based upon the weight of available evidence, including such factors as the recent earnings history and expected future taxable income. In the event future taxable income is below management estimates or is generated in tax jurisdictions different than projected, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase in our effective tax rate.
