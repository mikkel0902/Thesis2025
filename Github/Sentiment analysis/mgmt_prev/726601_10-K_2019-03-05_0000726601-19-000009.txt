BUSINESS OVERVIEW Our Business We are a financial holding company headquartered in Tallahassee, Florida, and we are the parent of our wholly owned subsidiary, Capital City Bank (the Bank or CCB ). We offer a broad array of products and services, including commercial and retail banking services, trust and asset management, and retail securities brokerage through a total of 59 banking offices located in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. Please see the section captioned About Us beginning on page 4 for more detailed information about our business. Our profitability, like most financial institutions, is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income, which is the difference between the interest and fees received on interest earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses, operating expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and other operating expenses including income taxes, and noninterest income such as deposit fees, wealth management fees, mortgage banking fees, and bank card fees. Strategic Review Our philosophy is to build long-term client relationships based on quality service, high ethical standards, and safe and sound banking practices. We maintain a locally oriented, community-based focus, which is augmented by experienced, centralized support in select specialized areas. Our local market orientation is reflected in our network of banking office locations, experienced community executives with a dedicated President for each market, and community boards which support our focus on responding to local banking needs. We strive to offer a broad array of sophisticated products and to provide quality service by empowering associates to make decisions in their local markets. 32 We have sought to build a franchise in small-to medium-sized, less competitive markets, located on the outskirts of the larger metropolitan markets where we are positioned as a market leader. Many of our markets are on the outskirts of these larger markets in close proximity to major interstate thoroughfares such as Interstates I-10 and I-75. Our three largest markets are Tallahassee (Leon County, Florida), Gainesville (Alachua County, Florida), and Macon (Bibb County, Georgia). In 13 of 18 markets in Florida and two of four markets in Georgia, we rank within the top four banks in terms of deposit market share. Furthermore, in the counties in which we operate, we maintain a 8.30% deposit market share in the Florida counties and 5.11% in the Georgia counties, suggesting that there is significant opportunity to grow market share within these geographic areas. The larger employers in many of our markets are state and local governments, healthcare providers, educational institutions, and small businesses. While we realize that the markets in our footprint do not provide for potential growth that the larger metropolitan markets may offer, we believe our markets do provide good growth dynamics and have historically grown in excess of the national average The value of these markets stems from the fact they are generally stable and less competitive, secondary markets. We strive to provide value added services to our clients by being not just their bank, but their banker. We believe this element of our strategy distinguishes Capital City Bank from our competitors. Our long-term vision remains to profitably expand our franchise through a combination of organic growth in existing markets and acquisitions. We have long understood that our core deposit funding base is a predominant driver of our profitability and overall franchise value, and have focused extensively on this component of our organic growth efforts in recent years. While we have not been an active acquirer of banks since 2005, this component of our strategy is still in place. When evaluating potential acquisition opportunities, we will continue to weigh the value of organic growth initiatives versus potential acquisition returns and pursue the strategies that we believe provide the best overall return to our shareowners. We will continue to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama with a particular focus on financial institutions located on the outskirts of larger, metropolitan areas. The primary areas that we are focusing on for expansion opportunities include Alachua, Marion, Hernando/Pasco counties in Florida, the western panhandle of Florida, and Bibb and surrounding counties in central Georgia. Our focus on some of these markets may change as we continue to evaluate our strategy and the economic conditions and demographics of any individual market. We will also continue to evaluate de novo expansion opportunities in attractive new markets where acquisition opportunities are not feasible. We may also evaluate expansion opportunities including asset management, mortgage banking, and other financial businesses that are closely aligned with the business of banking. Embedded in our acquisition strategy is our desire to partner with institutions that are culturally similar, have experienced management and possess either established market presence or have potential for improved profitability through growth, economies of scale, or expanded services. Generally, these potential target institutions will range in asset size from $100 million to $500 million. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 2018 again produced marked improvement in our financial performance moving us closer to our normal historical performance levels. Record loan growth, a rising rate environment, our strong core deposit base, and tax reform were all major contributors to earnings growth. Our net interest margin increased 27 basis points aided by our asset-sensitive balance sheet and our ability to manage our cost of funds. Average deposit balances grew 2.1% in 2018, our fifth consecutive year of growth, and have grown approximately $351 million, or 17% since 2013. For 2018, net income totaled $26.2 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, compared to net income of $10.9 million, or $0.64 per diluted share for 2017. Net income for 2018 included tax benefits totaling $3.3 million, or $0.19 per diluted share related to 2017 plan year pension plan contributions made during 2018. Net income in 2017 reflected a $4.1 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, income tax expense related to the tax reform act commonly known as Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ) enacted on December 22, 2017. Net income for 2018 was driven by higher net interest income of $9.5 million and an $8.8 million reduction in income tax expense, partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in noninterest expense, a $0.7 million increase in the loan loss provision, and lower noninterest income of $0.2 million. 33 Below are summary highlights that impacted our performance for the year: Continued improvement in operating leverage driven by margin expansion - Net interest income up $9.5 million, or 11.5% - Net interest margin up 27 basis points to 3.64% - Record average loan growth of $100 million, or 6.2% Average deposit growth of 2% (fifth consecutive year of growth) Continued reduction in classified assets of 28% Tangible capital ratio of 7.58% Tangible book value per share growth of 11% Repurchased 324,000 shares of common stock Dividend growth of 33% In 2018, we realized record loan growth driven by continued improvement in economic and business conditions in our markets. We again realized meaningful re-composition in our earning asset mix which drove strong growth in net interest income, up 11% over 2017 and our net interest margin which was up 27 basis points to 3.64%. For 2018, noninterest income declined $0.2 million, or 0.3%, however we made great strides toward stabilizing the downward trend in our noninterest income driven by lower deposit fees, specifically lower utilization of our overdraft service, and the discontinuance of our data processing business in 2016 and 2017. Several initiatives came to fruition in 2018 including the introduction of a new fee based checking account line-up in mid-2018 and improved utilization of our debit card product which drove improvement in service charges and interchange fees, respectively. Higher wealth management fees also contributed and reflected growth in assets under management. We continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance noninterest income, including leveraging our working capital finance platform to all of our markets, a supply chain finance service, and government guaranteed small business lending. Noninterest expense increased $2.1 million, or 1.9%, over 2017 primarily attributable to higher compensation expense of $1.6 million and occupancy expense of $0.7 million, partially offset by a $0.2 million decline in other expense. The primary drivers of the increase were higher performance based compensation reflective of our improved financial performance and professional fees related to a system conversion and profit enhancement projects that were complete at year-end. Overall asset quality continued to improve in 2018 as nonperforming and classified asset levels declined by 18% and 28%, respectively. Our ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets was 0.31% at December 31, 2018 compared to 0.38% at December 31, 2017. Loan losses remained low in 2018 at 12 basis points of average loans. We continue to focus on and implement strategic initiatives that enhance long-term shareowner value and believe we are well positioned to continue improving our operating leverage and returning to our historical norm of profitability. Key components of our 2018 financial performance are summarized below: Results of Operations For 2018, tax-equivalent net interest income increased $9.0 million, or 10.6%, to $93.2 million driven by higher interest rates and a favorable shift in the earning asset mix. Higher rates were earned on overnight funds, investment securities and loans, partially offset by a higher cost on our negotiated rate deposits. Our net interest margin of 3.64% in 2018 increased 27 basis points over 2017 and reflected a 39 basis point increase in the earning asset yield that was partially offset by a 12 basis point increase in the cost of funds. For 2018, our loan loss provision was $2.9 million compared to $2.2 million for 2017 with the increase driven by growth in the loan portfolio. At December 31, 2018, our allowance for loan losses of $14.2 million represented 0.80% of outstanding loans (net of overdrafts) and provided coverage of 207% of nonperforming loans compared to 0.80% and 186%, respectively, at December 31, 2017. For 2018, noninterest income totaled $51.6 million, a $0.2 million, or 0.3%, decrease from 2017, and reflected lower mortgage banking fees of $1.0 million, partially offset by higher other income of $0.4 million and wealth management fees of $0.4 million. The lower level of mortgage banking fees reflected a lower level of loans sold in secondary market as adjustable rate loan production has picked up momentum and is being retained in our loan portfolio instead of sold on the secondary market. Total residential loan production (secondary market sales and portfolio) during 2018 was comparable to 2017. For 2018, noninterest expense totaled $111.5 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 1.9%, over 2017 attributable to higher compensation expense of $1.6 million and occupancy expense of $0.7 million, partially offset by lower other expense of $0.2 million. 34 Financial Condition Average assets totaled approximately $2.857 billion for 2018, an increase of $41.1 million, or 1.5%, over 2017. Average earning assets were approximately $2.562 billion for 2018, an increase of $59.7 million, or 2.4% over 2017. Year-over-year, average overnight funds decreased $54.6 million, while investment securities increased $14.5 million and average gross loans were higher by $99.8 million. Average gross loans totaled $1.718 billion in 2018, an increase of $99.8 million, or 6.2%, over 2017. Loans as a percentage of average earning assets increased to 67.1% in 2018 compared to 64.7% in 2017. We realized growth in all loan categories except home equity loans. A portion of the increase in 2018 was due to strategic loan pool purchases of approximately $26.1 million in adjustable residential real estate loans and fixed and adjustable rate commercial real estate loans. Average total deposits for 2018 were $2.423 billion, an increase of $51.1 million, or 2.2%, over 2017. The increase occurred in noninterest bearing and savings accounts, partially offset by the declines in the remaining product types. 2018 was the fifth consecutive year that we have realized growth in our average deposit balances. At December 31, 2018, our nonperforming assets (nonaccrual loans and OREO) totaled $9.1 million, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 18.0% from December 31, 2017. Nonaccrual loans totaled $6.9 million at December 31, 2018, a $0.3 million decrease from December 31, 2017. The balance of OREO totaled $2.2 million at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1.7 million from December 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets represented 0.31% of total assets at December 31, 2018 compared to 0.38% at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, our allowance for loan losses of $14.2 million represented 0.80% of outstanding loans (net of overdrafts) and provided coverage of 207% of nonperforming loans compared to 0.80% and 186%, respectively, at December 31, 2017. For 2018, our net loan charge-offs totaled $2.0 million, or 0.12%, of average loans, compared to $2.3 million, or 0.14%, for 2017. Shareowners equity increased by $18.4 million from $284.2 million at December 31, 2017 to $302.6 million at December 31, 2018. We continue to maintain a strong capital base as evidenced by a risk-based capital ratio of 17.13% and tangible common equity ratio of 7.58% at December 31, 2018 compared to 17.10% and 7.09%, respectively, at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, all of our regulatory capital ratios significantly exceeded the threshold to be well-capitalized. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For 2018, we realized net income of $26.2 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, compared to net income of $10.9 million, or $0.64 per diluted share for 2017, and $11.7 million, or $0.69 per diluted share in 2016. The increase in net income for 2018 was attributable to a $9.5 million increase in net interest income and an $8.8 million reduction in income tax expense, partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in noninterest expense, a $0.7 million increase in the loan loss provision, and lower noninterest income of $0.2 million. Income tax expense for 2018 reflected the favorable impact of the Tax Act, including a lower federal corporate tax rate and one-time discrete tax benefits totaling $3.3 million, or $0.19 per diluted share related to 2017 plan year pension contributions made during 2018. The decrease in net income for 2017 reflected higher income tax expense of $6.3 million, primarily due to discrete tax expense of $4.1 million related to the Tax Act, a $1.9 million decrease in noninterest income, and a $1.4 million increase in the loan loss provision, partially offset by higher net interest income of $5.0 million and a $3.8 million reduction in noninterest expense. 35 A condensed earnings summary for the last three years is presented in Table 1 below: Table 1 CONDENSED SUMMARY OF EARNINGS (Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Data) 2018 2017 2016 Interest Income $ 99,395 $ 86,930 $ 81,154 Taxable Equivalent Adjustments 654 1,226 1,011 Total Interest Income (FTE) 100,049 88,156 82,165 Interest Expense 6,891 3,948 3,189 Net Interest Income (FTE) 93,158 84,208 78,976 Provision for Loan Losses 2,921 2,215 819 Taxable Equivalent Adjustments 654 1,226 1,011 Net Interest Income After Provision for Loan Losses 89,583 80,767 77,146 Noninterest Income 51,565 51,746 53,681 Noninterest Expense 111,503 109,447 113,214 Income Before Income Taxes 29,645 23,066 17,613 Income Tax Expense 3,421 12,203 5,867 Net Income $ 26,224 $ 10,863 $ 11,746 Basic Net Income Per Share $ 1.54 $ 0.64 $ 0.69 Diluted Net Income Per Share $ 1.54 $ 0.64 $ 0.69 Net Interest Income Net interest income represents our single largest source of earnings and is equal to interest income and fees generated by earning assets, less interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities. We provide an analysis of our net interest income, including average yields and rates in Tables 2 and 3 below. We provide this information on a "taxable equivalent" basis to reflect the tax-exempt status of income earned on certain loans and investments. In 2018, our taxable equivalent net interest income increased $9.0 million, or 10.6%. This follows increases of $5.2 million, or 6.6% and $2.0 million, or 2.6%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The year-over-year increases generally resulted from growth in our loan and investment portfolios. In 2017 and 2018, the increase also reflected favorable repricing of our adjustable and variable rate earning assets, partially offset by an increase in our negotiated rate deposits. For 2018, taxable equivalent interest income increased $11.9 million, or 13.5%, over 2017. In 2017, taxable equivalent interest income increased $6.0 million, or 7.3%, over 2016. The increases in both comparisons were primarily due to higher balances in the loan and investment portfolios coupled with higher rates. Interest expense increased $2.9 million, or 74.5%, from 2017 to 2018, and increased $0.8 million, or 23.8%, from 2016 to 2017. The increase over both prior periods primarily reflected increases to our negotiated rate deposits which are tied to an adjustable rate index. Our cost of funds increased 11 basis points to 27 basis points in 2018 compared to 2017 and increased three basis points over 2016 to 16 basis points in 2017. The increased cost of funds over both prior periods was primarily due to higher interest rates paid on our negotiated rate products due to the recent rising interest rate environment. Our interest rate spread (defined as the taxable-equivalent yield on average earning assets less the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities) increased 18 basis points in 2018 compared to 2017 and increased nine basis points in 2017 compared to 2016. Our net interest margin (defined as taxable-equivalent interest income less interest expense divided by average earning assets) of 3.64% in 2018 was a 27 basis point increase over 2017. The net interest margin of 3.37% in 2017 was a 12 basis point increase over 2016. The increase in interest rate spread and net interest margin over both prior year periods is attributable to rising rates and an improving mix of earning assets driven by loan growth. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the federal funds target rate four times in 2018 to end the year with a target rate in the range of 2.25%-2.50%, which followed three rate increases in 2017. These rate increases have positively affected our net interest income due to favorable repricing of our variable and adjustable rate earning assets, and our asset sensitive balance sheet. Although these rate increases resulted in higher rates paid on our negotiated rate deposit products, we continue to monitor and manage our overall cost of funds. Despite highly competitive loan pricing across most markets, the yield of the overall loan portfolio has increased year-over-year. 36 We continue to review and implement various loan strategies that align with our overall risk appetite to enhance our performance. We continue to maintain short duration portfolios on both sides of the balance sheet and believe we are well positioned to respond to changing market conditions.

The increase in 2018 was driven by growth of our loan portfolio. The increase in 2017 reflected higher net loan charge-offs and growth of our loan portfolio. We discuss these trends in further detail below under Risk Element Assets and Allowance for Loan Losses. Noninterest Income For 2018, noninterest income totaled $51.6 million, a $0.2 million, or 0.3%, decrease from 2017, and reflected lower mortgage banking fees of $1.0 million, partially offset by higher other income of $0.4 million and wealth management fees of $0.4 million. The lower level of mortgage banking fees was due to a reduction in the volume of loans sold in secondary market as adjustable rate loan production picked up momentum and is being retained in our loan portfolio instead of sold on the secondary market. Total residential loan production (secondary market sales and portfolio) during 2018 was comparable to 2017. The increase in other income reflected higher signing bonus income from processing contracts and miscellaneous income. The increase in wealth management fees was attributable to higher trust fees and reflected growth in assets under management. 38 For 2017, noninterest income totaled $51.7 million, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 3.6%, from 2016 attributable to lower other income of $2.7 million and deposit fees of $1.0 million, partially offset by higher wealth management fees of $1.2 million and mortgage banking fees of $0.6 million. The decrease in other income was attributable to a $2.5 million gain from the partial retirement of our trust preferred securities in the second quarter of 2016. Lower fees related to data processing services provided to third parties also contributed to the decrease and reflected the discontinuance of this line of business over the past two years with our last client discontinuing service in the fourth quarter of 2017. The reduction in deposit fees reflected lower utilization of our overdraft service product. Growth in assets under management as well as improved sales efforts have resulted in strong growth in wealth management fees. Strong home sales in our markets and a growing market share of residential loan production drove the improvement in mortgage banking fees. Noninterest income as a percent of total operating revenues (net interest income plus noninterest income) was 35.79% in 2018, 38.41% in 2017, and 40.78% in 2016. The decline in this metric over the last three years was attributable to growth in net interest income as a component of operating revenues. The table below reflects the major components of noninterest income. (Dollars in Thousands) 2018 2017 2016 Deposit Fees $ 20,093 $ 20,335 $ 21,332 Bank Card Fees 11,378 11,191 11,221 Wealth Management Fees 8,711 8,284 7,029 Mortgage Banking Fees 4,735 5,754 5,192 Other 6,648 6,182 8,907 Total Noninterest Income $ 51,565 $ 51,746 $ 53,681 Various significant components of noninterest income are discussed in more detail below. Deposit Fees . For 2018, deposit fees (service charge fees, insufficient fund/overdraft fees ( NSF/OD ), and business account analysis fees) totaled $20.1 million compared to $20.3 million in 2017 and $21.3 million in 2016. The $0.2 million, or 1.2%, decrease in 2018 reflected lower NSF/OD fees that were significantly offset by higher service charge fees. In mid-2018, we introduced a new fee-based checking account line-up which has enhanced our service charge fees and stabilized our total deposit fee revenues. The decrease in 2017 was due to a lower level of NSF/OD fees attributable to a reduction in the number of accounts using our overdraft protection service and lower utilization by existing users reflecting improved financial management by our clients. Bank Card Fees . Bank card fees totaled $11.4 million in 2018 compared to $11.2 million in 2017 and 2016. We have implemented initiatives over the past three years aimed at stabilizing our bank card fee revenues and in 2018 realized growth. The aforementioned new checking account line-up introduced in mid-2018 will continue to have a favorable impact on this fee source as well as strategies aimed at acquiring new deposit relationships. Wealth Management Fees . Wealth management fees including both trust fees (i.e., managed accounts and trusts/estates) and retail brokerage fees (i.e., investment, insurance products, and retirement accounts) totaled $8.7 million in 2018 compared to $8.3 million in 2017 and $7.0 million in 2016. The growth in fees for both 2018 and 2017 was attributable to growth in assets under management. At December 31, 2018, total assets under management were approximately $1.500 billion compared to $1.418 billion at December 31, 2017 and $1.192 billion at December 31, 2016. Mortgage Banking Fees . Mortgage banking fees totaled $4.7 million in 2018 compared to $5.8 million in 2017 and $5.2 million in 2016. The decrease in 2018 was attributable to a reduction in the volume of loans sold in secondary market as adjustable rate loan production has picked up momentum and is being retained in our loan portfolio instead of sold on the secondary market. Total residential loan production (secondary market sales and portfolio) during 2018 was comparable to 2017. The increase in 2017 reflected trong home sales in our markets and a growing market share of residential loan production. Refinancing activity represented 11% of our loan production in 2018 and 2017compared to 20% for 2016. Market conditions, housing activity, the level of interest rates and the mix of our fixed-rate and variable rate production have significant impacts on our mortgage banking fees. 39 Other . Other noninterest income totaled $6.6 million in 2018 compared to $6.2 million in 2017 and $8.9 million in 2016. The $0.4 million, or 7.5%, increase over 2017 reflected higher signing bonus income from processing contracts that have been renegotiated and miscellaneous income. The decrease in 2017 was attributable to a $2.5 million gain from the partial retirement of our trust preferred securities in the second quarter of 2016. Lower fees related to data processing services provided to third parties also contributed to the decrease and reflected the discontinuance of this line of business over the two year period (2016-2017) with our last client discontinuing service in the fourth quarter of 2017. Noninterest Expense For 2018, noninterest expense totaled $111.5 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 1.9%, over 2017 attributable to higher compensation expense of $1.6 million and occupancy expense of $0.7 million, partially offset by lower other expense of $0.2 million. Higher salary expense, primarily cash incentives, drove the increase in compensation expense. Occupancy expense increased due to higher equipment/software maintenance agreement expense and to a lesser extent an increase in building maintenance costs (partly related to Hurricane Michael). The decrease in other expense was primarily attributable to lower OREO expense of $1.6 million, partially offset by higher professional fees of $1.3 million. Higher net gains from property sales drove the improvement in OREO expense. The increase in professional fees reflected costs associated with several consulting projects, including both profit enhancements projects and the upgrading of ancillary systems, all of which were complete at the end of the third quarter of 2018. For 2017, noninterest expense totaled $109.4 million, a decrease of $3.8 million, or 3.3%, from 2016 attributable to lower other expense of $2.9 million (primarily OREO, legal, and FDIC insurance), occupancy expense of $0.5 million, and compensation expense of $0.4 million. All OREO expense categories (gain/loss on sale, carrying costs, and valuation adjustments) declined as we continued efforts to liquidate our remaining properties. Legal and FDIC insurance expense declined as expected as these categories return closer to our historical norm, post-recession. The decrease in occupancy expense reflected our continuing efforts to optimize our banking office structure and operational processes. The decrease in compensation expense reflected lower salary expense of $1.2 million, partially offset by higher associate benefit expense of $0.8 million. Our operating efficiency ratio (expressed as noninterest expense as a percent of taxable equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income) was 77.05%, 80.50% and 85.34% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Improved operating leverage primarily attributable to growth in net interest income has driven the improvement for all respective years. Expense management is an important part of our culture and strategic focus. We will continue to review and evaluate opportunities to optimize our operations, reduce operating costs and manage our discretionary expenses. 40 The table below reflects the major components of noninterest expense.

Compensation . Compensation expense totaled $63.9 million in 2018, $62.3 million in 2017, and $62.7 million in 2016. For 2018, the $1.6 million, or 2.6%, increase over 2017 reflected higher salary expense of $1.7 million, partially offset by lower associate benefit expense of $0.1 million. A higher level of cash incentives which reflected improved financial performance drove a significant portion of the increase in salary expense. Slightly higher base salaries and contractual employment also contributed to the increase, but to a lesser extent. For 2017, the $0.4 million, or 0.7%, decrease from 2016 reflected lower salary expense of $1.2 million, partially offset by higher associate benefit expense of $0.8 million. Continued headcount attrition drove the decline in salary expense and the increase in associate benefit expense reflected higher pension plan expense attributable to utilization of a lower discount rate for plan liabilities and to a lesser extent higher associate insurance expense and stock compensation expense. Occupancy . Occupancy expense (including premises and equipment) totaled $18.5 million for 2018, $17.8 million for 2017, and $18.3 million for 2016. For 2018, the $0.7 million, or 3.7%, increase over 2017 was attributable to higher equipment/software maintenance agreement expense and to a lesser extent an increase in building maintenance costs (partly related to Hurricane Michael). For 2017, the $0.5 million, or 2.5%, decrease from 2016 generally reflected our continuing efforts to optimize our banking office structure and operational processes. Other . Other noninterest expense totaled $29.1 million in 2018, $29.3 million in 2017, and $32.2 million in 2016. For 2018, the $0.2 million, or 0.7%, decrease primarily reflected lower OREO expense of $1.6 million, partially offset by higher professional fees of $1.3 million. A higher level of net gains (higher gains of $1.2 million and lower losses of $0.2 million) from the sale of properties drove the reduction in OREO expense. During 2018, we sold a banking office in our Tallahassee market which resulted in a $2.0 million gain. The increase in professional fees reflected costs associated with several consulting projects, including both profit enhancements projects and the upgrading of ancillary systems, all of which were essentially complete at the end of the third quarter of 2018. 41 For 2017, the $2.9 million, or 9.0%, decrease was primarily attributable to lower OREO expense of $2.5 million, FDIC insurance fees of $0.4 million, and legal fees of $0.4 million. Lower valuation adjustments of $1.0 million, and net gains from the sale of properties of $1.4 million (higher gains of $0.6 million and lower losses of $0.8 million) drove the reduction in OREO expense. The reduction in FDIC insurance fees reflected a reduction in our premium. Legal expense declined due to a lower level of support needed for problem loan resolutions. Income Taxes For 2018, we realized income tax expense of $3.4 million (12% effective rate) compared to $12.2 million (53% effective rate) for 2017 and $5.9 million (33% effective rate) for 2016. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. Among other things, the Tax Act reduced our corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result, we were required to re-measure, through income tax expense, our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted rate at which we expect them to be recovered or settled. We recorded an adjustment in the amount of $4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the re-measurement of our deferred tax inventory. Income tax expense for 2017 also included a $0.3 million write-off of a deferred tax asset related to a cancelled stock award as well as income tax benefits of $0.2 million related to stock-based compensation awards. During 2018, income tax expense included four discrete tax benefit items totaling $3.6 million resulting from the effect of the Tax Act. Three discrete items totaling $3.3 million related to pension plan contributions made in 2018 for the plan year 2017. In addition, we realized a discrete tax item for $0.3 million related to a tax accounting method change, for a cost segregation and depreciation analysis for various properties we own which was filed with the extended 2017 tax return. Excluding discrete items, our effective tax rate was 24% for 2018 and 36% for 2017. Absent future discrete events, we anticipate that our effective tax will approximate 24%. FINANCIAL CONDITION Average assets totaled approximately $2.857 billion for 2018, an increase of $41.1 million, or 1.5%, over 2017. Average earning assets were approximately $2.562 billion for 2018, an increase of $59.7 million, or 2.4% over 2017. Year-over-year, average overnight funds decreased $54.6 million, while investment securities increased $14.5 million and average loans were higher by $99.8 million. We discuss these variances in more detail below. Table 2 provides information on average balances and rates, Table 3 provides an analysis of rate and volume variances and Table 4 highlights the changing mix of our interest earning assets over the last three years. Loans In 2018, average loans increased $99.8 million, or 6.2%, compared to an increase of $76.4 million, or 5.0%, in 2017. Loans as a percentage of average earning assets increased to 67.1% in 2018 compared to 64.7% in 2017 and 63.4% in 2016. Year-over-year average balances in the loan portfolio experienced increases in all loan categories except home equity loans. Over the course of 2018, we purchased both adjustable rate residential loans and fixed and adjustable rate commercial real estate loan pools totaling $26.1 million based on principal balances at the time of purchase. We continue to make minor modifications on some of our lending programs to try and mitigate the impact that consumer and business deleveraging has had on our portfolio. These programs, coupled with economic improvements in our anchor markets and loan purchases, have helped to increase overall loan growth. We originate mortgage loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties through our Residential Real Estate line of business, a majority of which are fixed-rate loans that are sold into the secondary market to third party purchasers on a best efforts delivery basis with servicing released. A majority of our adjustable rate loans are retained in our loan portfolio. 42 Table 4 SOURCES OF EARNING ASSET GROWTH 2017 to Percentage Components of 2018 Total Average Earning Assets (Average Balances Dollars In Thousands) Change Change 2018 2017 2016 Loans: Commercial, Financial, and Agricultural $ 1,729 2.9 % 8.7 % 8.8 % 8.5 % Real Estate Construction 19,438 32.6 3.3 2.6 2.1 Real Estate Commercial Mortgage 52,978 88.7 22.1 20.5 20.3 Real Estate Residential 19,814 33.2 13.2 12.7 12.5 Real Estate Home Equity (11,225) (18.8) 8.5 9.2 9.6 Consumer 17,031 28.6 11.3 10.9 10.4 Total Loans $ 99,765 167.2 % 67.1 % 64.7 % 63.4 % Investment Securities: Taxable $ 45,330 76.0 % 25.0 % 23.8 % 24.1 % Tax-Exempt (30,830) (51.7) 2.6 3.9 3.8 Total Securities 14,500 24.3 27.6 27.7 27.9 Funds Sold (54,612) (91.5) 5.3 7.6 8.7 Total Earning Assets $ 59,653 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Our average loan-to-deposit ratio increased to 70.9% in 2018 from 67.1% in 2017. The higher loan-to-deposit ratio reflects stronger growth in our average loan balances relative to the growth in average deposit balances. The composition of our loan portfolio at December 31 st for each of the past five years is shown in Table 5. Table 6 arrays our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018, by maturity period. As a percentage of the total portfolio, loans with fixed interest rates represented 38.6% as of December 31, 2018, compared to 37.2% on December 31, 2017. The higher ratio was primarily due to increases in fixed rate commercial mortgage and residential loans and, to a lesser extent, a decline in variable rate home equity lines of credit.

Risk Element Assets Risk element assets consist of nonaccrual loans, OREO, troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ), past due loans, potential problem loans, and loan concentrations. Table 7 depicts certain categories of our risk element assets as of December 31 st for each of the last five years. Activity within our nonperforming asset portfolio is provided below in Table 8. Nonperforming assets (nonaccrual loans and OREO) totaled $9.1 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $11.1 million at December 31, 2017. Nonaccrual loans totaled $6.9 million at December 31, 2018, a $0.3 million decrease from December 31, 2017. Nonaccrual loan additions totaled $12.2 million for 2018 compared to $14.1 million for 2017. The balance of OREO totaled $2.2 million at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1.7 million December 31, 2017. For 2018, we disposed of properties totaling $2.8 million compared to $7.5 million in 2017. Nonperforming assets represented 0.31% of total assets at December 31, 2018 compared to 0.38% at December 31, 2017. 44 Table 7 RISK ELEMENT ASSETS (Dollars in Thousands) 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 Nonaccruing Loans: Commercial, Financial and Agricultural $ 267 $ 629 $ 468 $ 96 $ 507 Real Estate Construction 722 298 311 97 424 Real Estate Commercial Mortgage 2,860 2,370 3,410 4,191 5,806 Real Estate Residential 2,119 1,938 2,330 4,739 6,737 Real Estate Home Equity 584 1,748 1,774 1,017 2,544 Consumer 320 176 240 165 751 Total Nonperforming Loans ( NPLs ) (1) $ 6,872 $ 7,159 $ 8,533 $ 10,305 $ 16,769 Other Real Estate Owned 2,229 3,941 10,638 19,290 35,680 Total Nonperforming Assets ( NPAs ) $ 9,101 $ 11,100 $ 19,171 $ 29,595 $ 52,449 Past Due Loans 30 89 Days $ 4,757 $ 4,543 $ 6,438 $ 5,775 $ 6,792 Past Due Loans 90 Days or More (accruing) - 36 - - - Performing Troubled Debt Restructurings $ 22,084 $ 32,164 $ 38,233 $ 35,634 $ 44,409 Nonperforming Loans/Loans 0.39 % 0.43 % 0.54 % 0.69 % 1.16 % Nonperforming Assets/Total Assets 0.31 0.38 0.67 1.06 2.00 Nonperforming Assets/Loans Plus OREO 0.51 0.67 1.21 1.94 3.55 Allowance/Nonperforming Loans 206.79 % 185.87 % 157.40 % 135.40 % 104.60 % (1) Nonaccrual TDRs totaling $2.6 million, $2.3 million, and $1.7 million are included in NPLs for December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

Nonaccrual loans totaled $6.9 million at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $0.3 million from December 31, 2017. Gross additions to nonaccrual status during 2018 totaled $12.2 million compared to $14.1 million in 2017. Generally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due or management deems the collectability of the principal and interest to be doubtful. Once a loan is placed in nonaccrual status, all previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized when the ultimate collectability is no longer considered doubtful. Loans are returned to accrual status when the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current or when future payments are reasonably assured. If interest on our loans classified as nonaccrual during 2018 had been recognized on a fully accruing basis, we would have recorded an additional $0.4 million of interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018. Other Real Estate Owned . OREO represents property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans or by receiving a deed in lieu of foreclosure. OREO is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure. Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses. On an ongoing basis, properties are either revalued internally or by a third party appraiser as required by applicable regulations. Subsequent declines in value are reflected as other noninterest expense. Carrying costs related to maintaining the OREO properties are expensed as incurred and are also reflected as other noninterest expense. OREO totaled $2.2 million at December 31, 2018 versus $3.9 million at December 31, 2017. During 2018, we added properties totaling $2.1 million, sold properties totaling $2.8 million, and recorded valuation adjustments totaling $1.0 million. For 2017, we added properties totaling $2.4 million, sold properties totaling $7.5 million, recorded valuation adjustments totaling $1.3 million, and miscellaneous adjustments totaling $0.3 million. The composition of our OREO portfolio as of December 31 is provided in the table below. (Dollars in Thousands) 2018 2017 Lots/Land $ 1,030 $ 2,435 Residential 1-4 655 187 Commercial Building 64 450 Other 480 869 Total OREO $ 2,229 $ 3,941 Troubled Debt Restructurings. TDRs are loans on which, due to the deterioration in the borrower financial condition, the original terms have been modified and deemed a concession to the borrower. From time to time we will modify a loan as a workout alternative. Most of these instances involve an extension of the loan term, an interest rate reduction, or a principal moratorium. A TDR classification can be removed if the borrower financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, and the loan is subsequently refinanced or restructured at market terms and qualifies as a new loan. Loans classified as TDRs at December 31, 2018 totaled $24.7 million compared to $34.5 million at December 31, 2017. Accruing TDRs made up approximately $22.1 million, or 89%, of our TDR portfolio at December 31, 2018 of which $0.5 million was over 30 days past due. The weighted average rate for the loans within the accruing TDR portfolio was 5.5%. During 2018, we modified 6 loan contracts totaling approximately $0.7 million. Our TDR default rate (default balance as a percentage of average TDRs) in 2017 and 2018 was 7% and 4%, respectively. 46 The composition of our TDR portfolio as of December 31 is provided in the table below. 2018 2017 (Dollars in Thousands) Accruing Nonaccruing (1) Accruing Nonaccruing (1) Commercial, Financial and Agricultural $ 873 $ - $ 822 $ - Real Estate Construction 59 - 64 - Real Estate Commercial Mortgage 9,910 1,239 17,058 1,636 Real Estate Residential 9,234 1,222 11,666 503 Real Estate Home Equity 1,920 179 2,441 186 Consumer 88 - 113 - Total TDRs $ 22,084 $ 2,640 $ 32,164 $ 2,325 (1) Nonaccruing TDRs are included in NPL totals and NPA/NPL ratio calculations.

A loan is defined as a past due loan when one full payment is past due or a contractual maturity is over 30 days past due. Past due loans at December 31, 2018 totaled $4.8 million compared to $4.6 million at December 31, 2017. Potential Problem Loans . Potential problem loans are defined as those loans which are now current but where management has doubt as to the borrower ability to comply with present loan repayment terms. At December 31, 2018, we had $4.0 million in loans of this type which were not included in either of the nonaccrual, TDR or 90 day past due loan categories compared to $1.9 million at December 31, 2017. Management monitors these loans closely and reviews their performance on a regular basis. Loan Concentrations . Loan concentrations exist when there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities which cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions and such amount exceeds 10% of total loans. Due to the lack of diversified industry within our markets and the relatively close proximity of the markets, we have both geographic concentrations as well as concentrations in the types of loans funded. Specifically, due to the nature of our markets, a significant portion of our loan portfolio has historically been secured with real estate, approximately 70% at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The primary types of real estate collateral are commercial properties and 1-4 family residential properties. At December 31, 2018, commercial real estate and residential real estate mortgage loans (including home equity loans) accounted for 33.9% and 33.1%, respectively, of the total loan portfolio. The following table summarizes our real estate loan portfolio as segregated by the type of property. Property type concentrations are stated as a percentage of December 31 st total real estate loans. 2018 2017 Investor Real Estate Owner Occupied Real Estate Investor Real Estate Owner Occupied Real Estate Vacant Land, Construction, and Land Development 11.0 % - 11.2 % - Improved Property 26.0 63.0 % 23.6 65.2 % Total Real Estate Loans 37.0 % 63.0 % 34.8 % 65.2 % A major portion of our real estate loan portfolio is centered in the owner occupied category which carries a lower risk of non-collection than certain segments of the investor category. Approximately 59% of the land/construction category was secured by residential real estate at December 31, 2018. 47 Allowance for Loan Losses We believe that we maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to provide for probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Credit losses arise from the borrowers inability or unwillingness to repay, and from other risks inherent in the lending process including collateral risk, operations risk, concentration risk, and economic risk. We consider all of these risks of lending when assessing the adequacy of our allowance. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision charged to expense. Loans are charged-off against the allowance when losses are probable and reasonably quantifiable. Our allowance for loan losses is based on management's judgment of overall credit quality, which is a significant estimate based on a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio. Our allowance can and will change based on revisions to our assessment of our loan portfolio's overall credit quality and other risk factors both internal and external to us. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis. The allowance consists of two components. The first component consists of amounts reserved for impaired loans. A loan is deemed impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the bank will not be able to collect all amounts due (principal and interest payments), according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans are monitored for potential impairment through our ongoing loan review procedures and portfolio analysis. Classified loans and past due loans over a specific dollar amount, and all troubled debt restructurings are individually evaluated for impairment. The approach for assigning reserves for the impaired loans is determined by the dollar amount of the loan and loan type. Impairment measurement for loans over a specific dollar are assigned on an individual loan basis with the amount reserved dependent on whether repayment of the loan is dependent on the liquidation of collateral or from some other source of repayment. If repayment is dependent on the sale of collateral, the reserve is equivalent to the recorded investment in the loan less the fair value of the collateral after estimated sales expenses. If repayment is not dependent on the sale of collateral, the reserve is equivalent to the recorded investment in the loan less the estimated cash flows discounted using the loan effective interest rate. The discounted value of the cash flows is based on the anticipated timing of the receipt of cash payments from the borrower. The reserve allocations for individually measured impaired loans are sensitive to the extent market conditions or the actual timing of cash receipts change. Impairment reserves for smaller-balance loans under a specific dollar amount are assigned on a pooled basis utilizing loss factors for impaired loans of a similar nature. The second component is a general reserve on all loans other than those identified as impaired. General reserves are assigned to various homogenous loan pools, including commercial, commercial real estate, construction, residential 1-4 family, home equity, and consumer. General reserves are assigned based on historical loan loss ratios determined by loan pool and internal risk ratings that are adjusted for various internal and external risk factors unique to each loan pool. Table 9 analyzes the activity in the allowance over the past five years. For 2018, our net loan charge-offs totaled $2.0 million, or 0.12%, of average loans, compared to $2.3 million, or 0.14%, for 2017, and $1.3 million, or 0.09%, for 2016. The slight decrease in 2018 reflected a higher level of loan loss recoveries as gross loan losses remained stable. The increase in 2017 was primarily attributable to a lower level of loan loss recoveries which fluctuate over time. At December 31, 2018, the allowance for loan losses of $14.2 million was 0.80% of outstanding loans (net of overdrafts) and provided coverage of 207% of nonperforming loans compared to 0.80% and 186%, respectively, at December 31, 2017, and 0.86% and 157%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Table 10 provides an allocation of the allowance for loan losses to specific loan types for each of the past five years. The allowance for loan losses totaled $14.2 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $13.3 million at December 31, 2017 and $13.4 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in 2018 reflected a $2.6 million increase in general reserves partially offset by a $1.7 million decrease in impaired loan reserves. Growth in our loan portfolio drove the increase in general reserves and lower impaired loan balances drove the reduction in impaired loan reserves. The slight decrease in 2017 was primarily attributable to a decline in general reserves due to favorable problem loan migration and improving risk factors within our loan portfolio. We believe our allowance at December 31, 2018 was adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. 48 Table 9 ANALYSIS OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES (Dollars in Thousands) 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 Balance at Beginning of Year $ 13,307 $ 13,431 $ 13,953 $ 17,539 $ 23,095 Charge-Offs: Commercial, Financial and Agricultural 644 1,357 861 1,029 871 Real Estate Construction 7 - - - 28 Real Estate Commercial 315 685 349 1,250 3,788 Real Estate Residential 780 411 899 1,852 2,160 Real Estate Home Equity 533 190 450 1,403 1,379 Consumer 2,395 2,193 2,127 1,901 1,820 Total Charge-Offs 4,674 4,836 4,686 7,435 10,046 Recoveries: Commercial, Financial and Agricultural 459 313 337 239 214 Real Estate Construction 26 50 - - 9 Real Estate Commercial 373 174 408 183 468 Real Estate Residential 643 616 1,231 705 752 Real Estate Home Equity 191 219 409 136 141 Consumer 964 1,125 960 992 1,001 Total Recoveries 2,656 2,497 3,345 2,255 2,585 Net Charge-Offs 2,018 2,339 1,341 5,180 7,461 Provision for Loan Losses 2,921 2,215 819 1,594 1,905 Balance at End of Year $ 14,210 $ 13,307 $ 13,431 $ 13,953 $ 17,539 Ratio of Net Charge-Offs to Average Loans Outstanding 0.12 % 0.14 % 0.09 % 0.35 % 0.53 % Allowance for Loan Losses as a Percent of Loans at End of Year 0.80 % 0.8 % 0.86 % 0.93 % 1.22 % Allowance for Loan Losses as a Multiple of Net Charge-Offs 7.04 x 5.69 x 10.02 x 2.69 x 2.35 x 49 Table 10 ALLOCATION OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 (Dollars in Thousands) Allow-ance Amount Percent of Loans in Each Category To Total Loans Allow-ance Amount Percent of Loans in Each Category To Total Loans Allow-ance Amount Percent of Loans in Each Category To Total Loans Allow-ance Amount Percent of Loans in Each Category To Total Loans Allow-ance Amount Percent of Loans in Each Category To Total Loans Commercial, Financial and Agricultural $ 1,434 13.1 % $ 1,191 13.2 % $ 1,198 13.8 % $ 905 12.0 % $ 784 9.5 % Real Estate: Construction 280 5.0 122 4.7 168 3.7 101 3.1 843 3.0 Commercial 4,181 33.8 4,346 32.3 4,315 32.1 4,498 33.2 5,287 35.4 Residential 3,400 19.6 3,206 19.1 3,445 18.6 4,409 20.0 6,520 21.1 Home Equity 2,301 11.8 2,506 13.8 2,297 15.0 2,473 15.6 2,882 15.9 Consumer 2,614 16.7 1,936 16.9 2,008 16.8 1,567 16.1 1,223 15.1 Total $ 14,210 100.0 % $ 13,307 100.0 % $ 13,431 100.0 % $ 13,953 100.0 % $ 17,539 100.0 % Investment Securities In 2018, our average investment portfolio balance increased $14.5 million, or 2.1%, from 2017 and increased $16.3 million, or 2.4%, from 2016 to 2017. As a percentage of average earning assets, our investment portfolio represented 27.6% in 2018, compared to 27.7% in 2017. In both 2017 and 2018, we strategically grew the portfolio to better deploy our liquidity. We currently believe a relatively short duration investment portfolio offers the flexibility to provide additional liquidity from maturing bonds, if necessary. In 2018, average taxable investments increased $45.3 million, or 7.6%, while tax-exempt investments decreased $30.8 million, or 31.5%. Non-taxable investments decreased as the tax-equivalent yield was generally unattractive throughout 2018 given the changes from the Tax Act in late 2017. We primarily purchased taxable investments as part of our overall investment strategy in 2018. High quality, short-term taxable bonds offered attractive yields during the year, resulting in favorable repricing in the investment portfolio. At December 31, 2018, municipal securities (taxable and non-taxable) comprised 7.4% of the portfolio. We may consider the purchase of municipal issues if the yields are attractive given the lower federal tax rate related to the recent changes under the Tax Act. We may also consider municipal issues that are CRA-eligible investments. Our investment portfolio is a significant component of our operations and, as such, it functions as a key element of liquidity and asset/liability management. Two types of classifications are approved for investment securities which are Available-for-Sale ( AFS ) and Held-for-Maturity ( HTM ). In 2017 and 2018, we purchased securities under both the AFS and HTM designations. At December 31, 2018, $446.2 million, or 67.2% of our investment portfolio was classified as AFS, with the remaining $217.3 million, or 32.8%, classified as HTM. At December 31, 2017, the AFS and HTM portfolio comprised 68.9% and 31.1%, respectively.

Classification determinations will also factor in regulatory capital requirements, volatility in earnings or other comprehensive income, and liquidity needs. Securities in the AFS portfolio are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses associated with these securities recorded net of tax, in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of shareowners equity. Securities designated as HTM are those acquired or owned with the intent of holding them to maturity (final payment date). HTM investments are measured at amortized cost. It is neither management current intent nor practice to participate in the trading of investment securities for the purpose of recognizing gains and therefore we do not maintain a trading portfolio. At December 31, 2018, there were 492 positions (combined AFS and HTM) with unrealized losses totaling $6.4 million. GNMA mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasuries, and SBA securities carry the full faith and credit guarantee of the U.S. Government, and are 0% risk-weighted assets. SBA securities float monthly or quarterly with the prime rate and are uncapped. None of these positions with unrealized losses are considered impaired, and all are expected to mature at par. The table below provides a break-down of our unrealized losses by security type.

Balances of SBA and GNMA securities increased compared to the prior year, and were partially offset by declines in U.S. Treasuries and municipal bonds. The average life of our investment portfolio increased slightly as GNMA securities purchased had longer average lives than the existing portfolio. See Table 12 for a break-down of maturities by investment type. 51 The weighted average taxable equivalent yield of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2018 was 2.20% versus 1.68% in 2017. This increase in yield reflected the reinvestment of proceeds from lower yielding securities into higher yielding securities during 2018 as market rates increased. Our bond portfolio contained no investments in obligations, other than U.S. Governments, of any state, municipality, political subdivision or any other issuer that exceeded 10% of our shareowners equity at December 31, 2018.

Deposits and Funds Purchased Average total deposits for 2018 were $2.423 billion, an increase of $51.1 million, or 2.2%, over 2017. Average deposits increased $89.1 million, or 3.9%, from 2016 to 2017. The year-over-year increase compared to 2017 occurred in noninterest bearing and savings accounts, partially offset by the decreases in the remaining product types. Increases in 2017 compared to 2016 were experienced in all deposit types except certificates of deposit. The seasonal inflow of public funds started in the fourth quarter of 2018 and is expected to continue into the first quarter of 2019. Deposit levels remain strong as we continue to see growth in our non-maturity deposits. Our mix of deposits continues to improve as certificates of deposit are replaced with noninterest bearing demand accounts. We continue to closely monitor several metrics such as the sensitivity of our deposit rates, our overall liquidity position, and competitor rates when pricing deposits. This strategy is consistent with previous rate cycles, and allows us to manage the mix of our deposits rather than compete on rate. We believe this enabled us to maintain a low cost of funds of 27 basis points for 2018 and 16 basis points for 2017. 52 Table 2 provides an analysis of our average deposits, by category, and average rates paid thereon for each of the last three years. Table 13 reflects the shift in our deposit mix over the last year and Table 14 provides a maturity distribution of time deposits in denominations of $100,000 and over at December 31, 2018. Average short-term borrowings, which include federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances (maturing in less than one year), and other borrowings, increased $1.1 million, or 10.7% in 2018. The higher balance was primarily attributable to increases in repurchase agreements. See Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on short-term borrowings. We continue to focus on the value of our deposit franchise, which produces a strong base of core deposits with minimal reliance on wholesale funding.

Market risk arises from changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices. We have risk management policies designed to monitor and limit exposure to market risk and we do not participate in activities that give rise to significant market risk involving exchange rates, commodity prices, or equity prices. In asset and liability management activities, our policies are designed to minimize structural interest rate risk. Interest Rate Risk Management. Our net income is largely dependent on net interest income. Net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the degree that interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than interest-earning assets. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets in a given period, a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling market interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income. Net interest income is also affected by changes in the portion of interest-earning assets that are funded by interest-bearing liabilities rather than by other sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and shareowners equity. 53 We have established what we believe to be a comprehensive interest rate risk management policy, which is administered by management Asset Liability Management Committee ( ALCO ). The policy establishes limits of risk, which are quantitative measures of the percentage change in net interest income (a measure of net interest income at risk) and the fair value of equity capital (a measure of economic value of equity ( EVE ) at risk) resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for maturities from one day to 30 years. We measure the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on our short-term earnings, long-term value, and liquidity by employing simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling. The simulation model captures optionality factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors imbedded in investment and loan portfolio contracts. As with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology used by us. When interest rates change, actual movements in different categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, loan prepayments, and withdrawals of time and other deposits, may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the model. Finally, the methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable-rate loan clients ability to service their debts, or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan and deposit products. The balance sheet is subject to testing for interest rate shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk. We prepare a current base case and several alternative interest rate simulations (-200, -100,+100, +200, +300, and +400 basis points (bp)), at least once per quarter, and report the analysis to ALCO, our Market Risk Oversight Committee ( MROC ), our Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee ( EROC ) and the Board of Directors. (The -200bp rate scenario was re-established in the third quarter 2018). We augment our interest rate shock analysis with alternative interest rate scenarios on a quarterly basis that may include ramps, parallel shifts, and a flattening or steepening of the yield curve (non-parallel shift). In addition, more frequent forecasts may be produced when interest rates are particularly uncertain or when other business conditions so dictate. Our goal is to structure the balance sheet so that net interest earnings at risk over 12-month and 24-month periods and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels. We attempt to achieve this goal by balancing, within policy limits, the volume of floating-rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating-rate assets, by keeping the average maturity of fixed-rate asset and liability contracts reasonably matched, by managing the mix of our core deposits, and by adjusting our rates to market conditions on a continuing basis. During the third and fourth quarters of 2018, instantaneous rate shocks of down 200 bp were outside of desired parameters due to limited repricing of deposits relative to the decline in rates. Analysis. Measures of net interest income at risk produced by simulation analysis are indicators of an institution short-term performance in alternative rate environments. These measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period, and do not necessarily indicate the long-term prospects or economic value of the institution. ESTIMATED CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME (1) Percentage Change (12-month shock) +400 bp +300 bp +200 bp +100 bp -100 bp -200 bp Policy Limit -15.0 % -12.5 % -10.0 % -7.5 % -7.5 % -10.0 % December 31, 2018 8.9 % 6.6 % 4.3 % 2.3 % -5.0 % -12.4 % December 31, 2017 13.4 % 9.9 % 6.4 % 3.1 % -8.5 % N/A % Percentage Change (24-month shock) +400 bp +300 bp +200 bp +100 bp -100 bp -200 bp Policy Limit -17.5 % -15.0 % -12.5 % -10.0 % -10.0 % -12.5 % December 31, 2018 37.2 % 29.1 % 21.0 % 13.4 % -6.4 % -20.0 % December 31, 2017 39.9 % 30.4 % 20.9 % 11.8 % -12.0 % N/A % The Net Interest Income ( NII ) at Risk position was less favorable for the period ending December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 for the 12-month shock for all rate scenarios except the down 100 bp scenario, where it improved. The year-over-year unfavorable changes were primarily driven by fixed rate loan growth and elevated rate sensitive deposit balances. Due to these changes, NII benefits to a lesser degree as a per cent change from the base as rates rise. . The model indicates that in the short-term, all rising rate environments will positively impact the net interest margin of the Company, while a declining rate environment of 100bp and -200bp will have a negative impact on the net interest margin. A down 200bp rate scenario was added in the third quarter of 2018. All measures of Net Interest Income at Risk are within our prescribed policy limits over both the 12-month and 24-month periods, with the exception of rates down 200bp. We are out of compliance in the rates down 200 bp scenarios as we have a limited ability to lower our deposit rates the full 200 bp relative to the decline in market rate. In addition, this analysis incorporates an instantaneous, parallel shock and assumes we move with market rates and do not lag our deposit rates. 54 The measures of equity value at risk indicate our ongoing economic value by considering the effects of changes in interest rates on all of our cash flows by discounting the cash flows to estimate the present value of assets and liabilities. The difference between these discounted values of the assets and liabilities is the economic value of equity, which in theory approximates the fair value of our net assets. ESTIMATED CHANGES IN ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY (1) Changes in Interest Rates +400 bp +300 bp +200 bp +100 bp -100 bp -200 bp Policy Limit -30.0 % -25.0 % -20.0 % -15.0 % -15.0 % -20.0 % December 31, 2018 24.6 % 19.7 % 13.9 % 8.0 % -13.8 % -36.8 % December 31, 2017 31.1 % 24.7 % 17.5 % 9.7 % -21.0 % n/a At December 31, 2018, the economic value of equity was less favorable in all rate scenarios except the down 100 bp scenario when compared to December 31, 2017. The year-over-year unfavorable changes were primarily driven by fixed rate loan growth and elevated rate sensitive deposit balances. Due to these changes, EVE benefits to a lesser degree as a percent change from the base as rates rise. A down 200 bp rate scenario was added in the third quarter 2018. This scenario is currently out of compliance as exposure to falling rates is more extreme due to the low interest rates paid on deposits and our limited capacity to reduce those rates relative to the reduction in discount rates used to value them. At this time, we do not plan to take any immediate action to address the out-of-compliance situation in the down 200 bp scenario because we do not believe this scenario is likely to materialize over the short-run. All other rate scenarios are in compliance. As the interest rate environment and the dynamics of the economy continue to change, additional simulations will be analyzed to address not only the changing rate environment, but also the changing balance sheet mix, measured over multiple years, to help assess the risk to the Company. (1) Down 300, and 400 bp rate scenarios have been excluded due to the current interest rate environment. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity In general terms, liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet our cash needs. Our objective in managing our liquidity is to maintain our ability to fund loan commitments, purchase securities, accommodate deposit withdrawals or repay other liabilities in accordance with their terms, without an adverse impact on our current or future earnings. Our liquidity strategy is guided by policies that are formulated and monitored by our ALCO and senior management, and which take into account the marketability of assets, the sources and stability of funding and the level of unfunded commitments. We regularly evaluate all of our various funding sources with an emphasis on accessibility, stability, reliability and cost-effectiveness. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our principal source of funding has been our clients deposits, supplemented by our short-term and long-term borrowings, primarily from our trust-preferred securities, securities sold under repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased and FHLB borrowings. We believe that the cash generated from operations, our borrowing capacity and our access to capital resources are sufficient to meet our future operating capital and funding requirements. At December 31, 2018, we had the ability to generate approximately $1.324 billion in additional liquidity through all of our available resources beyond our overnight funds sold position. In addition to the primary borrowing outlets mentioned above, we also have the ability to generate liquidity by borrowing from the Federal Reserve Discount Window and through brokered deposits. We recognize the importance of maintaining liquidity and has developed a Contingent Liquidity Plan, which addresses various liquidity stress levels and our response and action based on the level of severity. We periodically test our credit facilities for access to the funds, but also understand that as the severity of the liquidity level increases certain credit facilities may no longer be available. We conduct quarterly liquidity stress tests and the results are reported to ALCO, MROC, EROC and the Board of Directors. We believe the liquidity available to us is sufficient to meet our ongoing needs. We also view our investment portfolio as a liquidity source and have the option to pledge securities in our portfolio as collateral for borrowings or deposits, and/or sell selected securities. Our portfolio consists of debt issued by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. governmental agencies, and municipal governments. The weighted-average maturity of our portfolio was 2.11 years at December 31, 2018 and had a net unrealized pre-tax loss of $2.5 million in the AFS portfolio. 55 Our average net overnight funds sold position (defined as funds sold plus interest-bearing deposits with other banks less funds purchased) was $135.4 million during 2018 compared to an average net overnight funds sold position of $190.0 million in 2017. The decrease in this position compared to the prior year reflected higher growth in both the investment and loan portfolios, partially offset by an increase in average deposits. We expect capital expenditures over the next 12 months to be approximately $7.0 million, which will consist primarily of technology purchases for banking offices, business applications, and information technology security needs as well as furniture and fixtures and banking office remodels. We expect that these capital expenditures will be funded with existing resources without impairing our ability to meet our ongoing obligations. Borrowings At December 31, 2018, total advances from the FHLB consisted of $9.9 million in outstanding debt comprised of 11 notes. In 2018, the Bank made FHLB advance payments totaling $1.6 million. Two advances matured, and no new fixed rate advances were obtained in 2018. The FHLB notes are collateralized by a blanket floating lien on all of our 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans, and home equity mortgage loans. We have issued two junior subordinated deferrable interest notes to wholly owned Delaware statutory trusts. The first note for $30.9 million was issued to CCBG Capital Trust I in November 2004. The second note for $32.0 million was issued to CCBG Capital Trust II in May 2005. See Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these borrowings. On April 12, 2016, we retired $10 million in face value of trust preferred securities that were auctioned as part of a liquidation of a pooled collateralized debt obligation fund. The trust preferred securities were originally issued through CCBG Capital Trust I. Our winning bid equated to approximately 75% of the $10 million par value, with the 25% discount resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $2.5 million. We utilized internal resources and a $3.75 million draw on a short-term borrowing facility to fund the repurchase. Table 15 CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS Table 15 sets forth certain information about contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2018. Payments Due By Period (Dollars in Thousands) < 1 Yr > 1 3 Yrs > 3 5 Yrs > 5 Yrs Total Federal Home Loan Bank Advances $ 4,467 $ 2,284 $ 2,852 $ 314 $ 9,917 Note Payable 296 592 592 620 2,100 Subordinated Notes Payable - - - 52,887 52,887 Operating Lease Obligations 468 852 791 1,127 3,238 Time Deposit Maturities 98,960 18,608 3,175 1 120,744 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 104,191 $ 22,336 $ 7,410 $ 54,949 $ 188,886 Capital Shareowners equity was $302.6 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $284.2 million at December 31, 2017. During 2018, shareowners equity was positively impacted by net income of $26.2 million, stock compensation accretion of $1.4 million, net adjustments totaling $1.0 million related to transactions under our stock compensation plans, and $3.5 million decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss for our pension plan. Shareowners equity was reduced by common stock dividends of $5.4 million ($0.32 per share), a net increase of $0.3 million in the unrealized loss on investment securities, and share repurchases (324,441 shares) of $8.0 million. 56 Shareowners' equity as of December 31, for each of the last three years is presented below: (Dollars in Thousands) 2018 2017 2016 Common Stock $ 167 $ 170 $ 168 Additional Paid-in Capital 31,058 36,674 34,188 Retained Earnings 300,177 279,410 267,037 Subtotal 331,402 316,254 301,393 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, Net of Tax (28,815) (32,044) (26,225) Total Shareowners Equity $ 302,587 $ 284,210 $ 275,168 We continue to maintain a strong capital position. The ratio of shareowners' equity to total assets at year-end was 10.23%, 9.80%, and 9.67%, in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We believe our strong capital base offers protection during an economic downturn and provides sufficient capacity to meet our current strategic objectives. We are subject to risk-based capital guidelines that measure capital relative to risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. At December 31, 2018, we had a total risk-based capital ratio of 17.13% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 16.36%, compared to 17.10% and 16.33%, respectively, at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, our common equity tier 1 ratio was 13.58%, compared to 13.42% at December 31, 2017. Our leverage ratio at December 31, 2018, was 10.89% compared to 10.47% at December 31, 2017. For a detailed discussion of our regulatory capital requirements, refer to the Regulatory Considerations Capital Regulations section on page 14. See Note 14 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information as to our capital adequacy. At December 31, 2018, our common stock had a book value of $18.00 per diluted share compared to $16.65 at December 31, 2017. Book value is impacted by the net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities. At December 31, 2018, the net unrealized loss was $2.0 million compared to a $1.7 million net unrealized loss at December 31, 2017. Book value is also impacted by the recording of our unfunded pension liability through other comprehensive income in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 715. At December 31, 2018, the net pension liability reflected in other comprehensive loss was $26.8 million compared to $30.3 million at December 31, 2017. In February 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1,500,000 shares of our outstanding common stock over a five-year period. Repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions; however, we are not obligated to repurchase any specified number of shares. A total of 1,184,730 shares of our outstanding common stock have been repurchased at an average price of $17.37 under the plan. 324,441 shares were repurchased during 2018 at an average price of $24.75. No shares were repurchased in 2017. During 2016, 435,461 shares were repurchased at an average price $14.49 per share. In January, 2019, the 2014 plan was terminated and our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan that authorizes the repurchase of up to 750,000 shares of our outstanding common stock over a five-year period. Terms of this plan are substantially similar to the 2014 plan. Dividends Adequate capital and financial strength is paramount to our stability and the stability of our subsidiary bank. Cash dividends declared and paid should not place unnecessary strain on our capital levels. When determining the level of dividends the following factors are considered: Compliance with state and federal laws and regulations; Our capital position and our ability to meet our financial obligations; Projected earnings and asset levels; and The ability of the Bank and us to fund dividends. Inflation The impact of inflation on the banking industry differs significantly from that of other industries in which a large portion of total resources are invested in fixed assets such as property, plant and equipment. Assets and liabilities of financial institutions are virtually all monetary in nature, and therefore are primarily impacted by interest rates rather than changing prices. While the general level of inflation underlies most interest rates, interest rates react more to changes in the expected rate of inflation and to changes in monetary and fiscal policy. Net interest income and the interest rate spread are good measures of our ability to react to changing interest rates and are discussed in further detail in the section entitled Results of Operations. 57 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not currently engage in the use of derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks. However, we are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our clients. See Note 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2018, we had $468.0 million in commitments to extend credit and $5.0 million in standby letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a client so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. We use the same credit policies in establishing commitments and issuing letters of credit as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. If commitments arising from these financial instruments continue to require funding at historical levels, management does not anticipate that such funding will adversely impact our ability to meet on-going obligations. In the event these commitments require funding in excess of historical levels, management believes current liquidity, investment security maturities, available advances from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank provide a sufficient source of funds to meet these commitments. FOURTH QUARTER, 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS Results of Operations We realized net income of $8.5 million, or $0.50 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $6.0 million, or $0.35 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2018. The growth in earnings reflected a $2.2 million decrease in noninterest expense, a $0.7 million increase in net interest income, and a $0.5 million reduction in the loan loss provision, partially offset by higher income tax expense of $0.8 million and lower noninterest income of $0.1 million. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we sold a banking office and realized a $2.0 million gain, which was reflected in noninterest expense (other real estate). Tax-equivalent net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $24.5 million compared to $23.8 million for the third quarter of 2018. Our net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 3.81% (annualized), an increase of nine basis points over the third quarter of 2018. The increase in both net interest income and the net interest margin were driven by higher interest rates and a favorable shift in the average earning asset mix reflective of loan growth. Our provision for loan losses for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $0.5 million compared to $0.9 million for the third quarter of 2018. The reduction in our provision was primarily attributable to a decrease in impaired loan reserves. Net loan charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $0.5 million compared to net loan charge-offs of $0.2 million for the third quarter of 2018. Noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $13.2 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 0.5%, from the third quarter of 2018 attributable to lower mortgage banking fees of $0.2 million partially offset by higher wealth management fees. Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $26.5 million, a decrease of $2.2 million, or 7.6%, from the third quarter of 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower OREO expense of $2.0 million and other expense of $0.7 million, partially offset by higher compensation expense of $0.4 million. The lower OREO expense reflected a $2.0 million gain from the sale of a banking office in the fourth quarter of 2018. The reduction in other expense was attributable to a decline in other losses, lower professional fees and processing fees. Higher cash incentive expense drove the increase in compensation expense. We realized income tax expense of $2.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to income tax expense of $1.3 million for the third quarter of 2018. Income tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 included a $0.3 million discrete tax benefit related to a property cost segregation analysis that provided benefits from the effects of federal tax reform. Income tax expense for the third quarter of 2018 included a $0.4 million discrete tax benefit related to a pension plan contribution made during the third quarter of 2018 for the plan year 2017. Absent these discrete items, our effective tax rate was approximately 24% for each respective quarter. Discussion of Financial Condition Average earning assets were $2.554 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $19.2 million, or 0.8%, over the third quarter of 2018 attributable to a higher level of deposits. Average loans increased $38.5 million, or 2.2% compared to the third quarter of 2018 and reflected growth in all loan types except home equity loans and construction loans. 58 Nonperforming assets (nonaccrual loans and OREO) totaled $9.1 million at December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $0.5 million, or 5.1%, from September 30, 2018. Nonaccrual loans totaled $6.9 million at December 31, 2018, comparable to September 30, 2018. The balance of OREO totaled $2.2 million at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $0.5 million from September 30, 2018. Nonperforming assets represented 0.31% of total assets at December 31, 2018 compared to 0.34% at September 30, 2018. Average total deposits were $2.412 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $20.1 million, or 0.8%, over the third quarter of 2018 and reflected higher noninterest bearing deposit and savings accounts, partially offset by lower money market accounts and certificates of deposit balances. ACCOUNTING POLICIES Critical Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make various estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We believe that, of our significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Allowance for Loan Losses . The allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which represents management best estimate of probable losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance is the amount considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on management evaluation of credit risk as of the balance sheet date. Our allowance for loan losses includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The level of the allowance reflects management continuing evaluation of specific credit risks, loss experience, loan portfolio quality, economic conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio, as well as trends in the foregoing. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as information becomes available. The Company allowance for loan losses consists of two components: (i) specific reserves established for probable losses on impaired loans; and (ii) general reserves for non-homogenous loans not deemed impaired and homogenous loan pools based on, but not limited to, historical loan loss experience, current economic and market conditions, levels of past due loans, and levels of problem loans. Our financial results are affected by the changes in and the absolute level of the allowance for loan losses. This estimation process is judgmental and requires an estimate of the loss severity rates that we apply to our unimpaired loan portfolio. Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets. We perform an impairment review on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Adverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations, or other factors could result in a decline in the estimated implied fair value of goodwill. If the estimated implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, a loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to the estimated implied fair value. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and in 2017 adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying Accounting for Goodwill Impairment which allows for a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment indicators. If the assessment indicates that impairment has more than likely occurred, the Company must compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the excess. During the fourth quarter, we performed our annual impairment testing. We proceeded with qualitative assessment by evaluating impairment indicators and concluded that a below peer return on average assets warranted movement to a fair value assessment. We estimated the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing a market approach that was supplemented with a reconciliation of the resulting equity value of the Company with our market capitalization. The market approach utilized the guideline company valuation ( GLC ) method to determine the overall equity valuation. A book and tangible book multiple was developed to determine a market value of equity on a controlling basis. The multiples that resulted from the GLC method were validated by comparing to peer companies. A control premium was then applied to the minority value to calculate a fair value indication for the Company. The control premium selected was validated by reviewing recent bank merger and acquisition transactions. Based on the outcome of the fair value assessment, the estimated fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of goodwill and therefore, no impairment existed at December 31, 2018. For the fair value assessment, both economic conditions and observable bank purchase transactions can impact the outcome of the market valuation approach. 59 Pension Assumptions . We have a defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of substantially all of our associates. Our funding policy with respect to the pension plan is to contribute, at a minimum, amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements as set by law. Pension expense is determined by an external actuarial valuation based on assumptions that are evaluated annually as of December 31, the measurement date for the pension obligation. The service cost component of pension expense is reflected as Compensation Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. All other components of pension expense are reflected as Other Expense . The Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition reflect an accrued pension benefit cost due to funding levels and unrecognized actuarial amounts. The most significant assumptions used in calculating the pension obligation are the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligation, the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and the assumed rate of annual compensation increases. These assumptions are re-evaluated annually with the external actuaries, taking into consideration both current market conditions and anticipated long-term market conditions. The discount rate is determined by matching the anticipated defined pension plan cash flows to the spot rates of a corporate Aa-rated bond index/yield curve and solving for the single equivalent discount rate which would produce the same present value. This methodology is applied consistently from year-to-year. The discount rate utilized in 2018 was 3.71%. The estimated impact to 2018 pension expense of a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have been a decrease and increase of approximately $812,000 and $857,000, respectively. We anticipate using a 4.43% discount rate in 2019. Based on the balances as of the December 31, 2018 measurement date, the estimated after tax impact in accumulated other comprehensive income of a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate is a decrease or increase of approximately $4.7 million. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the current and anticipated future mix of assets in the plan. The assets currently consist of equity securities, U.S. Government and Government agency debt securities, and other securities (typically temporary liquid funds awaiting investment). The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilized for 2018 was 7.25%. The estimated impact to 2018 pension expense of a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the rate of return would have been an approximate $330,000 increase or decrease, respectively. We anticipate using a rate of return on plan assets for 2019 of 7.25%. The assumed rate of annual compensation increases of 3.25% in 2018 reflected expected trends in salaries and the employee base. We anticipate using a compensation increase of 4.00% for 2019 reflecting current market trends. Detailed information on the pension plan, the actuarially determined disclosures, and the assumptions used are provided in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes . Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. We recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in other expenses. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and other regulatory bodies have enacted new accounting pronouncements and standards that either have impacted our results in prior years presented, or will likely impact our results in 2018. Please refer to Note 1 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
