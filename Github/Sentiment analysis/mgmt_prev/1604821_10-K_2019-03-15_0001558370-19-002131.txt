ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report. Overview We are a growing diagnostics company with proprietary molecular and bioinformatics technology that we are deploying to change the management of genetic disease worldwide. Our goal is to develop and commercialize non- or minimally-invasive tests to evaluate risk for a wide range of genetic conditions, such as Down syndrome, the results of which can enable early detection, diagnosis and treatment. Our technology has been proven clinically and commercially in the prenatal testing space. We have begun translating this success into the liquid biopsy space, where we are leveraging our core expertise to develop products for oncology diagnostic applications, and are also working to develop a transplant rejection test. We seek to enable even wider adoption of our technology through our global cloud-based distribution model. In addition to our direct sales force in the United States, we have a global network of over 100 laboratory and distribution partners, including many of the largest international laboratories. Since 2009, we have launched a comprehensive suite of ten products in women health and prenatal testing nine molecular diagnostic tests and a newborn stem cell banking offering to complement our prenatal testing portfolio and our personalized liquid biopsy technology for oncology diagnostic applications, for research use only by oncology researchers and biopharmaceutical companies. We generate a majority of our revenues from the sale of Panorama, our non-invasive prenatal test, or NIPT, which we commercially launched in March 2013. We launched our microdeletions panel for Panorama in 2014 and our twins, egg donor, and surrogate screening capabilities in 2017. We also generate a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of our Horizon Carrier Screening (HCS) test, which we launched in 2012. We launched our Constellation software platform, which forms the core of our cloud-based distribution model, in May 2015. Our revenues were $257.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $209.6 million and $212.5 million, as revised, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We were formed in 2003 under our former name, Gene Security Network. From 2006 through 2013, the National Institutes of Health awarded us cumulative grants of $5.7 million to conduct various research projects including non-invasive aneuploidy screening on circulating fetal cells for prenatal diagnosis. An initial period of research and development was followed by the commercialization of Spectrum Preimplantation Genetic Screening (PGS) in 2009 and Spectrum Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) in 2010; Anora Products of Conception (POC) in 2010; our non-invasive prenatal paternity test in 2011; Horizon Carrier Screening in 2012; Panorama NIPT in 2013; our microdeletions panel for Panorama in 2014; Constellation in 2015; and Evercord, Vistara, Signatera (RUO) and our new Panorama test offered to screen twin pregnancies for zygosity and chromosomal abnormalities in 2017. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we processed most of our tests in our laboratory certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, in San Carlos, California. A portion of our HCS and Vistara testing is performed by third-party laboratories. Our customers include independent laboratories, national and regional reference laboratories, medical centers and physician practices for our screening tests; individual patients and families for our Evercord cord blood and tissue service; and research laboratories and pharmaceutical companies for our Signatera (RUO) liquid biopsy technology. We market and sell our prenatal screening tests both through our direct sales force and through our laboratory distribution partners. We bill clinics, laboratory distribution partners, patients and insurance payers for the tests we perform. In cases where we bill laboratory distribution partners, our partners in turn bill clinics, patients and insurers. The majority of our revenue comes from insurers. Insurers with which we have in-network contracts reimburse for NIPT procedures based on positive coverage determinations, which means that the insurer has determined that NIPT in general is medically necessary for this category of patient. In the United States, the majority of insurance providers provide positive NIPT coverage. As of December 31, 2018, we have in-network contracts with insurance providers that account for approximately 209 million covered lives in the United States. A "covered life" means a 78 Table of Contents subscriber, or a dependent of a subscriber, who is insured under an insurance policy with the insurance carrier identified. The number of covered lives represented by insurers that have positive coverage determinations or with which we or our laboratory distribution partners have a contract provides a measure of our access to the healthcare market. Although our target market for NIPT is a much smaller subset of the total number of covered lives because it excludes subscribers for whom our NIPT would not be performed, such as men, children and post-menopausal women, we believe the number of U.S. covered lives for whom we have access under contract represents an important indicator of our access to the total available market for our products. Insurers also reimburse for our products through out-of-network claims submission processes where we do not have a contract with that insurer. The principal focus of our commercial operations currently is to distribute molecular diagnostic tests through our direct sales force, our laboratory distribution partners, and our Constellation licensees under our cloud-based distribution model. The number of tests that we accession is a key indicator that we use to assess our business. A test is accessioned when we receive the test at our laboratory, the relevant information about the test is entered into our computer system and the test sample is routed into the appropriate sample flow. This number is a subset of the number of tests that we process, which includes tests distributed through our Constellation licensees. The number of tests that we process is a key metric as it tracks overall volume growth, particularly as our laboratory partners may transition from sending samples to our laboratory to our cloud-based distribution model. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we processed approximately 668,600 tests, comprised of approximately 625,900 tests accessioned in our laboratory and 39,100 processed through our Constellation software platform, or Constellation units, compared to approximately 515,200 tests processed during the year ended December 31, 2017, comprised of approximately 486,000 tests accessioned and 29,200 Constellation units; and approximately 447,600 tests processed during the year ended December 31, 2016, comprised of approximately 430,600 tests accessioned and 17,000 Constellation units. This increase in volume represents continuous commercial growth of Panorama, both as tests performed in our laboratory as well as through our Constellation software platform, and HCS. We accessioned approximately 429,600 Panorama tests during the year ended December 31, 2018, which represents an increase of approximately 25% over 2017 and an increase of approximately 29% over 2016. We accessioned approximately 173,800 HCS tests during the year ended December 31, 2018, which represents an increase of approximately 39% over 2017 and an increase of approximately 115% over 2016. Prior to 2016, we experienced rapid growth in our U.S.-based internal sales force as part of our effort to increase the number of tests distributed through our direct sales force, because we generate a higher gross margin when we sell testing services directly. The percent of our revenues attributable to our U.S. direct sales force for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 83%, down from 84% when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, but up from 78% when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The percent of our revenues attributable to U.S. laboratory partners for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 5%, which was flat when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 and down from 11% when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Our ability to increase our revenues and gross profit will depend on our ability to further penetrate the U.S. market with our direct sales force. The percent of our revenues attributable to international laboratory partners and other international sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 was 12%, up from 11% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 11% for the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition to distributing molecular diagnostic tests to be performed at our laboratory, either directly or through our laboratory partners, we also establish licensing arrangements with laboratories under our cloud-based distribution model, whereby our laboratory licensees run the molecular workflows themselves and then access bioinformatics algorithms through our cloud-based Constellation software. This cloud-based distribution model results in lower revenues and gross profit per test than in cases where we process a test ourselves; however, because we don t incur the costs of processing the tests ourselves, our costs per test under this model are also lower. In February 2014, we entered into a licensing and service arrangement with DNA Diagnostics Center, Inc., or DDC, to enable the development of a non-invasive prenatal paternity test based on our proprietary technology. DDC commercializes this test, and we receive royalty revenues from DDC. Starting the fourth quarter of 2015, we began entering into other licensing arrangements. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we have recognized revenues of $2.4 million, $2.4 million and $2.2 million from the DDC arrangement, respectively. Regarding revenues recognized from our licensing arrangements, we have recognized $2.4 million, $1.8 million and $0.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 79 Table of Contents In April 2017, we launched Evercord, a private cord blood and cord tissue processing and storage service. Our U.S. direct sales force sells Evercord to the same OB/GYNs who prescribe and order Panorama and HCS tests, and our own inside sales force offers this product to our existing and past patients who have used our Panorama and HCS tests. Upon the launch of Evercord, we also entered into an agreement with a cord blood bank to perform processing and testing of cord blood and cord tissue units and to store those units at its facility. Our Evercord service includes the provision of a collection kit and the collection, processing and storage of newborn cord blood and cord tissue units. Evercord customers pay a one-time fee for the processing of the units. Customers have the option to store their units under an annual plan, or to pre-pay for 18 years or the duration of their lifetime (for which we assume a useful life of 78 years); they also have the option to pay for storage in full at the time of collection of the unit, or over a period of six, 12, or 18 months. In May 2017, we launched Vistara, which is an NIPT that screens for single-gene disorders and offered as complement to Panorama. Upon the launch of Vistara, we entered into an agreement with a laboratory partner to collaborate in improving test performance and to launch commercially. In August 2017, we launched Signatera (RUO), which is a circulating tumor DNA technology that analyzes and tracks mutations specific to an individual tumor, for research use only by oncology researchers and biopharmaceutical companies. In October 2017, we expanded our Panorama test to now screen twin pregnancies for zygosity and chromosomal abnormalities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, total revenues were $257.7 million, compared to $209.6 million and $212.5 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, as revised. Panorama revenues accounted for $140.9 million, or 55%, of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018; $128.9 million, or 62%, of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, as revised; and $140.6 million, or 66%, of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, as revised. HCS revenues accounted for $87.2 million, or 34% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018; $63.5 million, or 30%, of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, as revised; $56.4 million, or 27% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, as revised. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, there were no customers exceeding 10% of the total revenues on an individual basis. In January 2017, we terminated our licensing and distribution agreement with Bio-Reference, which represented less than 1% and 7% of total revenues, as revised, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Revenues from customers outside the United States were $31.7 million, representing 12% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, revenues from customers outside the United States were $24.1 million and $24.0 million, representing approximately 11% and 11%, respectively, of total revenues, as revised. Most of our revenues have been denominated in U.S. dollars, but we began to generate revenue in foreign currency in 2015, primarily denominated in Euros. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were, respectively, $128.2 million, $137.6 million and $100.3 million, as revised. This included non-cash stock compensation expense of $14.2 million, $11.4 million and $10.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $574.6 million. Components of the Results of Operations Revenues We generate revenues from the sale of our genetic tests, primarily from the sale of our Panorama and HCS tests. Our two primary distribution channels are our direct sales force and our laboratory partners. In cases where we promote our tests through our direct sales force, we generally bill directly to a patient, clinic or insurance carrier, or a combination of the insurance carrier and patient for the fees. In cases where we sell our tests through our laboratory partners, the majority of our laboratory partners bill the patient, clinic or insurance carrier for the performance of our tests, and we are entitled to either a fixed price per test or a percentage of their collections. 80 Table of Contents Starting the fourth quarter of 2015, we began recognizing licensing revenues through the licensing and the provisioning of services to support the use of our proprietary technology by our cloud-based distribution model licensees. Starting the second quarter of 2017, we began recognizing revenues from Evercord offering. Sales of Panorama and HCS tests are recorded as product revenues. Revenues recognized from tests processed through our Constellation software platform, Evercord and Signatera revenues, and revenue recognized from the Qiagen Agreement are reported in licensing and other revenues. As of December 31, 2018, we have commercially launched 15 licensing and service arrangements with laboratories under our cloud-based distribution model from which we recognized revenue from in 2018. Prior to 2018, we recognized the majority of our revenues from contracts with insurance carriers upon receipt of cash due to limited historical experience and uncertainty in determining the amount of revenue and timing of collections. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue guidance, Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606 ), using the full retrospective approach. In accordance with ASC 606, the total consideration we expect to collect from insurance carriers, clinics, and patients in exchange for the goods and services provided is accrued in the period in which our tests are reported to customers. Due to potential future changes in insurance coverage policies, contractual rates, and other trends in the reimbursement of our tests, our collections may fluctuate significantly over time. Our ability to increase our revenues will depend on our ability to further penetrate the domestic and international markets and, in particular generate sales through our direct sales force, develop and commercialize additional tests, obtain reimbursement from additional third-party payers and increase our reimbursement rate for tests performed. In particular, our financial performance depends on reimbursement for Panorama in the average risk population and for microdeletions. The use of Panorama in the average risk population is not yet broadly reimbursed, although some third-party payers have begun to reimburse for this. Many third-party payers do not currently reimburse for microdeletions screening, as further discussed in the risk factor entitled Reimbursement and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business If we are unable to expand or maintain third-party payer coverage and reimbursement for Panorama and our other tests, or if we are required to refund any reimbursements already received, our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected, in part because there is currently limited published data on the performance of microdeletions screening tests. A new current procedure terminology, or CPT, code for microdeletions went into effect on January 1, 2017. We have experienced low average reimbursement rates thus far for microdeletions testing under this new code, and we expect that this new code will cause, at least in the near term, our microdeletions reimbursement to remain low, due to third-party payers declining to reimburse and through reduced reimbursement under the new code. This has had, and we expect it will continue to have, an adverse impact on our revenues. In addition, a new CPT code for expanded carrier screening took effect beginning January 1, 2019, and may have an adverse effect on our reimbursement rates for our broader Horizon carrier screening panel, for which we previously primarily received reimbursement on a per-condition basis, as those tests may be reimbursed as a combined single panel instead of as multiple individual tests. Our financial performance is also impacted by our increase in in-network coverage with third-party payers, which we believe is crucial to our growth and long-term success. However, because the negotiated fees under our contracts with third-party payers are typically lower than the list price of our tests, as we enter into additional in-network contracts with insurance providers, our average reimbursement per test decreases. While we expect the reduction in average reimbursement per test from in-network pricing to reduce our revenues and gross margins in the near term, in-network pricing is more predictable than out-of-network pricing, and we intend to continue to mitigate the impact by driving more business from our most profitable accounts. In addition, our strategy to offer our tests to laboratory licensees via our Constellation cloud-based software platform may also cause our revenues to decrease because we do not process the tests and perform the molecular biology analysis in our own laboratory under this model, and therefore are not able to charge as high an amount, and as a result realize lower revenues per test than when we perform the entire test ourselves. However, cost of licensing and other revenues for the Constellation software platform are relatively low, and therefore, we expect its associated gross margin to be higher. 81 Table of Contents Cost of Product Revenues The components of our cost of product revenues are materials and service costs, impairment charges associated with testing equipment, personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with testing samples, electronic medical record, order and delivery systems, shipping charges to transport samples, costs incurred from outsourcing our tests to third parties, and allocated overhead such as rent, information technology costs, equipment depreciation and utilities. Costs associated with performing tests are recorded when the test is accessioned. We expect cost of product revenues in absolute dollars to increase as the number of tests we perform increases. However, having rapidly achieved scale, we have increased our focus on more efficient use of labor, automation, and DNA sequencing. For example, we updated the molecular and bioinformatics process for Panorama to further reduce the sequencing reagents, test steps and associated labor costs required to obtain a test result, while increasing the accuracy of the test to allow it to run with lower fetal fraction input. These improvements also reduced the frequency of the need to require blood redraws from the patient. Cost of Licensing and Other Revenues The components of our cost of licensing and other revenues are material costs associated with test kits, engineering costs incurred by our research and development team to improve and maintain our Constellation software platform, and amortization of Constellation software development costs. Cost of licensing and other revenues also include costs associated with Evercord. Such costs are related to collection kits consumed during the processing of cord blood samples, fees paid to our partner for the processing service and storage of the cord blood samples, and freight charged to transport the samples to the storage facility. We currently have 15 revenue generating licensing and service agreements with laboratories and continue to have active discussions with many other potential licensees under our Constellation distribution model. We consider our cost of licensing and other revenues for the Constellation software platform to be relatively low, and therefore we expect its associated gross margin to be higher. While costs associated with our licensing arrangements have become steady over time, we expect additional costs associated with Evercord to cause cost of licensing and other revenues to increase. Research and Development Research and development expenses include costs incurred to develop our technology, collect clinical samples and conduct clinical studies to develop and support our products. These costs consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense: prototype materials; laboratory supplies; consulting costs; regulatory costs; electronic medical record set up costs; and costs associated with setting up and conducting clinical studies at domestic and international sites and allocated overhead, including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing enhanced and new products. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses include executive, selling and marketing, legal, finance and accounting, human resources, billing and client services. These expenses consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense; direct marketing expenses; audit and legal expenses; consulting costs; training and medical education activities; payer outreach programs and allocated overhead, including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation, and utilities. In the near term, we expect general and administrative expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Nasdaq Global Select Market, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services to become steady, whereas selling and marketing related expenses remain relatively flat. 82 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense is attributable to borrowing under our Credit Line and 2017 Term Loan, as well as the amortization of debt discount associated with the 2017 Term Loan. Interest Income and Other (Expense) Income, Net Interest income and other (expense) income, net is comprised of interest earned on our cash, realized gains and losses on investments, foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses, changes in the fair value of our warrants, and finance charges related to the unused borrowing capacity of our 2017 Term Loan. Critical Accounting Policies Our management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of these accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the following critical accounting policies to reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements. Revenue Recognition Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, using the full retrospective approach, which required us to record a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the earliest period presented in the consolidated financial statements. We recognize revenues when, or as, performance obligations in the contracts are satisfied, in the amount reflecting the expected consideration to be received from the goods or services transferred to the customers. Product Revenues Product revenues are derived from contracts with insurance carriers, laboratory partners and patients in connection with sales of prenatal genetic tests. The majority of our revenues is derived from Panorama NIPT, HCS, and to a lesser extent, other genetic tests. We enter into contracts with insurance carriers with primarily payment terms related to tests provided to the patients who have health insurance coverage. Insurance carriers are considered third-party payers on behalf of the patients, and the patients are considered the customers who receive genetic test services. Tests may be billed to insurance carriers, patients, or a combination of insurance carriers and patients. Further, we sell tests to a number of domestic and international laboratory partners and identify the laboratory partners as customers provided that there is a test services agreement between us and them. A performance obligation represents a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer, which represents a unit of accounting in accordance with ASC 606. A portion of the consideration should be allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. We evaluate our contracts with insurance carriers, laboratory partners and patients and identify a single performance obligation in those contracts, which is the delivery of the test results. 83 Table of Contents The total consideration which we expect to collect in exchange for our products is an estimate and may be fixed or variable. Consideration includes reimbursement from both patients and insurance carriers, adjusted for variable consideration related to disallowed cases, discounts, refunds and doubtful accounts, and is estimated using the expected value approach. For insurance carriers with similar reimbursement characteristics, we use a portfolio of relevant historical data to estimate variable consideration and total collections for our products. We constrain the estimated variable consideration when we assess it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized may occur in future periods. The consideration expected from laboratory partners usually includes a fixed amount, but it can be variable depending on the volume of tests performed, and we determine the variable consideration using the expected value approach. For insurance carriers, laboratory partners and patients, we allocate the total consideration to a single performance obligation, which is the delivery of the test results to the customers. When assessing the total consideration for insurance carriers and patients, a certain percentage of revenues is further constrained for estimated refunds. We generally bill an insurance carrier, a laboratory partner or a patient upon delivery of test results. We also bill patients directly for out-of-pocket costs involving co-pays and deductibles that they are responsible for. Tests billed to insurance carriers and directly to patients usually take an average of nine to twelve months to collect the payments, and for tests billed to laboratory distribution partners, the average collection cycle takes approximately two to three months. At times, the Company may or may not get reimbursed for the full amount billed. Further, we may not get reimbursed at all for tests performed if such tests are not covered under the insurance carrier reimbursement policies or we are not a qualified provider to the insurance carrier, or if the tests were not previously authorized. Product revenue is recognized in an amount that equals the total consideration (as described above) at a point in time when the test results are delivered. We reserve certain amounts in other accrued liabilities on the balance sheet in anticipation of requests for refunds of payments previously made by insurance carriers, which are accounted for as reductions in product revenues in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, $3.3 million and $4.9 million were released from amounts previously held in reserves in other accrued liabilities and recognized as product revenue. There were no amounts released from our reserves during the year ended December 31, 2016. Licensing and Other Revenues We recognize licensing revenues from our Constellation cloud-based distribution model, pursuant to which we grant licenses to laboratories to access our proprietary bioinformatics algorithms through our cloud-based software to analyze the results of molecular workflows that such licensees perform in their laboratories. We also recognize revenues from our Evercord offering for the processing and storage of newborn cord blood and cord tissue units, Signatera (RUO), and our License, Development and Distribution Agreement with Qiagen ( the Qiagen Agreement ). Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740 ), which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of our future financial and operating activities. Under ASC 740, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the temporary difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect such differences to reverse. If we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize the value of some or all of our deferred tax assets (net of our deferred tax liabilities), we establish a valuation allowance offsetting the amount we do not expect to realize. We perform this analysis each reporting period and reduce our measurement of deferred taxes, if the likelihood we will realize them becomes uncertain. We also account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, which requires us to adjust our financial statements to reflect only those tax positions that are more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon review by federal or state examiners. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on 84 Table of Contents examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Our policy is to report interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expenses. On December 22, 2017, President Donald Trump signed into U.S. law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ( Tax Act ). The Tax Act reduced the corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. ASC 740 required entities to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment. Shortly after the enactment of the Tax Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118 ) to address the application of the U.S. GAAP in situations when an entity does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. We made provisional adjustments to reduce our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017, based on the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate and assessed the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on our current understanding of the provisions of the new law. As of December 31, 2018, we completed our assessment of the tax rate change and determined no additional adjustments were required. Stock-Based Compensation We have included stock-based compensation as part of our cost of revenues and our operating expenses in our statements of operations as follows: Year ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Employee Non-Employee Total Employee Non-Employee Total Employee Non-Employee Total (in thousands) Cost of revenues $ 564 $ 5 $ 569 $ 544 $ $ 544 $ 651 $ (10) $ 641 Research and development 4,043 4,043 3,214 3,214 2,829 24 2,853 Selling, general and administrative 9,474 112 9,586 7,644 7,644 6,837 270 7,107 Total $ 14,081 $ 117 $ 14,198 $ 11,402 $ $ 11,402 $ 10,317 $ 284 $ 10,601 Stock-based compensation related to stock options granted to our employees and non-employees is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award, which is determined by the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. No compensation cost is recognized on stock options for employees and non-employees who do not render the requisite service and therefore forfeit their rights to the stock options. The measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustments as the underlying equity instruments vest, and the resulting change in value, if any, is recognized in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the period that the related services are rendered. Impairment of Long-lived Assets We evaluate our long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We then compare the carrying amounts of the assets with the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over the asset fair value determined using discounted estimates of future cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2018, an asset impairment charge of $1.5 million was recorded in research and development expenses in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. This charge was recorded to write off certain project development costs that were previously capitalized. 85 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded asset impairment charges totaling $0.6 million in cost of product revenues. The charges were recorded after we fully decommissioned certain sequencing and automation equipment in January 2017 . For the year ended December 31, 2016, we performed an impairment analysis on a number of sequencing and automation equipment, and their service lives were accelerated as we determined that they were significantly shorter than we had initially expected. As a result, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $2.1 million.

Total revenues increased by $48.0 million, or 22.9%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Total revenues declined by $2.9 million, or 1.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. We transitioned to the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, as of January 1, 2018 on a full retrospective basis, and total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were impacted by this transition. Product revenues During the year ended December 31, 2018, product revenues increased $36.6 million, or 18.0%, as a result of continued revenue growth in Panorama and HCS tests. Panorama and HCS revenues had a net increase of $12.0 million and $23.7 million, respectively. A portion of the net increase in Panorama and HCS revenues pertained to cumulative catch-up revenue adjustments totaling approximately $7.0 million and $3.1 million recognized in the current period, respectively, due to collections from appeals on claims in the prior periods. Revenues from other tests increased by $0.8 million. The number of Panorama and HCS tests accessioned continued to grow during the year ended December 31, 2018 86 Table of Contents when compared to the same period in the prior year, and the resulting growth in revenues was partially offset by an erosion in collection trends driven by factors such as prior authorization requirements by insurance carriers, and negative coverage determinations for our microdeletions screening. During the year ended December 31, 2017, product revenues decreased $5.6 million, or 2.7%. The decrease was the combined effect of reductions in Panorama and other test revenues, along with higher HCS revenues. From a volume perspective, the number of Panorama tests accessioned grew when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, however, factors such as erosion in collection trends related to prior authorization requirements, reduced reimbursement for our microdeletions screening, and, to a smaller extent, our termination of a distribution agreement in January 2017 caused Panorama revenues to decrease by $11.7 million. Such decrease was impacted by a favorable movement of $4.1 million of revenues recognized from the release of certain amounts previously held in reserves from third-party payers. Our HCS test volumes increased in the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting in a corresponding increase in revenues from that test by $7.1 million. The increase in HCS revenues included $0.8 million of revenues recognized from the release of certain amounts previously held in reserves from third-party payers. As for other product revenues, the decrease was primarily attributable to erosion in collection trends. Licensing and other revenues Licensing and other revenues increased $11.4 million, or 195.6%, during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in the prior year due to additional revenues of $4.0 million from our Evercord business, $1.1 million from Constellation software licensing arrangements with our licensees and the associated IVD kits. We also recognized revenues totaling $5.8 million from the agreement with Qiagen that we entered into in March 2018. Licensing and other revenues increased by $2.7 million, or 88.3%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to the additional revenues of $1.7 million from our Constellation software licensing arrangements with our licensees and the associated IVD kits, and $1.0 million of revenues recognized from our Evercord business. We derive our revenues from tests based on units reported to customers. All reported units are either accessioned in our laboratory or processed through our Constellation software platform. During the year ended December 31, 2018, total reported units were approximately 628,600, comprising of approximately 591,200 reported units that were accessioned and 37,400 Constellation units. Within this period, we recognized revenues on approximately 412,200 Panorama tests accessioned and 31,300 Panorama Constellation units, and approximately 164,000 HCS tests accessioned. During year ended December 31, 2017, total reported units were approximately 488,500, comprising of approximately 460,400 reported units that were accessioned and 28,100 Constellation units. Within that period, we recognized revenues on approximately 328,800 Panorama tests accessioned and 21,500 Panorama Constellation units, and approximately 117,800 HCS tests accessioned. Revenues from customers outside the United States were $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $24.1 million and $24.0 million, as revised, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cost of product revenues During the year ended December 31, 2018, cost of product revenues increased $22.6 million, or 16.7%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to $10.0 million of additional costs incurred from increased volume of HCS tests accessioned and materials acquired for our in-house HCS automation, higher material and service costs of $9.0 million associated with increased volume of our Panorama test, with the remainder of the increase attributable to labor and overhead allocation driven by resources dedicated to our HCS automation process and depreciation of automation and sequencing equipment utilized for our Panorama test. Cost of product revenues increased by $1.0 million, or 0.8%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to $15.7 million of additional costs incurred in connection with the increased volume of HCS tests accessioned and higher freight charges of $1.3 million associated with overall volume increase in the year ended December 31, 2017, offset by cost savings of $9.6 million resulting from our transition to Version 3 of 87 Table of Contents Panorama, lower overhead of $3.1 million, and lower material costs of $0.3 million related to other products. Further, we benefitted from a decrease of $1.6 million due to lower inventory reserves recorded in the current period, and a decrease of $1.4 million in asset impairment charges after we fully decommissioned our previous generation of sequencing and automation equipment in January 2017. As a percentage of product revenues, cost of product revenues was 66.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 62.9% in the prior year, which was the result of the additional costs incurred due to the higher volume of HCS tests accessioned. Cost of licensing and other revenues Cost of licensing and other revenues increased by $3.9 million, or 95.1%, during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to the launch of our Evercord business in April 2017, and costs incurred in connection with Signatera (RUO) which we launched in August 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, costs incurred from our Evercord business increased $3.7 million, and costs associated with Signatera (RUO) were $1.0 million, while costs associated with the improvement and maintenance of our Constellation software platform decreased by $0.8 million when compared to the same period in the prior year. We expect the reduction in costs required to improve and maintain our Constellation software platform to continue as its design and functionality matures over time. Cost of licensing and other revenues increased by $3.0 million, or 278.5%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year as the number of licensees under our Constellation cloud-based distribution model increased, and as we continued to improve and maintain our Constellation software platform. Costs allocated to Constellation software platform increased approximately $1.3 million, of which $0.8 million was related to engineering and maintenance of our software platform, and $0.5 million was related to the amortization of the Constellation software development and other related material costs. Costs of licensing and other revenues also included $1.7 million in costs associated with Evercord, which we launched in April 2017. Such costs were related to materials consumed in connection with the collection and processing of cord blood samples, fees paid to our partner and medical doctors for sample processing and storage services, and freight charged to transport the samples to the storage facility. Research and development Research and development expenses increased $1.3 million, or 2.6%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily the result of higher salaries and employee benefits of $0.7 million caused by stock-based compensation expense for additional awards granted and bonuses accrued, higher consulting fees of $0.3 million, higher facilities-related and office expenses of $0.7 million, an impairment charge of $1.5 million recognized for writing off the project development costs previously capitalized; offset by a $1.7 million decrease in depreciation and overhead allocated to research and development and a $0.4 million decrease in laboratory supplies as upon completion of the development of our HCS automation workflow, which expenses then shifted to cost of product revenues as we implemented the new workflow, while we expanded our research and development activities in support of transplant and oncology product offerings. Research and development expenses increased by $8.2 million, or 19.6%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher salaries and benefit costs of $2.7 million as a result of our annual merit adjustments, higher costs of employee benefits and average headcount growth, facilities-related costs and office expenses of $1.9 million associated with higher repairs and maintenance expenses, and the expansion of our lease premises, along with higher allocation of rent and property management fees for our headquarters in San Carlos, California. Expenses associated with clinical trials and research and related laboratory supplies increased by $3.3 million related to our existing and newly launched products, including the launch of our Signatera (RUO) liquid biopsy offering in August 2017. Depreciation and overhead increased by $1.1 million as a result of testing and validation work performed on our HCS automation equipment. These were offset by a decrease in outside services of $0.8 million following the completion of certain research projects. 88 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.4 million, or 0.3%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The primary factors causing the decrease were an $11.4 million decrease in legal settlement expenses accrued compared to the same period of the prior year, and a $3.1 million reduction in selling and marketing and travel related expenses. These decreases were offset by higher salaries and employee benefits of $7.6 million associated with stock-based compensation expense for additional awards granted and bonuses accrued, higher fees of $4.2 million paid to third party vendors for collections from insurance carriers and consulting fees for work performed by outside legal counsel, higher facilities-related and office expenses of $1.0 million due to the expansion of occupancy in our San Carlos, California headquarters, higher administration fees $0.5 million charged for our self-funded health insurance plans, and an increase in other corporate-related expenses of $0.7 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $19.2 million, or 14.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $11.4 million in legal settlement expenses accrued for reimbursement related claims, as further discussed in Note 7 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, higher salaries and employee benefit costs of $8.5 million associated with headcount growth, annual merit salary adjustments, higher health insurance premiums charged, and higher stock-based compensation expense. Outside services increased by $0.5 million primarily due to fees paid to consultants hired for technical accounting projects and internal controls assessment, and audit and related fees incurred by our annual audit, quarterly reviews and corporate tax related work. Additionally, facilities, office and other corporate related expenses increased $1.5 million primarily attributable to higher spending on supplies and software subscription, higher depreciation resulting from leasehold improvements made in our Austin, Texas location, and higher rent and property management fees charged for our headquarters in San Carlos, California. These were offset by a $2.7 million decrease in selling and marketing related expenses as we scaled back on speaker conferences, public relations and promotional events. Interest expense Interest expense increased by $6.3 million, or 148.7%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. The increase was the combined result of $5.4 million of additional interest incurred and debt discount amortized in connection with our 2017 Term Loan; $0.6 million of interest charged at the variable interest rate on the Credit Line, which was higher in the year ended December 31, 2018, and $0.3 million of interest incurred from the quarterly installments we paid under the settlement agreement for reimbursement related claims. Interest expense increased by $3.7 million, or 690.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. The increase was the combined result of $3.2 million of interest incurred and debt discount amortized in connection with our 2017 Term Loan and $0.5 million of interest charged at the variable interest rate on our Credit Line, which was higher in the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest and other (expense) income, net Interest and other expense, net was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to interest and other income of $2.4 million in the same period of the prior year, which represented a net increase in expenses of $5.1 million. This net increase in expenses was primarily due to a $5.3 million unfavorable movement on the fair value remeasurement of our warrant liability and a $0.4 million unfavorable change in exchange rates for our foreign currency transactions, offset by higher interest income of $0.6 million related to purchases of new securities for our investment portfolio during the third and fourth quarters of 2018. Interest and other income, net was $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to interest and other income of $1.4 in the prior year, which represented an increase of $1.0 million. The increase was primarily due to a $1.3 million increase in the fair value of our warrant liability, and a decrease in interest income and other expenses of approximately $0.3 million primarily attributable to a reduction of our investment portfolio. 89 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We have incurred net losses each year since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had net losses of $128.2 million; $137.6 million and $100.3 million, as revised, respectively, and we expect to incur additional losses in the future as we continue to devote a substantial portion of our resources to our research and development and commercialization efforts of our existing and new products. As of December 31, 2018, we had $46.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $107.5 million in marketable securities, $50.2 million of outstanding balance of the Credit Line including accrued interest, and $73.4 million of net carrying amount of the 2017 Term Loan. While we have introduced multiple products that are generating revenues, these revenues have not been sufficient to fund all operations. Accordingly, we have funded the portion of operating costs that exceeds revenues through a combination of equity issuances and debt and other financings. We expect to develop and commercialize future products and, consequently, we will need to generate additional revenues to achieve future profitability and may need to raise additional equity or incur additional debt. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders would experience dilution. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders and requires significant debt service payments, which diverts resources from other activities. Additional financing may not be available at all, or in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to delay the development and commercialization of our products and significantly scale back our business and operations. On July 12, 2018, we completed an equity offering to sell 4,500,000 shares of our common stock to the public at a price of $20 per share, along with the sale of 675,000 additional shares of our common stock to the underwriters upon their exercise of the option to purchase those shares. Upon the closing of the equity offering on July 16, 2018, we received proceeds of $97.3 million before offering expenses, which totaled approximately $0.5 million. Based on our current business plan, we believe that our existing cash and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least 12 months after March 15, 2019. Credit Line Agreement In September 2015, we entered into the Credit Line with UBS providing for a $50.0 million revolving line of credit which can be drawn in increments at any time. The Credit Line bears interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 1.10%, and it is secured by a first priority lien and security interest in our money market and marketable securities held in our managed investment account with UBS. UBS has the right to demand full or partial payment of the Credit Line obligations and terminate it, in its discretion and without cause, at any time. 2017 Term Loan In August 2017, we entered into the 2017 Term Loan with OrbiMed, which has a maximum borrowing capacity of $100.0 million. On the closing date of August 8, 2017, we borrowed $75.0 million, with the remaining $25.0 million available to borrow at our option at any time through December 31, 2018, subject to standard conditions. The amounts borrowed under the 2017 Term Loan will primarily be used for general corporate purposes and to fund and support our business and operations. Interest accrues on the outstanding balance of the loan at a rate equal to the sum of (i) 8.75% plus (ii) the higher of 1.00% or LIBOR. The 2017 Term Loan has an 84 month term and will mature in August 2024. We are required to make interest payments on a quarterly basis, with repayment of the full outstanding balance on the maturity date. Our obligations under the 2017 Term Loan are secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property, subject to certain customary exceptions. On December 31, 2018, we amended certain terms in the 2017 Term Loan with OrbiMed. The amendment increased the existing unused borrowing capacity from $25.0 million to $50.0 million and extended the expiration date for the option to draw the additional to March 31, 2019. If such option were exercised by us, the interest rate described above would instead decrease to the sum of (i) 8.50% plus (ii) the higher of 1.00% or LIBOR. 90 Table of Contents Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (As Revised) (As Revised) (in thousands) Cash used in operating activities $ (70,581) $ (97,825) $ (74,052) Cash (used in) provided by investing activities (5,161) 13,784 47,027 Cash provided by financing activities 113,725 80,372 13,184 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 37,983 (3,669) (13,841) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period 13,021 16,690 30,531 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of year $ 51,004 $ 13,021 $ 16,690 Cash Used in Operating Activities Cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $70.6 million.

Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
