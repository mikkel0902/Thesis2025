Overview Five Below is a rapidly growing specialty value retailer offering a broad range of trend-right, high-quality merchandise targeted at the teen and pre-teen customer. We offer a dynamic, edited assortment of exciting products, all priced at $5 and below, including select brands and licensed merchandise across our category worlds. As of February 3, 2018 , we operated 625 stores in 32 states. In August 2016, we commenced selling merchandise on the internet, through our fivebelow.com e-commerce website. We launched our e-commerce operation as an additional channel to service our customers. All e-commerce sales, which includes shipping and handling revenue, are included in net sales and beginning with the third fiscal quarter of 2016, are included in comparable sales. Our e-commerce expenses will have components classified as both cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses. We believe that our business model has resulted in strong financial performance irrespective of the economic environment. Our comparable sales increased by 6.5% in fiscal 2017 , 2.0% in fiscal 2016 and 3.4% in fiscal 2015 . Between fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2017 , our net sales increased from $832.0 million to $1,278.2 million , representing a compounded annual growth rate of 24.0% . Over the same period, our operating income increased from $92.9 million to $157.4 million , representing a compounded annual growth rate of 30.1% . In addition, we expanded our store base from 437 stores at the end of fiscal 2015 to 625 stores at the end of fiscal 2017 . We plan to open approximately 125 new stores in fiscal 2018 . We expect to continue our strong growth in the future. By offering trend-right merchandise at a differentiated price point of $5 and below, our stores have been successful in varying geographic regions, population densities and real estate settings. We operate stores in 32 states in the Northeast, South, Midwest and West regions of the United States. We are primarily located in power, community and lifestyle shopping centers across a variety of urban, suburban and semi-rural markets with trade areas including at least 100,000 people in the specified market. We believe we have the opportunity to expand our store base in the United States from 625 locations as of February 3, 2018 to more than 2,500 locations over time . Our ability to open profitable new stores depends on many factors, including our ability to identify suitable markets and sites; negotiate leases with acceptable terms; achieve brand awareness in the new markets; efficiently source and distribute additional merchandise; and achieve sufficient levels of cash flow and financing to support our expansion. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") was enacted. The TCJA includes a numbers of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact us, most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. We will continue to analyze additional information and guidance related to the TCJA as supplemental legislation, regulatory guidance, or evolving technical interpretations become available. See discussion below under "Income Tax Expense" for further information about the tax benefits and expenses that we recognized this year. As a result of the TCJA, we expect that the effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 will be approximately 24.5%. In fiscal 2018 and future years, we may invest a portion of any savings generated by the TCJA into expenses that could significantly increase and impact the comparability between periods of Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and Operating Income. We have a proven and highly profitable store model that has produced consistent financial results and returns and our new stores have achieved average payback periods of less than one year. Our new store model assumes a store size of approximately 8,000 square feet that achieves annual sales of approximately $1.6 million in the first full year of operation. Our new store model also assumes an average new store investment of approximately $0.3 million. Our new store investment includes our store build-out (net of tenant allowances), inventory (net of payables) and cash pre-opening expenses. Our planned store expansion will place increased demands on our operational, managerial, administrative and other resources. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to maintain adequate distribution capacity, enhance our store management systems, financial and management controls, information systems and other operational system capabilities. In addition, we will be required to hire, train and retain store management and other qualified personnel. For further information, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors-Risk Relating to our Business and Industry. Over the past five years we have invested a significant amount of capital in infrastructure and systems necessary to support our future growth and we expect to incur additional capital expenditures related to expansion of our infrastructure and systems in future periods. In fiscal 2013, we opened our second distribution center in Olive Branch, Mississippi and expanded our corporate headquarters to support our growth. In June 2015, we opened a new distribution center in Pedricktown, New Jersey to support our anticipated growth. We occupy approximately 800,000 square feet in our Pedricktown, New Jersey distribution center and will expand to approximately one million square feet by 2019. We are planning to lease or build new distribution centers that will open in the Southeast in 2019, the Southwest in 2020, and the Midwest in 2021 to support our growth objectives. In fiscal 2015, we invested in a new ERP and began the multi-year implementation of the ERP, which is designed to enhance functionality and provide timely information to the Company's management team related to the operation of the business. In September 2016, we signed a 15-year lease for a new corporate headquarters location in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to accommodate our current and anticipated future growth. We currently occupy approximately 117,000 square feet of office space and will expand into approximately 50,000 square feet of additional office space by no later than 2020. In addition, the timing and amount of investments in our infrastructure and systems could affect the comparability of our results of operations in future periods. We continuously assess ways to maximize the productivity and efficiency of our existing facilities, infrastructure and systems. The timing and amount of investments in our facilities, infrastructure and systems could affect the comparability of our results of operations in future periods. The completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to construction-related or other reasons. We believe our business strategy will continue to offer significant opportunity, but it also presents risks and challenges. These risks and challenges include, but are not limited to, that we may not be able to effectively identify and respond to changing trends and customer preferences, that we may not be able to find desirable locations for new stores and that we may not be able to effectively manage our future growth. In addition, our financial results can be expected to be directly impacted by substantial increases in product costs due to commodity cost increases or general inflation which could lead to a reduction in our sales as well as greater margin pressure as costs may not be able to be passed on to consumers. To date, changes in commodity prices and general inflation have not materially impacted our business. In response to increasing commodity prices or general inflation, we seek to minimize the impact of such events by sourcing our merchandise from different vendors and changing our product mix. See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors for a description of these and other important factors that could adversely impact us and our results of operations. How We Assess the Performance of Our Business In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. These key measures include net sales, comparable sales, cost of goods sold and gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses and operating income. Net Sales Net sales constitute gross sales net of merchandise returns for damaged or defective goods. Net sales consist of sales from comparable stores, non-comparable stores, and e-commerce, which includes shipping and handling revenue. Revenue from the sale of gift cards is deferred and not included in net sales until the gift cards are redeemed to purchase merchandise. Our business is seasonal and as a result, our net sales fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Net sales are usually highest in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the year-end holiday season. 30 Comparable Sales Comparable sales include net sales from stores that have been open for at least 15 full months from their opening date, and e-commerce sales. Comparable stores include the following: Stores that have been remodeled while remaining open; Stores that have been relocated within the same trade area, to a location that is not significantly different in size, in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes; and Stores that have expanded, but are not significantly different in size, within their current locations. For stores that are relocated or expanded, the following periods are excluded when calculating comparable sales: The period beginning when the closing store receives its last merchandise delivery from one of our distribution centers through: the last day of the fiscal year in which the store was relocated or expanded (for stores that increased significantly in size); or the last day of the fiscal month in which the store re-opens (for all other stores); and The period beginning on the first anniversary of the date the store received its last merchandise delivery from one of our distribution centers through the first anniversary of the date the store re-opened. Comparable sales exclude the 53rd week of sales for 53-week fiscal years. Fiscal 2017 comparable sales were calculated using a 52-week comparable period through the week ending January 27, 2018. In the 52-week fiscal year subsequent to a 53-week fiscal year, we exclude the sales in the non-comparable week from the same-store sales calculation. There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales. As a result, data in this Annual Report regarding our comparable sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other retailers. Non-comparable sales are comprised of new store sales, sales for stores not open for a full 15 months, and sales from existing store relocation and expansion projects that were temporarily closed (or not receiving deliveries) and not included in comparable sales. Measuring the change in fiscal year-over-year comparable sales allows us to evaluate how our store base is performing. Various factors affect comparable sales, including: consumer preferences, buying trends and overall economic trends; our ability to identify and respond effectively to customer preferences and trends; our ability to provide an assortment of high-quality, trend-right and everyday product offerings that generate new and repeat visits to our stores; the customer experience we provide in our stores and online; the level of traffic near our locations in the power, community and lifestyle centers in which we operate; competition; changes in our merchandise mix; pricing; our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; the timing of promotional events and holidays; the timing of introduction of new merchandise and customer acceptance of new merchandise; our opening of new stores in the vicinity of existing stores; the number of items purchased per store visit; and weather conditions. Opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy. As we continue to pursue our growth strategy, we expect that a significant percentage of our net sales will continue to come from new stores not included in comparable sales. Accordingly, comparable sales is only one measure we use to assess the success of our growth strategy. 31 Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit Gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of goods sold. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of our net sales. Cost of goods sold reflects the direct costs of purchased merchandise and inbound freight, as well as shipping and handling costs, store occupancy, distribution and buying expenses. Shipping and handling costs include third-party fulfillment and shipping costs related to our e-commerce operations. Store occupancy costs include rent, common area maintenance, utilities and property taxes for all store locations. Distribution costs include costs for receiving, processing, warehousing and shipping of merchandise to or from our distribution centers and between store locations. Buying costs include compensation expense and other costs for our internal buying organization, including our merchandising and product development team and our planning and allocation group. These costs are significant and can be expected to continue to increase as our company grows. The components of our cost of goods sold may not be comparable to the components of cost of goods sold or similar measures of our competitors and other retailers. As a result, data in this Annual Report regarding our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors and other retailers. The variable component of our cost of goods sold is higher in higher volume quarters because the variable component of our cost of goods sold generally increases as net sales increase. We regularly analyze the components of gross profit as well as gross margin. Any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups, a significant increase in our use of markdowns, and a significant increase in inventory shrinkage or inability to generate sufficient sales leverage on the store occupancy, distribution and buying components of costs of goods sold could have an adverse impact on our gross profit and results of operations. Changes in the mix of our products may also impact our overall cost of goods sold. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses are composed of payroll and other compensation, marketing and advertising expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other selling and administrative expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales are usually higher in lower sales volume quarters and lower in higher sales volume quarters. The components of our SG&A expenses may not be comparable to those of other retailers. We expect that our SG&A expenses will increase in future periods due to our continuing store growth. In addition, any increase in future share-based grants or modifications will increase our share-based compensation expense included in SG&A. Operating Income Operating income equals gross profit less SG&A expenses. Operating income excludes interest expense or income, loss on debt extinguishment and income tax expense or benefit. We use operating income as an indicator of the productivity of our business and our ability to manage SG&A expenses. Operating income percentage measures operating income as a percentage of our net sales. 32 Results of Consolidated Operations The following tables summarize key components of our results of consolidated operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of our net sales. Fiscal Year 2017 2016 2015 (in millions, except total stores) Consolidated Statements of Operations Data (1) : Net sales $ 1,278.2 $ 1,000.4 $ 832.0 Cost of goods sold 814.8 643.4 540.0 Gross profit 463.4 357.0 291.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 306.0 243.1 199.0 Operating income 157.4 114.0 92.9 Interest income, net 1.5 0.3 Other expense 0.3 Income before income taxes 158.8 114.3 92.7 Income tax expense 56.4 42.4 35.0 Net income $ 102.5 $ 71.8 $ 57.7 Percentage of Net Sales (1) : Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 63.7 % 64.3 % 64.9 % Gross profit 36.3 % 35.7 % 35.1 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 23.9 % 24.3 % 23.9 % Operating income 12.3 % 11.4 % 11.2 % Interest income, net 0.1 % % % Other expense % % % Income before income taxes 12.4 % 11.4 % 11.1 % Income tax expense 4.4 % 4.2 % 4.2 % Net income 8.0 % 7.2 % 6.9 % Operational Data: Total stores at end of period 625 522 437 Comparable sales growth 6.5 % 2.0 % 3.4 % Average net sales per store (2) $ 2.2 $ 2.0 $ 2.0 (1) Components may not add to total due to rounding. (2) Only includes stores open during the full fiscal year. 33 Fiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016 Net Sales Net sales increased to $1,278.2 million in fiscal year 2017 from $1,000.4 million in fiscal year 2016 , an increase of $277.8 million , or 27.8% . The increase was the result of a non-comparable sales increase of $217.3 million and a comparable sales increase of $60.5 million . In fiscal year 2017 , we opened 103 net new stores compared to 85 net new stores in fiscal year 2016 . The increase in non-comparable sales was primarily driven by new stores that opened in fiscal 2017 and the number of stores that opened in fiscal 2016 but have not been open for 15 full months and includes approximately $15.7 million of sales contributed by the 53rd week in fiscal 2017. Comparable sales increased 6.5% for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 . This increase resulted from an increase of approximately 5.8% in the number of transactions and an increase of approximately 0.7% in the average dollar value of transactions. Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit Cost of goods sold increased to $814.8 million in fiscal year 2017 from $643.4 million in fiscal year 2016 , an increase of $171.4 million , or 26.6% . The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily the result of an increase in the merchandise costs of goods resulting from an increase in sales. Also contributing to the increase in cost of goods sold was an increase in store occupancy costs resulting from new store openings. Gross profit increased to $463.4 million in fiscal year 2017 from $357.0 million in fiscal year 2016 , an increase of $106.4 million , or 29.8% . Gross margin increased to 36.3% for fiscal year 2017 from 35.7% in fiscal year 2016 , an increase of approximately 60 basis points. The increase in gross margin was primarily the result of decreases as a percentage of sales in store occupancy costs and merchandise cost of goods sold. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $306.0 million in fiscal year 2017 from $243.1 million in fiscal year 2016 , an increase of $62.9 million , or 25.9% . As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 40 basis points to 23.9% in fiscal year 2017 compared to 24.3% in fiscal year 2016 . The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was the result of increases of $42.0 million in store-related expenses to support new store growth and our marketing initiatives and $20.9 million of corporate-related expenses. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased to $56.4 million in fiscal year 2017 from $42.4 million in fiscal year 2016 , an increase of $14.0 million , or approximately 33.0% . This increase in income tax expense was primarily the result of a $44.6 million increase in pre-tax net income. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 was 35.5% compared to 37.1% in fiscal year 2016 . The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by discrete items, which include the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting," with respect to the requirement to recognize excess income tax benefits or deficiencies as income tax benefit or expense in the consolidated statements of operations rather than as additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets, and the impact of tax reform as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA"). The TCJA includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact us, most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. We recorded an additional expense of $1.5 million in deferred income tax expense for the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset at the 21% tax rate. Additionally, and in accordance with Section 15 of the Internal Revenue Code, we utilized a blended rate of 33.7% for our fiscal 2017 tax year, by applying a prorated percentage of the number of days prior to and subsequent to the January 1, 2018 effective date as compared with the 35% for the 2016 tax year. The effect of this blended rate change is a benefit of $2.0 million . The TCJA also provides for acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27, 2017, as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018, including additional limitations on deductibility of executive compensation and employee meal benefits. As a result of the TCJA, we expect that the effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 will be approximately 24.5%. 34 The net $0.5 million benefit represents what we believe is the impact of the TCJA in the current year. As the benefit is based on currently available information and interpretations, which are continuing to evolve, the benefit should be considered provisional. We will continue to analyze additional information and guidance related to the TCJA as supplemental legislation, regulatory guidance, or evolving technical interpretations become available. The final impacts may differ from the recorded amounts as of February 3, 2018, and we will continue to refine such amounts within the measurement period provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. Net Income As a result of the foregoing, net income increased to $102.5 million in fiscal year 2017 from $71.8 million in fiscal year 2016 , an increase of approximately $30.7 million , or 42.6% . Fiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015 Net Sales Net sales increased to $1,000.4 million in fiscal year 2016 from $832.0 million in fiscal year 2015, an increase of $168.4 million, or 20.2%. The increase was the result of a non-comparable sales increase of $153.3 million and a comparable sales increase of $15.1 million. In fiscal year 2016, we opened 85 net new stores compared to 71 net new stores in fiscal year 2015. The increase in non-comparable sales was primarily driven by new stores that opened in fiscal 2016 and the number of stores that opened in fiscal 2015 but have not been open for 15 full months. Comparable sales increased 2.0% for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. This increase resulted from an increase of approximately 2.4% in the average dollar value of transactions partially offset by a decrease of approximately 0.4% in the number of transactions. Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit Cost of goods sold increased to $643.4 million in fiscal year 2016 from $540.0 million in fiscal year 2015, an increase of $103.4 million, or 19.1%. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily the result of an increase in the merchandise costs of goods resulting from an increase in sales. Also contributing to the increase in cost of goods sold was an increase in store occupancy costs resulting from new store openings and an increase in distribution costs, primarily due to the increase in net sales. Gross profit increased to $357.0 million in fiscal year 2016 from $291.9 million in fiscal year 2015, an increase of $65.1 million, or 22.3%. Gross margin increased to 35.7% for fiscal year 2016 from 35.1% in fiscal year 2015, an increase of approximately 60 basis points. The increase in gross margin was primarily the result of decreases as a percentage of sales in merchandise cost of goods sold and distribution costs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $243.1 million in fiscal year 2016 from $199.0 million in fiscal year 2015, an increase of $44.1 million, or 22.2%. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 40 basis points to 24.3% in fiscal year 2016 compared to 23.9% in fiscal year 2015. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was the result of increases of $32.5 million in store-related expenses to support new store growth and our marketing initiatives and $11.6 million of corporate-related expenses, which includes share-based compensation expense. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased to $42.4 million in fiscal year 2016 from $35.0 million in fiscal year 2015, an increase of $7.4 million, or approximately 21.3%. This increase in income tax expense was primarily the result of a $21.6 million increase in pre-tax net income. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 was 37.1% compared to 37.7% in fiscal year 2015. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by discrete items. Net Income As a result of the foregoing, net income increased to $71.8 million in fiscal year 2016 from $57.7 million in fiscal year 2015, an increase of approximately $14.1 million, or 24.5%. 35 Seasonality Our business is seasonal in nature with the highest level of net sales and net income generated in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the year-end holiday season and, therefore, operating results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year. To prepare for the holiday season, we must order and keep in stock more merchandise than we carry during other parts of the year. We expect inventory levels, along with an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, generally to reach their highest levels in the third and fourth fiscal quarters in anticipation of the increased net sales during the year-end holiday season. As a result of this seasonality, and generally because of variation in consumer spending habits, we experience fluctuations in net sales, net income and working capital requirements during the year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations. Our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures and working capital. Capital expenditures typically vary depending on the timing of new store openings and infrastructure-related investments. We plan to make capital expenditures of approximately $137 million in fiscal 2018 , which exclude the impact of tenant allowances, and which we expect to fund from cash generated from operations. We expect to incur approximately $38 million of our capital expenditure budget in fiscal 2018 to construct and open approximately 125 new stores, with the remainder projected to be spent on distribution centers, store relocations and remodels, our new corporate headquarters, and corporate infrastructure. Our primary working capital requirements are for the purchase of store inventory and payment of payroll, rent, other store operating costs and distribution costs. Our working capital requirements fluctuate during the year, rising in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as we take title to increasing quantities of inventory in anticipation of our peak, year-end holiday shopping season in the fourth fiscal quarter. Fluctuations in working capital are also driven by the timing of new store openings. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures and working capital requirements during the fiscal year with cash on hand, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our Amended Revolving Credit Facility and Revolving Credit Facility. When we have used our Amended Revolving Credit Facility and Revolving Credit Facility, the amount of indebtedness outstanding under it has tended to be the highest in the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. To the extent that we have drawn on the facility, we have paid down the borrowings before the end of the fiscal year with cash generated during our peak selling season in the fourth quarter. We did not have any direct borrowings under our Amended Revolving Credit Facility during fiscal year 2017 . On March 20, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $100 million of our stock through March 31, 2021, on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. There can be no assurances that any such repurchases will be completed, or as to the timing or amount of any repurchases. Based on our growth plans, we believe that our cash position which includes our cash equivalents and short-term investments, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under our Amended Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to finance our planned capital expenditures, authorized share repurchases and working capital requirements over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. If cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Amended Revolving Credit Facility are not sufficient or available to meet our requirements, then we will be required to obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future. There can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available to us when we need it or, if available, that the terms will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then-current shareholders. Cash Flows A summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities is presented in the following table (in millions): Fiscal Year 2017 2016 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 167.4 $ 106.6 $ 87.9 Net cash used in investing activities (139.2 ) (86.8 ) (99.4 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 8.4 3.1 1.4 Net increase (decrease) during period in cash and cash equivalents (1) $ 36.6 $ 23.0 $ (10.1 ) (1) Components may not add to total due to rounding. 36 Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017 was $167.4 million , an increase of $60.8 million compared to fiscal 2016 . The increase was primarily due to an increase in operating cash flows from store performance partially offset by an increase in income taxes paid. During fiscal 2017 , we added 103 net new stores and expect to add approximately 125 new stores in fiscal 2018 . Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2016 was $106.6 million, an increase of $18.7 million compared to fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in operating cash flows from store performance and a decrease in income taxes paid offset by changes in overall working capital. During fiscal 2016, we added 85 net new stores. Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 was $139.2 million , an increase of $52.4 million compared to fiscal 2016 . The increase was primarily due to increases in net purchases of investment securities and capital expenditures. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily for our new store construction, our corporate infrastructure, and our distribution facilities. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2016 was $86.8 million, a decrease of $12.6 million compared to fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in capital expenditures and net purchases of investment securities. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to cash outflows related to our new distribution center in Pedricktown, New Jersey during fiscal 2015. Cash Provided by Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2017 was $8.4 million , an increase of $5.2 million compared to fiscal 2016 . The increase was primarily the result of increases in the proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase common stock and vesting of restricted and performance-based restricted stock units and a decrease in the common shares withheld for taxes offset by a decrease in excess tax benefits related to exercises of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units driven by the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting," with respect to excess income tax benefits and deficiencies being classified as an operating activity rather than a financing activity. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2016 was $3.1 million, an increase of $1.7 million compared to fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily the result of increases in the proceeds from the exercise of options and excess tax benefits related to exercises of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units, partially offset by an increase in common shares withheld for taxes. Line of Credit On May 10, 2017, we entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Amended Loan and Security Agreement ), among Five Below Inc., Five Below Merchandising, Inc. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The Amended Loan and Security Agreement amends and restates the Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated June 12, 2013, among Five Below Inc., Five Below Merchandising, Inc. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, which governed the Revolving Credit Facility. 37 The Amended Loan and Security Agreement includes a revolving line of credit in the amount of up to $20.0 million (the Amended Revolving Credit Facility ). Pursuant to the Amended Loan and Security Agreement, advances under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility are no longer tied to a borrowing base; however, we are required to maintain eligible inventory at all times in an amount equal to at least $100.0 million. The Amended Revolving Credit Facility expires on the earliest to occur of (i) May 10, 2022 or (ii) an event of default. The Amended Revolving Credit Facility may be increased to up to $50.0 million, subject to certain conditions. The Amended Revolving Credit Facility also includes a $20.0 million sub limit for the issuance of letters of credit. The Amended Loan and Security Agreement reduces the interest rate payable on borrowings to be, at our option, a per annum rate equal to (a) a prime rate or (b) a LIBOR-based rate plus a margin of 1.00%. Letter of credit fees are equal to the interest rate payable on LIBOR-based loans. The interest rate and letter of credit fees under the Amended Loan and Security Agreement are subject to an increase of 2.00% per annum upon an event of default. The Amended Loan and Security Agreement removes restrictions related to our ability to pay or make dividends and distributions or repurchase our stock, but the Amended Loan and Security Agreement continues to include other customary negative and affirmative covenants including, among other things, limitations on our ability to (i) incur additional debt; (ii) create liens; (iii) make certain investments, loans and advances; (iv) sell assets; (v) engage in mergers or consolidations; or (vi) change our business. The Amended Loan and Security Agreement also removes the provisions that required us to make prepayments on outstanding Amended Revolving Credit Facility balances upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including those from the sale of certain assets. Amounts under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility may become due upon certain events of default including, among other things, our failure to comply with the Amended Revolving Credit Facility covenants, bankruptcy, default on certain other indebtedness or a change in control. Under the Amended Loan and Security Agreement, all obligations under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility continue to be guaranteed by our subsidiary and are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiary's assets. As of February 3, 2018 , we had approximately $20.0 million available on the line of credit. As of January 28, 2017 , the Company had approximately $20.0 million available on the line of credit of which $19.7 million was available and $0.3 million was issued on an outstanding letter of credit obligation. All obligations under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets and are guaranteed by our subsidiary. As of February 3, 2018 , we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to us under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and understanding of our consolidated results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. Our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 in our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report . Inventories Inventories consist of finished goods purchased for resale, including freight, and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, at the individual product level. Cost is determined on a weighted average cost method. The market value used in the lower of cost or market analysis is subject to the effects of consumer demands, customer preferences and the broader economy. The effects of the previously listed criteria are not controllable by management. Our management reviews inventory levels in order to identify obsolete and slow-moving merchandise as these factors can indicate a decline in the market value of inventory on hand. Inventory cost is reduced when the selling price less costs of disposal is below cost. We accrue an estimate for inventory shrink for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date. The shrink estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrink trends. These estimates are derived using available data and our historical experience. Our estimates may be impacted by changes in certain underlying assumptions and may not be indicative of future activity. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped and evaluated for 38 impairment at the lowest level of which there are identifiable cash flows, which is generally at a store level. Assets are reviewed for impairment using factors including, but not limited to, our future operating plans and projected cash flows. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then an impairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fair value is based on discounted future cash flows of the asset using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. In the event of a store closure, we will record an impairment charge, if appropriate, or accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life of the asset. Based on the analysis performed, our management believes that there was no impairment of long-lived assets for each of the 2017 , 2016 and 2015 fiscal years. The impairment loss analysis requires management to apply judgment and make estimates. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset-and-liability method . Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, our management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Our management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") was enacted. The TCJA includes a numbers of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact us, most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. We will continue to analyze additional information and guidance related to the TCJA as supplemental legislation, regulatory guidance, or evolving technical interpretations become available. In fiscal 2018 and future years, we may invest a portion of any savings generated by the TCJA into expenses that could significantly increase and impact the comparability between periods of Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and Operating Income. Share-Based Compensation Our share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the employee's requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). We recognize compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value of restricted stock units ("RSU") and performance-based restricted stock units ("PSU"). RSU and PSU vest in accordance with vesting conditions set by the compensation committee of our board of directors. RSU's granted to date have vesting periods ranging from less than one year to five years from the date of grant. PSU's granted to date have vesting periods ranging from one year to five years from the date of grant, including grants that have a cumulative three year performance period, subject to satisfaction of the applicable performance goals established for the respective grant. We periodically assess the probability of achievement of the performance criteria and adjusts the amount of compensation expense accordingly. Compensation is recognized over the vesting period and adjusted for the probability of achievement of the performance criteria. We recognize compensation expense based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for grants of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option-pricing model is affected by a number of assumptions, such as our common stock fair value, our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options, stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. As a result, if any of the inputs or assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model change significantly, share-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously. There are significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of fair value of share-based awards. These judgments and estimates include determinations of an appropriate valuation method and the selection of appropriate inputs to be used in the valuation model. The use of alternative assumptions, including expected term, volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield, could cause share-based compensation to differ significantly from what has been recorded in the past. 39 Future share-based compensation cost will increase when we grant additional equity awards. Modifications, cancellations or repurchases of awards may require us to accelerate any remaining unearned share-based compensation cost or incur additional cost. The fair value of restricted stock awards are based on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date and the fair value of stock options are based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model utilizing the closing price of our common stock on the grant date as the fair value of common stock in the model. We utilize the simplified method to estimate the expected term of the option. The expected volatility incorporates historical and implied volatility of similar entities whose share prices are publicly available. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." ASU 2014-09 clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The update outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date." ASU 2015-14 deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. In the first six months of fiscal 2016, the FASB issued guidance clarifying the interpretation of certain principles of ASU 2014-09. On the effective date, we will adopt the provisions of ASU 2014-09 on a modified retrospective basis through an immaterial cumulative adjustment that will impact the opening balance of retained earnings related to the recognition of gift card breakage. These estimates may be refined as we finalize the implementation effort required to adopt the standard. In order to determine the impact of ASU 2014-09, our assessment included a detailed review of our revenue streams and a comparison of our historical accounting policies and practices to the new standard. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires that lease arrangements longer than 12 months result in an entity recognizing an asset and a liability. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The standard requires use of the modified retrospective transition approach. While we are currently evaluating this standard, given the significant amount of leases that we are party to, we expect this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements from the recognition of right to use assets and related liabilities. We plan to adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, coinciding with the standard effective date. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." ASU 2016-09 affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. This accounting standards update makes several modifications to the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the requirement that the excess income tax benefits or deficiencies that arise when the tax consequences of share-based compensation differ from amounts previously recognized in the consolidated statement of operations be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the consolidated statement of operations rather than as additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet. The guidance also clarifies the classification of components of share-based awards on the consolidated statement of cash flows such that excess income tax benefits should not be presented separately from other income taxes in the consolidated statement of cash flows and, thus, should be classified as an operating activity rather than a financing activity as they are under the current guidance. ASU 2016-09 is effective for financial statements issued for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years. We adopted this standard prospectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This standard will result in a decrease or increase to our effective tax rate, net income, and earnings per share based upon the requirement to recognize the excess income tax benefits or deficiencies in the consolidated statements of operations and change our earnings per share calculation to exclude excess tax benefits previously assumed under the treasury stock method. No changes were required related to the classification of employee taxes paid for withheld shares in our consolidated statements of cash flows since we have historically classified these within financing cash flows. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes, as of February 3, 2018 , our minimum rental commitments under operating lease agreements including assumed extensions, minimum payments for long-term debt and other obligations in future periods: 40 (In millions) Payments Due By Period Total (1) Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Operating lease obligations (2) $ 948.0 $ 117.6 $ 244.1 $ 220.4 $ 365.9 Purchase obligations (3) 4.9 4.9 Total $ 952.9 $ 122.5 $ 244.1 $ 220.4 $ 365.9 (1) The amounts in this table exclude obligations under employment agreements. For a discussion of the compensation of our executive officers, see Part III, Item 11 Executive Compensation . (2) Our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and include renewal options on substantially the same terms and conditions as the original lease. Also included in operating leases are our leases for the corporate office, distribution centers and other. (3) Purchase obligations are primarily for materials that will be used in the construction of new stores and purchase commitments for infrastructure and systems that will be used by the corporate office and distribution centers. From February 4, 2018 to March 22, 2018 , we committed to 15 new store leases with terms of 10 years that have future minimum lease payments of approximately $28.9 million . Off Balance Sheet Arrangements For the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018 , except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, net sales, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
