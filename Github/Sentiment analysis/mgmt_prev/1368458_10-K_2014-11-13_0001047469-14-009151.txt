In connection with the authorization of the 2014 Share Repurchase Program, the 2013 Share Repurchase Program was terminated. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 12.6 million shares of our common stock under the 2013 Share Repurchase Program at an aggregate cost of $333.3 million. Overview Description of Business At September 30, 2014, we operated primarily through two business units, Sally Beauty Supply and Beauty Systems Group, or BSG. As of September 30, 2014, through Sally Beauty Supply and BSG, we had a multi-channel platform of 4,647 company-operated stores and supplied 181 franchised stores primarily in North America and selected South American and European countries.

Within BSG, we also have one of the largest networks of professional distributor sales consultants in North America. We provide our customers with a wide variety of leading third-party branded and exclusive-label professional beauty supplies, including hair color products, hair care products, styling appliances, skin and nail care products and other beauty items.

For the year ended September 30, 2014, our consolidated net sales and operating earnings were $3,753.5 million and $507.0 million, respectively.

We believe BSG is the largest full-service distributor of professional beauty supplies in North America, exclusively targeting salons and salon professionals. As of September 30, 2014, BSG had 1,103 41 Table of Contents company-operated stores, supplied 162 franchised stores and had a sales force of approximately 981 professional distributor sales consultants selling exclusively to salons and salon professionals in all states in the U.S., and in Canada, Puerto Rico, Mexico and certain European countries. Company-operated BSG stores, which primarily operate under the CosmoProf banner, average approximately 2,600 square feet in size and are primarily located in secondary strip shopping centers. BSG stores provide a comprehensive selection of beauty products featuring an average of 9,000 SKUs that include hair color and care, skin and nail care, beauty sundries and electrical appliances.

BSG stores carry leading third-party brands such as Paul Mitchell , Wella , Sebastian , Goldwell , Joico and Aquage , intended for use in salons and for resale by the salons to consumers. BSG is also the exclusive source for certain well-known third-party branded products pursuant to exclusive distribution agreements with certain suppliers within specified geographic territories. For the year ended September 30, 2014, BSG's net sales and segment operating profit were $1,444.8 million and $217.0 million, respectively, representing 38% and 33% of our consolidated net sales and consolidated operating profit before unallocated corporate expenses and share-based compensation expenses, respectively. Key Industry and Business Trends We operate primarily within the large and growing U.S. professional beauty supply industry. We believe that a number of key industry and business trends and characteristics will influence our business and our financial results going forward. These key trends and characteristics are discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report. Please see "Key Industry and Business Trends" in Item 1 of this Annual Report. Significant Recent Acquisitions Essential Salon On May 31, 2013, the Company acquired certain assets and business operations of Essential Salon Products, Inc. ("Essential Salon"), a professional-only distributor of beauty products operating in the northeastern region of the United States, for approximately $15.7 million, subject to certain adjustments. The results of operations of Essential Salon are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition date. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets subject to amortization of $9.1 million, were recorded based on their preliminary estimated fair values at the acquisition date. In addition, goodwill of $3.1 million (which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes) was recorded as a result of this acquisition. We funded this acquisition with cash from operations. The Floral Group In the fiscal year 2012, the Company acquired Floral Group, then a 19-store distributor of professional beauty products based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, for approximately 22.8 million (approximately $31.2 million). The assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets subject to amortization of $11.8 million, were recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date and goodwill of $15.0 million (which is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes) was recorded as a result of this acquisition. The results of operations of the Floral Group are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition date. The acquisition was funded with cash from operations and with borrowings under our ABL facility in the amount of approximately $17.0 million. In addition to these acquisitions, we completed several other individually immaterial acquisitions during the fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 at the aggregate cost of approximately $4.9 million, $6.8 million and $12.8 million, respectively. We recorded additional intangible assets subject to amortization of $1.4 million and $4.0 million in connection with these individually immaterial acquisitions completed in the fiscal year 2014 and 2013, respectively. Additionally, we recorded additional goodwill in the amount of $2.6 million, $2.0 million and $9.4 million, the majority of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes, in connection with these individually immaterial acquisitions completed in the fiscal year 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Generally, we funded these acquisitions with cash from operations or borrowings under 42 Table of Contents the ABL facility. The valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with these acquisitions was based on their fair values at the acquisition date. Share Repurchase Programs In March 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $700.0 million of our common stock (the "2013 Share Repurchase Program"). In addition, in August 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock over the period from August 20, 2014 to September 30, 2017 (the "2014 Share Repurchase Program"). In connection with the authorization of the 2014 Share Repurchase Program, the 2013 Share Repurchase Program was terminated. Prior to termination of the 2013 Share Repurchase Program, the Company had repurchased and retired approximately 21.1 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $576.6 million under the 2013 Share Repurchase Program. The 2014 Share Repurchase Program expires on September 30, 2017. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 12.6 million shares of our common stock under the 2013 Share Repurchase Program at a cost of $333.3 million. We reduced common stock and additional paid-in capital, in the aggregate, by these amounts. As required by GAAP, we recorded into accumulated deficit any amounts paid to repurchase shares in excess of the balance of additional paid-in capital. We funded these share repurchases with cash from operations, borrowings under the ABL facility and a portion of the cash proceeds from our October 2013 debt issuance. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 18.9 million shares of our common stock under the 2013 Share Repurchase Program and the 2012 Share Repurchase Program (a share repurchase program approved by our Board in August 2012 and terminated in connection with the authorization of the 2013 Share Repurchase Program) at a cost of $509.7 million. We reduced common stock and additional paid-in capital, in the aggregate, by these amounts. We funded these share repurchases with a portion of the cash proceeds from our September 2012 debt issuance, cash from operations and borrowings under the ABL facility. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, we repurchased and retired approximately 7.6 million shares of our common stock from two venture capital investment funds associated with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC at a cost of $200.0 million. Data Security Incident In March 2014, the Company disclosed that it had experienced a data security incident in February 2014. The data security incident involved the unauthorized installation of malicious software (malware) on certain of our information technology systems, including our Sally Beauty Supply unit's point-of-sale systems that, we believe, may have illegally accessed and removed a portion of the payment card data (track 2) related to some transactions on our systems primarily during the period from February 21, 2014 to February 28, 2014. The costs that we have incurred to date in connection with the data security incident primarily include professional advisory and legal costs relating to our investigation of the data security incident. We may incur additional costs and expenses related to the data security incident in the future. These costs may result from potential liabilities to payment card networks, governmental or third party investigations, proceedings or litigation and legal and other fees necessary to defend against any potential liabilities or claims. At this time, we are unable to determine the probability of or to reasonably estimate the extent of these potential liabilities or a range thereof. The potential liabilities or other remedies against us related to the data security incident may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. Please see "Risk Factors We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems ," " Unauthorized access to confidential information and data on our information technology systems and security and data breaches could materially adversely affect our business, 43 Table of Contents financial condition and operating results " and " We experienced a data security incident and are not yet able to determine the full extent or scope of the potential liabilities relating to this data security incident ." Other Significant Items Derivative Instruments As a multinational corporation, we are subject to certain market risks including changes in market interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. We may consider a variety of practices in the ordinary course of business to manage these market risks, including, when deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and foreign currency options, collars and forwards (hereafter, "foreign exchange contracts"). Currently, we do not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Foreign Currency Derivative Instruments We are exposed to potential gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments in subsidiaries (including intercompany balances not permanently invested) and earnings denominated in foreign currencies, as well as exposure resulting from the purchase of merchandise by certain of our subsidiaries in a currency other than their functional currency and from the sale of products and services among the parent company and subsidiaries with a functional currency different from the parent or among subsidiaries with different functional currencies. Our primary exposures are to changes in exchange rates for the U.S. dollar versus the Euro, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Chilean peso, and the Mexican peso. In addition, from time to time we may have exposure to changes in the exchange rate for the British pound sterling versus the Euro in connection with the sale of products and services among certain European subsidiaries of the Company. Our various foreign currency exposures at times offset each other, sometimes providing a natural hedge against foreign currency risk. In connection with the remaining foreign currency risk, the Company from time to time uses foreign exchange contracts to effectively fix the foreign currency exchange rate applicable to specific anticipated foreign currency-denominated cash flows, thus limiting the potential fluctuations in such cash flows resulting from foreign currency market movements. The Company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the exposure to the U.S. dollar resulting from certain of its international subsidiaries' purchases of merchandise from third-party suppliers. These subsidiaries have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar their functional currency is either the British pound sterling or the Euro. As such, at September 30, 2014, we hold: (a) foreign currency forwards which enable us to sell approximately 6.5 million ($10.6 million, at the September 30, 2014 exchange rate) at the weighted average contractual exchange rate of 1.6277 and (b) foreign currency forwards which enable us to sell approximately 10.8 million ($13.7 million, at the September 30, 2014 exchange rate) at the weighted average contractual exchange rate of 1.2903. These foreign currency forwards expire ratably through September 21, 2015. The Company also uses foreign exchange contracts to mitigate its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with certain intercompany balances not permanently invested. As such, at September 30, 2014, we hold: (a) a foreign currency forward which enables us to sell approximately 17.0 million ($21.4 million, at the September 30, 2014 exchange rate) at the contractual exchange rate of 1.2690, (b) a foreign currency forward which enables us to sell approximately $2.1 million Canadian dollars ($1.9 million, at the September 30, 2014 exchange rate) at the contractual exchange rate of 1.1210, (c) a foreign currency forward which enables us to buy approximately $12.7 million Canadian dollars ($11.4 million, at the September 30, 2014 exchange rate) at the contractual exchange rate of 1.1183, (d) a foreign currency forward which enables us to sell approximately 32.6 million Mexican pesos ($2.4 million, at the September 30, 2014 exchange rate) at the contractual exchange rate of 13.4525 and (e) a foreign currency forward which enables us to buy approximately 1.2 million ($2.0 million, at the September 30, 2014 exchange rate) at the contractual exchange rate of 1.6234. All the foreign currency forwards discussed in this paragraph expire on or before December 31, 2014. 44 Table of Contents In addition, the Company uses foreign exchange contracts including, at September 30, 2014, foreign currency forwards with an aggregate notional amount of 3.0 million ($4.9 million, at the September 30, 2014 exchange rate) to mitigate the exposure to the British pound sterling resulting from the sale of products and services among certain European subsidiaries of the Company. The foreign currency forwards discussed in this paragraph enable the Company to buy British pound sterling in exchange for Euro currency at the weighted average contractual exchange rate of 0.7976 and expire ratably through September 30, 2015. At September 30, 2014, all of the Company's foreign exchange contracts are with a single counterparty. The Company's foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and do not currently meet the requirements for hedge accounting. Accordingly, the changes in the fair value (i.e., marked-to-market adjustments) of these derivative instruments (which are adjusted quarterly) are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, selling, general and administrative expenses included $1.9 million in net gains from all of the Company's foreign exchange contracts, including marked-to-market adjustments. Please see "Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign currency exchange rate risk" and Note 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. Interest Rate Swap Agreements We and certain of our subsidiaries are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. In order to enhance our ability to manage risk relating to cash flow and interest rate exposure, we and/or our other subsidiaries who are borrowers under the ABL facility may from time to time enter into and maintain derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. At September 30, 2014, the Company held no interest rate swaps or similar derivative instruments. Share-Based Compensation Awards For the fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, total share-based compensation expenses charged against earnings, and included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $22.1 million, $19.2 million and $16.9 million, respectively, and resulted in an increase in additional paid-in capital by the same amounts. For the fiscal year 2014, share-based compensation expenses reflect a charge of $3.5 million in connection with the executive management transition plan discussed previously. Share-based compensation expenses for the fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 included $8.8 million (including the charge of $3.5 million in connection with the executive management transition plan), $5.9 million and $5.3 million, respectively, of accelerated expense related to certain retirement eligible employees who are eligible to continue vesting awards upon retirement under the terms of the Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. Amended and Restated 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "2010 Plan") and certain predecessor plans, such as the Sally Beauty Holdings 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan. For the fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, the total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings from all share-based compensation plans in which our employees participate or participated was $8.2 million, $7.1 million and $6.2 million, respectively, and resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets by generally the same amounts. Our consolidated statements of cash flows reflect, for the fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, excess tax benefits of $14.6 million, $15.4 million and $14.4 million, respectively, from employee exercises of stock options as financing cash flows. As of September 30, 2014, we had $13.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock option awards that is expected to be charged to expense over the weighted average period of 2.3 years, and $3.4 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock awards that is expected to be charged to expense over the weighted average period of 3.4 years. 45 Table of Contents Non-recurring Items For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, selling, general and administrative expenses reflect a charge of $2.5 million (consisting primary of professional advisory and legal costs) related to the data security incident and a charge of $3.5 million for share-based compensation in connection with the executive management transition plan discussed earlier. Based upon an unfavorable verdict rendered in November 2012 in certain actions brought against the Company in March 2011, we recorded $10.2 million in legal settlement costs as of September 30, 2012, which we believed to be our best estimate of the potential loss. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, the parties continued to engage in negotiations aimed at resolving the matter and, in November 2012, entered into a settlement agreement whereby the Company agreed to pay the plaintiff the one-time cash sum of $8.5 million and agreed to certain other terms of settlement in exchange for a full release of claims. In addition, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, interest expense reflects charges of $37.8 million (including approximately $24.4 million in call premiums paid and approximately $13.4 million in unamortized deferred financing costs expensed) related to our redemption of certain outstanding senior notes and our repayment in full of a term loan in the ordinary course of our business. Please see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for more information about the Company's debt. Further, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, we recognized tax benefits (approximately $10.3 million) resulting from a limited restructuring, for U.S. income tax purposes, completed in that fiscal year. As a result, the effective income tax rate for the fiscal year 2012 (35.4%) was lower than our average historical effective tax rate of approximately 37.0%.

Our net sales consist primarily of the following: Sally Beauty Supply. Sally Beauty Supply generates net sales primarily by selling products through its stores to both retail customers and salon professionals. Sally Beauty Supply sells products for hair color and care, skin and nail care, beauty sundries and electrical appliances. Because approximately 45% of our Sally Beauty Supply product sales come from exclusive-label brands, most of these same products are generally not available in most other retail stores or in our BSG business segment. Various factors influence Sally Beauty Supply's net sales including overall consumer traffic, local competition, inclement weather, product assortment and availability, price, hours of operation, and marketing and promotional activity. Sally Beauty Supply's product assortment and sales are generally not seasonal in nature. Beauty Systems Group. BSG generates net sales primarily by selling products to salons and salon professionals through company-operated and franchised stores as well as through its network of professional distributor sales consultants. BSG sells products for hair color and care, skin and nail care, beauty sundries and electrical appliances. These products are not sold directly to the general public and are generally not the same products as those sold in our Sally Beauty Supply stores. Various factors influence BSG's net sales, including product features and availability, competition, relationships with suppliers, new product introductions and price. BSG's product assortment and sales are generally not seasonal in nature. Cost of Products Sold and Distribution Expenses. Cost of products sold and distribution expenses consist of the cost to purchase merchandise from suppliers and certain overhead expenses including procurement costs, freight from distribution centers to stores and merchandise handling costs at the distribution centers. Cost of products sold and distribution expenses are reduced by vendor rebates and allowances earned and by store inventory shrinkage, which represents products that are lost, stolen or damaged at the store level. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including share-based compensation expenses), commissions paid to professional distributor sales consultants, employee benefits, utilities, property maintenance, advertising costs, rent, insurance, freight and distribution expenses for delivery to customers, administrative costs and costs associated with our corporate support center. Interest Expense. Interest expense includes the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and is stated net of interest income. 49 Table of Contents The Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2014 compared to the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2013 The table below presents net sales, gross profit and gross profit margin data for each reportable segment (dollars in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2014 2013 Increase (Decrease) Net sales: Sally Beauty Supply $ 2,308,743 $ 2,230,028 $ 78,715 3.5 % BSG 1,444,755 1,392,188 52,567 3.8 % Consolidated net sales $ 3,753,498 $ 3,622,216 $ 131,282 3.6 % Gross profit: Sally Beauty Supply $ 1,265,785 $ 1,223,378 $ 42,407 3.5 % BSG 594,387 571,885 22,502 3.9 % Consolidated gross profit $ 1,860,172 $ 1,795,263 $ 64,909 3.6 % Gross profit margin: Sally Beauty Supply 54.8 % 54.9 % (0.1 )% BSG 41.1 % 41.1 % 0.0 % Consolidated gross profit margin 49.6 % 49.6 % 0.0 % Net Sales Consolidated Net Sales. Consolidated net sales increased by $131.3 million, or 3.6%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Company-operated Sally Beauty Supply and BSG stores that have been open for 14 months or longer contributed an increase in consolidated net sales of approximately $120.2 million, or 3.3%. Other sales channels (including sales from stores that have been open for less than 14 months, incremental sales from businesses acquired in the preceding 12 months, sales through our BSG franchise-based businesses and distributor sales consultants, and sales from our Sally Beauty Supply non-store sales channels) in the aggregate contributed a net increase in sales of approximately $11.1 million, or 0.3%, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our consolidated net sales. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, consolidated net sales reflect a 2.0% same store sales growth rate compared to a same store sales growth rate of 0.8% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, the consolidated same store sales growth rate was negatively impacted by lower traffic in the U.S. primarily driven by inclement weather that resulted in 6,157 store-closure days in the first six months of fiscal year 2014, compared to 1,906 in the prior year comparable period. However, the negative impact on consolidated same store sales resulting from inclement weather in the first six months of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 was offset by an improvement in same store sales in the second half of the fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, the consolidated same store sales growth rate was adversely impacted by lower non-Beauty Club Card traffic in the U.S. and a difficult comparison against strong growth in the prior year in certain of the Sally Beauty Supply segment's product categories (such as nail care and certain hair product lines). The $131.3 million increase in consolidated net sales is the result of increases in both unit volume (including increases in sales at existing stores and the incremental sales from 160 company-operated stores opened or acquired during the last twelve months) and average unit prices (resulting from changes in product mix), including the impact on average unit prices of third-party brands introduced recently at our Sally Beauty Supply segment. 50 Table of Contents Sally Beauty Supply. Net sales for Sally Beauty Supply increased by $78.7 million, or 3.5%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. In the Sally Beauty Supply segment, company-operated stores that have been open for 14 months or longer contributed an increase in segment net sales of approximately $80.7 million, or 3.6%. Certain other sales channels (including sales from stores that have been open for less than 14 months and sales from our non-store sales channels, which include the catalog and internet sales of our Sinelco Group subsidiaries) in the aggregate contributed an increase in sales of approximately $3.3 million, or 0.1%, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. On the other hand, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, incremental sales from businesses acquired in the preceding 12 months were $5.3 million with no comparable amount for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Net sales for Sally Beauty Supply for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, are inclusive of a positive impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $11.8 million. The $78.7 million increase in the Sally Beauty Supply segment's net sales is the result of increases in both unit volume (including increases in sales at existing stores and the incremental sales from 141 company-operated stores opened during the last twelve months) and average unit prices (resulting from changes in product mix), including the impact on average unit prices of certain third-party brands introduced recently. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, the Sally Beauty Supply segment's net sales reflect a 1.3% same store sales growth rate compared to a 0.6% negative growth rate for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, the Sally Beauty Supply segment's same store sales growth rate was negatively impacted by lower traffic in the U.S. driven primarily by inclement weather that resulted in 4,884 store closure days in the first six months of the fiscal year 2014, compared to 1,369 in the prior year comparable period. However, the negative impact on the Sally Beauty Supply segment's same store sales resulting from inclement weather in the first six months of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 was offset by an improvement in same store sales in the second half of the fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, the segment's negative same store sales growth rate was adversely impacted by lower non-Beauty Club Card traffic in the U.S. and a difficult comparison against strong growth in the prior year in certain of the Sally Beauty Supply segment's product categories, as discussed earlier. Beauty Systems Group. Net sales for BSG increased by $52.6 million, or 3.8%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. In the BSG segment, company-operated stores that have been open for 14 months or longer contributed an increase in segment net sales of approximately $39.4 million, or 2.8%. In addition, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, incremental sales from businesses acquired in the preceding 12 months were $6.4 million, or 0.5%, higher for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Other sales channels (including sales from stores that have been open for less than 14 months, sales through our distributor sales consultants and sales through our franchise-based businesses) in the aggregate contributed a net increase in sales of approximately $6.8 million, or 0.5%, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Net sales for BSG for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, are inclusive of a negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $6.7 million. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, the BSG segment's net sales reflect a 3.5% same store sales growth rate compared to 4.2% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, the BSG segment's same store sales growth rate was negatively impacted by lower traffic in the U.S. driven primarily by inclement weather that resulted in 1,273 store closure days in the first six months of the fiscal year 2014, compared to 537 in the prior year comparable period. The $52.6 million increase in the BSG segment's net sales is primarily the result of increases in unit volume (including increases in sales at existing stores and the incremental sales from 19 company-operated stores opened or acquired during the last twelve months). 51 Table of Contents Gross Profit Consolidated Gross Profit. Consolidated gross profit increased by $64.9 million, or 3.6%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, due to higher sales volume. Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or consolidated gross profit margin, was 49.6% for both the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our consolidated gross profit. Sally Beauty Supply. Sally Beauty Supply's gross profit increased by $42.4 million, or 3.5%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, due to higher sales volume. Sally Beauty Supply's gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 54.8% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to 54.9% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. The decline in gross profit margin was primarily the result of a shift in product mix (to lower margin product) in the U.S., including the impact of increases in sales of third-party brands, which generally have a lower gross profit margin for us than exclusive-label products. Beauty Systems Group. BSG's gross profit increased by $22.5 million, or 3.9%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, due to higher sales volume. BSG's gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 41.1% for both the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $70.8 million, or 5.9%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. This increase was attributable to incremental expenses (including employee compensation, rent and other occupancy-related expenses) resulting from stores opened and from businesses acquired in the preceding 12 months (160 additional company-operated stores added since September 30, 2013, a 3.6% increase), higher corporate expenses associated with our self-funded employee healthcare benefits program in the U.S. (approximately $11.4 million), higher advertising costs in the Sally Beauty Supply segment of $6.3 million, higher corporate expenses related primarily to on-going upgrades to our information technology systems (approximately $3.3 million) and an increase in our investments in new business development primarily at BSG's Loxa Beauty business (approximately $2.5 million). In addition, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, selling, general and administrative expenses reflect the charge of $2.5 million in connection with the data security incident and the $3.5 million share-based compensation charge in connection with the executive management transition plan mentioned earlier without a comparable amount for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 33.9% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to 33.2% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, mainly as a result of the expense increases and the charges mentioned earlier in this paragraph. Depreciation and Amortization Consolidated depreciation and amortization was $79.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to $72.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. This increase reflects the incremental depreciation and amortization expenses associated with businesses acquired in the preceding 12 months and with capital expenditures made in that period (mainly in connection with store openings in both operating segments and with ongoing information technology upgrades), partially offset by the impact of assets that became fully depreciated in the preceding 12 months. 52 Table of Contents Operating Earnings The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information concerning our operating earnings for each reportable segment (dollars in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2014 2013 Increase (Decrease) Operating Earnings: Segment operating profit: Sally Beauty Supply $ 431,655 $ 437,018 $ (5,363 ) (1.2) % BSG 216,971 200,492 16,479 8.2 % Segment operating profit 648,626 637,510 11,116 1.7 % Unallocated expenses (119,523 ) (97,947 ) 21,576 22.0 % Share-based compensation expense (22,107 ) (19,201 ) 2,906 15.1 % Operating earnings $ 506,996 $ 520,362 $ (13,366 ) (2.6) % Consolidated operating earnings decreased by $13.4 million, or 2.6%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. The decrease in consolidated operating earnings is primarily the result of higher unallocated expenses and share-based compensation expense and a decrease in the Sally Beauty Supply segment's operating profit, partially offset by an increase in the BSG segment's operating profit, as discussed below. Operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 13.5% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to 14.4% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. This decrease reflects higher consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales, including the $2.5 million charge in connection with the data security incident and the $3.5 million share-based compensation charge in connection with the executive management transition plan mentioned earlier. Sally Beauty Supply. Sally Beauty Supply's segment operating earnings decreased by $5.4 million, or 1.2%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. The decrease in the Sally Beauty Supply segment's operating earnings was primarily a result of the incremental costs related to 141 additional company-operated stores (stores opened during the past twelve months) operating during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, the incremental depreciation expense (approximately $3.8 million) associated with capital expenditures made in the preceding 12 months (mainly in connection with store openings and ongoing information technology upgrades), higher legal and professional fees of approximately $3.2 million and higher advertising costs of $6.3 million, partially offset by the increase in the Sally Beauty Supply segment's sales volume described above. Segment operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 18.7% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to 19.6% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. This decrease reflects higher segment operating expenses as a percentage of the segment's net sales primarily as a result of the expense increases mentioned earlier in this paragraph. Beauty Systems Group. BSG's segment operating earnings increased by $16.5 million, or 8.2%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, primarily as a result of increased sales volume, partially offset by the incremental costs related to 19 additional company-operated stores (stores opened or acquired during the past twelve months) operating during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 and investments in new business development (approximately $2.5 million). Segment operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 15.0% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to 14.4% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, primarily as a result of a reduction in the segment's operating expenses as a percentage of the segment's net sales. 53 Table of Contents Unallocated Expenses. Unallocated expenses, which represent certain corporate costs (such as payroll, employee benefits and travel expenses for corporate staff, certain professional fees, certain new business development expenses and corporate governance expenses) that have not been charged to our operating segments, increased by $21.6 million, or 22.0%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. This increase was due primarily to higher corporate expenses associated with our self-funded employee healthcare benefits program in the U.S. (approximately $11.4 million) and related to on-going upgrades to our information technology systems (approximately $3.3 million). In addition, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, unallocated expenses reflect the charge of $2.5 million in connection with the data security incident without a comparable amount for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Share-based Compensation Expense. Total compensation costs charged against income for share-based compensation arrangements increased by $2.9 million, or 15.1%, to $22.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to $19.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. This increase was primarily due to the impact of share-based awards made during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, including the $3.5 million share-based compensation charge in connection with the executive management transition plan described above, partially offset by the impact of share-based compensation awards that became fully vested during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Interest Expense Interest expense increased by $8.6 million, to $116.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Interest expense is net of interest income of approximately $0.2 million for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the effect of higher principal balances on our debt outstanding during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, including the senior notes due 2023 issued in October 2013. Please see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" contained elsewhere in this Annual Report and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for additional information about the Company's debt. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $144.7 million and $151.5 million and the annual effective tax rate was 37.0% and 36.7% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Net Earnings As a result of the foregoing, consolidated net earnings decreased by $15.2 million, or 5.8%, to $246.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to $261.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Net earnings, as a percentage of net sales, were 6.6% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to 7.2% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. 54 Table of Contents The Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2013 compared to the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2012 The table below presents net sales, gross profit and gross profit margin data for each reportable segment (dollars in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2013 2012 Increase Net sales: Sally Beauty Supply $ 2,230,028 $ 2,198,468 $ 31,560 1.4 % BSG 1,392,188 1,325,176 67,012 5.1 % Consolidated net sales $ 3,622,216 $ 3,523,644 $ 98,572 2.8 % Gross profit: Sally Beauty Supply $ 1,223,378 $ 1,199,342 $ 24,036 2.0 % BSG 571,885 543,917 27,968 5.1 % Consolidated gross profit $ 1,795,263 $ 1,743,259 $ 52,004 3.0 % Gross profit margin: Sally Beauty Supply 54.9 % 54.6 % 0.3 % BSG 41.1 % 41.0 % 0.1 % Consolidated gross profit margin 49.6 % 49.5 % 0.1 % Net Sales Consolidated Net Sales. Consolidated net sales increased by $98.6 million, or 2.8%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, primarily as a result of increases in unit volume, including increases in sales at existing stores and the incremental sales from the 172 company-operated stores opened or acquired during the last twelve months. Company-operated Sally Beauty Supply and BSG stores that have been open for 14 months or longer contributed an increase in consolidated net sales of approximately $105.7 million, or 3.0%, and certain other sales channels (including sales through our BSG franchise-based businesses and distributor sales consultants, and sales from our Sally Beauty Supply non-store sales channels), in the aggregate, contributed an increase in consolidated sales of approximately $37.6 million, or 1.1%, compared to fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. On the other hand, incremental sales from businesses acquired in the preceding 12 months were $28.9 million, or 0.8%, lower for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, mainly due to fewer acquisitions. Incremental sales from stores that have been open for less than 14 months were $15.8 million, or 0.5%, lower for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, in part due to fewer store openings and/or the timing of store openings. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our consolidated net sales. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, consolidated net sales reflect lower or negative same store sales growth rates, particularly in the Sally Beauty Supply segment's U.S. business, compared to very strong performance for the same stores in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. The consolidated same store sales growth rates for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 were adversely impacted by lower non-Beauty Club Card traffic in the U.S., as well as a difficult comparison against strong growth in certain Sally Beauty Supply product categories in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. Sally Beauty Supply. Net sales for Sally Beauty Supply increased by $31.6 million, or 1.4%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, primarily as a result of increases in unit volume, including the incremental sales from 119 company-operated stores opened or acquired during the last twelve months. In the Sally Beauty Supply segment, company-operated stores that have been open for 14 months or longer contributed an increase of approximately $47.9 million, 55 Table of Contents or 2.2%, and certain other sales channels (including sales from our non-store sales channels, which include sales through independent distributors in Europe (previously reported in sales from businesses acquired) and sales at trade shows), in the aggregate, contributed an increase of approximately $16.0 million, or 0.7%. Other the other hand, incremental sales from businesses acquired in the preceding 12 months were $22.5 million, or 1.0%, lower for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, mainly due to fewer acquisitions. Incremental sales from stores that have been open for less than 14 months were $9.9 million, or 0.5%, lower for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, in part due to fewer store openings and/or the timing of store openings. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our Sally Beauty Supply segment net sales. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, the Sally Beauty Supply segment's net sales reflect a negative 0.6% same store sales growth rate due to soft traffic in the U.S., compared to strong performance for the same stores in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. This decrease was partially offset by strong sales growth in the Sally Beauty Supply segment's international businesses. The Sally Beauty Supply segment's same store sales growth rate for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 was adversely impacted by lower non-Beauty Club Card traffic in the U.S., as well as a difficult comparison against strong growth in certain Sally Beauty Supply product categories (such as nail care and certain hair product lines) in fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, as discussed previously. Beauty Systems Group.

In the BSG segment, company-operated stores that have been open for 14 months or longer contributed an increase in segment net sales of approximately $57.7 million, or 4.4%, and sales through our distributor sales consultants contributed an increase of approximately $16.9 million, or 1.3%. On the other hand, certain other sales channels (including sales from businesses acquired in the preceding 12 months, sales from stores that have been open for less than 14 months and sales through our franchise-based businesses), in the aggregate, experienced a decrease in sales of approximately $7.6 million, or 0.6%, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, in part due to fewer acquisitions and/or the timing of acquisitions and store openings. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our BSG segment net sales. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, the BSG segment's net sales reflect a lower same store sales growth rate, compared to very strong performance for the same stores in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. Gross Profit Consolidated Gross Profit. Consolidated gross profit increased by $52.0 million, or 3.0%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, principally due to higher sales volume and improved gross profit margins in both business segments, as more fully described below. Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or consolidated gross profit margin, increased to 49.6% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to 49.5% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012.

Sally Beauty Supply's gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 54.9% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to 54.6% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. This increase was the result of a shift in product and 56 Table of Contents customer mix (including a year-over-year increase in sales of exclusive-label and other higher-margin products) and continued benefits from product cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by an increase in distribution expenses in the fiscal year 2013, particularly in some of the segment's international operations. Beauty Systems Group. BSG's gross profit increased by $28.0 million, or 5.1%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, principally as a result of higher sales volume and improved gross profit margins. BSG's gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 41.1% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to 41.0% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. This increase was principally as a result of a favorable change in the sales mix across the business, continued benefits from product cost reduction initiatives and a shift in channel mix (including a year-over-year increase in company-operated store sales as a percentage of total sales). Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $23.5 million, or 2.0%, to $1,202.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. This increase was attributable to incremental expenses (including employee compensation, rent and other occupancy-related expenses) resulting from stores opened, to a lesser extent, and from businesses acquired in the preceding 12 months (172 company-operated stores added since the fiscal year 2012, a 4.0% increase), as well as higher advertising expenses in the Sally Beauty Supply segment of $3.9 million, higher expenses related primarily to on-going upgrades to our information technology systems (including certain expenses associated with the Sally Beauty Supply point-of-sale system conversion and the international ERP system implementation) of approximately $2.6 million, and higher share-based compensation expense of $2.3 million, as described below. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, selling, general and administrative expenses reflect a $10.2 million charge resulting from a loss contingency settled in November 2012 without a comparable amount in the current fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 33.2% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 compared to 33.5% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. This decrease was due to a lower growth rate in selling, general and administrative expenses compared to the growth rate in net sales described above, principally the result of our current efforts to further control expenses in light of the softer sales growth experienced in our Sally Beauty Supply segment in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, partially offset by the expense increases mentioned earlier in this paragraph. Depreciation and Amortization Consolidated depreciation and amortization was $72.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to $64.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. This increase reflects the incremental depreciation and amortization expenses associated with capital expenditures (mainly in connection with store openings in both operating segments and ongoing information technology upgrades in the Sally Beauty Supply segment) made in the preceding 12 months and, to a lesser extent, with businesses acquired in that period, partially offset by the impact of assets that became fully depreciated in the preceding 12 months. 57 Table of Contents Operating Earnings The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information concerning our operating earnings for each reportable segment (dollars in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2013 2012 Increase Operating Earnings: Segment operating profit: Sally Beauty Supply $ 437,018 $ 429,520 $ 7,498 1.7 % BSG 200,492 182,699 17,793 9.7 % Segment operating profit 637,510 612,219 25,291 4.1 % Unallocated expenses (97,947 ) (96,012 ) 1,935 2.0 % Share-based compensation expense (19,201 ) (16,852 ) 2,349 13.9 % Operating earnings $ 520,362 $ 499,355 $ 21,007 4.2 % Consolidated operating earnings increased by $21.0 million, or 4.2%, to $520.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. The increase in consolidated operating earnings was due primarily to an increase in the operating profits of both segments, partially offset by higher unallocated expenses and share-based compensation expense, as more fully discussed below. Operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 14.4% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to 14.2% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. This increase reflects the increase in consolidated gross profit margin described above, as well as a reduction in consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales. Sally Beauty Supply. Sally Beauty Supply's segment operating earnings increased by $7.5 million, or 1.7%, to $437.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. The increase in Sally Beauty Supply's segment operating earnings was primarily a result of increased sales volume and improved gross profit margin. This increase was partially offset by the incremental costs related to 119 additional company-operated stores (stores opened or acquired during the past twelve months) operating during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, as well as higher advertising costs of $3.9 million and incremental depreciation expense (approximately $6.3 million) associated with capital expenditures (mainly in connection with store openings and with ongoing information technology upgrades) made in the preceding 12 months. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, Sally Beauty Supply's operating profit reflects a $10.2 million charge resulting from a loss contingency settled in November 2012 without a comparable expense in the current fiscal year. Segment operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 19.6% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to 19.5% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. This increase reflects the increase in the segment's gross profit margin described above, partially offset by an increase in the segment's operating expenses as a percentage of the segment's net sales. The increase in the segment's operating expenses as a percentage of the segment's net sales, was principally as a result of softer segment sales growth as discussed above. Beauty Systems Group. BSG's segment operating earnings increased by $17.8 million, or 9.7%, to $200.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, primarily as a result of increased sales volume and improved gross profit margin. Segment operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 14.4% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to 13.8% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. This increase reflects the increase in the segment's gross profit margin described above, as well as a reduction in the segment's operating expenses as a percentage of the segment's net sales. 58 Table of Contents Unallocated Expenses. Unallocated expenses, which represent corporate costs (such as payroll, employee benefits and travel expenses for corporate staff, certain professional fees, certain new business development expenses and corporate governance expenses) that have not been charged to our operating segments, increased by $1.9 million, or 2.0%, to $97.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. This increase was primarily due to corporate expenses, including depreciation and other expenses related to on-going upgrades to our information technology systems ($4.8 million) and to certain new business development activities, partially offset by lower employee compensation-related expenses of approximately $3.6 million. Share-based Compensation Expense. Total compensation costs charged against income for share-based compensation arrangements increased by $2.3 million, to $19.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. This increase was due to the incremental expenses related to, as well as the higher fair value at the grant date of, share-based awards during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to share-based awards during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, partially offset by the impact of share-based awards that became fully vested during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased by $30.7 million, to $107.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. Interest expense is net of interest income of $0.2 million for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 and 2012. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to losses on extinguishment of debt in the aggregate amount of $37.8 million in connection with our redemption of outstanding notes and our repayment in full of the borrowings under a senior term loan in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. This amount includes a call premium of approximately $24.4 million and unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately $13.4 million expensed in connection with such redemption and loan repayment. This decrease was partially offset by the effect of higher principal balances on our debt outstanding during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 (including the senior notes due 2019 and senior notes due 2022), compared to our debt outstanding during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. Please see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" contained elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information about the Company's interest rate swaps and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for additional information about the Company's debt. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $151.5 million and $127.9 million and the annual effective tax rate was 36.7% and 35.4% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The lower fiscal year 2012 annual effective tax rate, compared to our average historical effective tax rate of approximately 37.0%, was primarily due to tax benefits (approximately $10.3 million) resulting from a limited restructuring, for U.S. income tax purposes, completed in the fiscal year 2012. Net Earnings As a result of the foregoing, consolidated net earnings increased by $28.1 million, or 12.1%, to $261.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to $233.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. Net earnings, as a percentage of net sales, were 7.2% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to 6.6% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. 59 Table of Contents Financial Condition September 30, 2014 Compared to September 30, 2013 Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) increased by $167.4 million to $640.6 million at September 30, 2014, compared to $473.2 million at September 30, 2013. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.38 to 1.00 at September 30, 2014, compared to 1.87 to 1.00 at September 30, 2013. The increase in working capital reflects an increase in current assets of $88.3 million and a decrease in current liabilities of $79.1 million. The increase in current assets is principally due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $59.5 million (please see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for a description of our sources and uses of cash) and an increase of $20.1 million in inventory. The decrease in current liabilities is principally due to a decrease in current maturities of long-term debt of $77.0 million and a decrease of $14.0 million in accounts payable, partially offset by an increase of $14.0 million in accrued liabilities, as discussed below. Inventory increased by $20.1 million to $828.4 million at September 30, 2014, compared to $808.3 million at September 30, 2013 primarily due to the effect of stores opened or acquired (160 net additional company-operated stores added during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014) and the introduction of new third-party brands primarily in the Sally Beauty Supply segment during the fiscal year 2014. Accounts payable decreased by $14.0 million to $259.5 million at September 30, 2014, compared to $273.5 million at September 30, 2013 due to the timing of payments to suppliers primarily in connection with recent purchases of merchandise inventory and capital expenditures. Accrued liabilities increased by $14.0 million to $198.8 million at September 30, 2014, compared to $184.8 million at September 30, 2013, primarily due to the timing of payments of employee compensation and compensation-related expenses of $5.4 million and the incremental accrued interest related to our senior notes due 2023 of $4.6 million. Net property and equipment increased by $8.6 million to $238.1 million at September 30, 2014, compared to $229.5 million at September 30, 2013, primarily due to capital expenditures of $76.8 million, partially offset by the fiscal year 2014 depreciation expense of $65.1 million and foreign currency translation adjustments. Intangible assets, excluding goodwill, decreased by $15.4 million to $114.7 million at September 30, 2014, compared to $130.1 million at September 30, 2013, primarily due to amortization expense of $14.5 million recognized in the fiscal year 2014 and foreign currency translation adjustments. Long-term debt, including current portion, increased by $120.9 million to $1,811.6 million at September 30, 2014, compared to $1,690.7 million at September 30, 2013. This increase was primarily due to the issuance of $200.0 million principal amount of our senior notes due 2023 in October 2013, the proceeds of which were used to repay in full the then outstanding borrowings under the ABL facility and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. This increase was partially offset by our payment in full during fiscal year 2014 of the borrowings under the ABL facility of $76.0 million outstanding at September 30, 2013, which were included in current maturities of long-term debt. Please see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. Total stockholders' deficit increased by $43.6 million to $347.1 million at September 30, 2014 compared to $303.5 million at September 30, 2013. This increase was primarily as a result of our repurchase and subsequent retirement of approximately 12.6 million shares of our common stock for approximately $333.3 million and foreign currency translation adjustments, net of tax, of $18.7 million, partially offset by net earnings of $246.0 million and share-based compensation expense and the impact of exercises of stock options, in the aggregate, of approximately $62.5 million. Please see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. 60 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We broadly define liquidity as our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments. In addition, liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate debt and equity financing and to convert into cash those assets that are no longer required to meet existing strategic and financial objectives. Therefore, liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current or potentially available funds for use in achieving long-range business objectives and meeting debt service commitments. We are highly leveraged and a substantial portion of our liquidity needs will arise from debt service on our outstanding indebtedness and from funding the costs of operations, working capital, capital expenditures and share repurchases. As a holding company, we depend on our subsidiaries, including Sally Holdings LLC (which we refer to as "Sally Holdings"), to distribute funds to us so that we may pay our obligations and expenses. The ability of our subsidiaries to make such distributions will be subject to their operating results, cash requirements and financial condition and their compliance with relevant laws, and covenants and financial ratios related to their existing or future indebtedness, including covenants restricting Sally Holdings' ability to pay dividends to us. If, as a consequence of these limitations, we cannot receive sufficient distributions from our subsidiaries, we may not be able to meet our obligations to fund general corporate expenses. Please see "Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business," and " Risks Relating to Our Substantial Indebtedness." We may from time to time repurchase or otherwise retire or refinance our debt (through our subsidiaries or otherwise) and take other steps to reduce or refinance our debt. These actions may include open market repurchases of our notes or other retirements of outstanding debt. The amount of debt that may be repurchased, or refinanced or otherwise retired, if any, will be determined in the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on market conditions, trading levels of the Company's debt from time to time, the Company's cash position and other considerations. At September 30, 2014, cash and cash equivalents were $106.6 million. Based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth, we anticipate that existing cash balances, funds expected to be generated by operations and funds available under the ABL facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, fund share repurchases and potential acquisitions, and finance anticipated capital expenditures, including information technology upgrades, over the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that anticipated net sales and operating improvements will be realized, or that future borrowings will be available under our ABL facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, our ability to meet our debt service obligations and liquidity needs are subject to certain risks, which include, but are not limited to, increases in competitive activity, the loss of key suppliers, rising interest rates, the loss of key personnel, the ability to execute our business strategy, general economic conditions and other risks discussed in this Annual Report. Please see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Annual Report. We utilize our ABL facility for the issuance of letters of credit, for certain working capital and liquidity needs and to manage normal fluctuations in our operational cash flow. In that regard, we may from time to time draw funds under the ABL facility for general corporate purposes including funding of capital expenditures, acquisitions, interest payments due on our indebtedness and share repurchases. The funds drawn on an individual occasion during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 have varied in amounts up to $35.0 million, total amounts outstanding have ranged from zero up to $94.0 million and the average daily balance outstanding was $9.4 million. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings under the ABL facility was 2.45%. The amounts drawn are generally paid down with cash provided by our operating activities. 61 Table of Contents As of September 30, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the ABL facility and Sally Holdings had $476.0 million available for borrowings under the ABL facility, subject to borrowing base limitations, as reduced by outstanding letters of credit. We are a holding company and do not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of equity interests in our subsidiaries. The agreements and instruments governing the debt of Sally Holdings and its subsidiaries contain material limitations on their ability to pay dividends and other restricted payments to us which, in turn, constitute material limitations on our ability to pay dividends and other payments to our stockholders. Please see " Long-Term Debt Covenants " below. During the fiscal year 2014, we completed several individually immaterial acquisitions at an aggregate cost of $4.9 million and during the fiscal year 2013, we completed several acquisitions at an aggregate cost of $22.5 million. We funded these acquisitions with cash from operations and borrowings under the ABL facility. Share Repurchase Programs In March 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $700.0 million of our common stock (the "2013 Share Repurchase Program"). In addition, in August 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock over the period from August 20, 2014 to September 30, 2017 (the "2014 Share Repurchase Program"). In connection with the authorization of the 2014 Share Repurchase Program, the 2013 Share Repurchase Program was terminated. Prior to termination of the 2013 Share Repurchase Program, the Company had repurchased and retired approximately 21.1 million shares at a cost of $576.6 million under the 2013 Share Repurchase Program. The 2014 Share Repurchase Program expires on September 30, 2017. During the fiscal years 2014 and 2013, we repurchased and retired approximately 12.6 million and 18.9 million shares, respectively, of our common stock at a cost of $333.3 million and $509.7 million, respectively, under the 2013 Share Repurchase Program and the 2012 Share Repurchase Program (a share repurchase program approved by our Board in August 2012 and terminated in connection with the authorization of the 2013 Share Repurchase Program). We funded these share repurchases with a portion of the cash proceeds from our September 2012 and October 2013 debt issuances, cash from operations and borrowings under the ABL facility. Future repurchases of shares of our common stock are expected to be funded with existing cash balances, funds expected to be generated by operations and funds available under the ABL facility. In the fiscal year 2012, we repurchased (and subsequently retired) 7.6 million shares of our common stock from the CDR Investors, in a private transaction, at $26.485 per share. We funded this $200.0 million share repurchase primarily with borrowings in the amount of $160.0 million under our ABL facility and with cash from operations. Historical Cash Flows For the fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, our primary sources of cash have been funds provided by operating activities, our September 2012 and October 2013 debt issuances and, when necessary, borrowings under our ABL facility. The primary uses of cash during the past three years were for share repurchases, repayments of long-term debt, acquisitions and capital expenditures. 62 Table of Contents The following table shows our sources and uses of funds for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2014 2013 Change 2013 2012 Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 315,972 $ 310,454 $ 5,518 $ 310,454 $ 297,582 $ 12,872 Net cash used by investing activities (81,754 ) (106,977 ) 25,223 (106,977 ) (112,513 ) 5,536 Net cash used by financing activities (173,734 ) (396,775 ) 223,041 (396,775 ) (8,682 ) (388,093 ) Effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (1,024 ) 193 (1,217 ) 193 352 (159 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 59,460 $ (193,105 ) $ 252,565 $ (193,105 ) $ 176,739 $ (369,844 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 increased by $5.5 million to $316.0 million compared to $310.5 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. This increase was primarily due to net changes in the components of working capital in the normal course of our business, partially offset by lower net earnings ($15.2 million). Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 increased by $12.9 million to $310.5 million compared to $297.6 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. The increase was primarily due to an improvement of approximately $21.0 million in operating earnings, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. Net Cash Used by Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 decreased by $25.2 million to $81.8 million, compared to $107.0 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. This decrease reflects, in the Sally Beauty Supply segment, capital expenditures related to our opening of a distribution facility in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 without a comparable capital project in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, as well as lower expenditures in our point-of-sale system upgrade project in the U.S., as we get closer to completing that capital project. In addition, the decrease reflects less net cash used for acquisitions ($17.0 million) in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Net cash used by investing activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 decreased by $5.5 million to $107.0 million compared to $112.5 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. This change was primarily due to a decrease of $21.3 million in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, partially offset by an increase of $15.8 million in capital expenditures, primarily related to store openings, the opening of a distribution facility in the Sally Beauty Supply segment and ongoing information technology upgrades. Net Cash Used by Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities decreased by $223.0 million to $173.7 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to $396.8 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. 63 Table of Contents This decrease was primarily due to $176.4 million less cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. In addition, the decrease reflects our issuance of the senior notes due 2023 in October 2013 ($200.0 million), partially offset by our payment in full of borrowings under the ABL facility ($76.0 million) during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, as well as net borrowings of $76.0 million under the ABL facility of during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. Net cash used by financing activities increased by $388.1 million to $396.8 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, compared to $8.7 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. This increase was primarily due to an increase in cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock of $309.7 million, as well as a decrease in net borrowing under our credit facilities of $106.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in debt issuance costs paid of $29.3 million. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, we repurchased approximately 18.9 million shares of our common stock (under the 2012 Share Repurchase Program and the 2013 Share Repurchase Program) at a cost of $509.7 million. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, we repurchased approximately 7.6 million shares of our common stock from the CD&R Investors at a cost of $200.0 million. Long-Term Debt Outstanding Long-Term Debt In 2006, the Company, through its subsidiaries (Sally Investment Holdings LLC and Sally Holdings) incurred $1,850.0 million of indebtedness in connection with the Company's separation from its former parent, The Alberto-Culver Company, which we refer to as Alberto-Culver. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, Sally Holdings entered into a $400 million, five-year asset-based senior secured loan facility (the "ABL facility"). The availability of funds under the ABL facility, as amended in June 2012, is subject to a customary borrowing base comprised of: (i) a specified percentage of our eligible credit card and trade accounts receivable (as defined therein) and (ii) a specified percentage of our eligible inventory (as defined therein), and reduced by (iii) certain customary reserves and adjustments and by certain outstanding letters of credit. The ABL facility includes a $25.0 million Canadian sub-facility for our Canadian operations. In July 2013, the Company, Sally Holdings and other parties to the ABL facility entered into a second amendment to the ABL facility which, among other things, increased the maximum availability under the ABL Facility to $500.0 million (subject to borrowing base limitations), reduced pricing, relaxed the restrictions regarding the making of Restricted Payments, extended the maturity to July 2018 and improved certain other covenant terms. At September 30, 2014, the Company had $476.0 million available for borrowing under the ABL facility, including the Canadian sub-facility. In addition, the terms of the ABL facility contain a commitment fee of 0.25% on the unused portion of the facility. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, Sally Holdings and Sally Capital Inc. (collectively, the "Issuers"), both indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of their 6.875% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "senior notes due 2019") and $850.0 million aggregate principal amount of their 5.75% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "senior notes due 2022"), including $150.0 million of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes due 2022 issued at par plus a premium. Such premium is being amortized over the term of the senior notes due 2022 using the effective interest method. The net proceeds from these debt issuances were used to retire outstanding indebtedness in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $1,391.9 million (substantially all of which was incurred in 2006 in connection with our separation from Alberto-Culver) and for general corporate purposes. In connection with the issuances of the senior notes due 2022, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 the Company incurred and capitalized financing costs of approximately $16.0 million. This amount is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized over the term of the senior notes due 2022 using the effective interest method. 64 Table of Contents On October 29, 2013, the Issuers issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of their 5.5% Senior Notes due 2023 (the "senior notes due 2023") at par. The Company used the net proceeds from this debt issuance, approximately $196.3 million, to repay borrowings outstanding under the ABL facility of $88.5 million (which borrowings were primarily used to fund share repurchases) and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. In connection with the issuances of the senior notes due 2023, the Company incurred and capitalized financing costs of approximately $3.9 million. This amount is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized over the term of the senior notes due 2023 using the effective interest method. Details of long-term debt (excluding capitalized leases) as of September 30, 2014 are as follows (dollars in thousands): Amount Maturity Dates Interest Rates ABL facility(a) $ July 2018 (i) Prime plus (0.50% to 0.75%) or; (ii) LIBOR(a) plus (1.50% to 1.75%) Senior notes due 2019 750,000 Nov. 2019 6.875% Senior notes due 2022(b) 857,447 June 2022 5.75%(b) Senior notes due 2023 200,000 Nov. 2023 5.50% Other(c) 95 2015 5.15% to 5.79% Total $ 1,807,542 (a) When used in this Annual Report, LIBOR means the London Interbank Offered Rate.

Long-Term Debt Covenants We are a holding company and do not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of equity interests in our subsidiaries. The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business. These restrictions and limitations relate to: Incurrence of additional indebtedness Granting of liens on assets Repurchases and redemptions of capital stock and the payment of dividends Making of investments, including joint ventures Making of certain debt prepayments Making of acquisitions Mergers or consolidations Disposition of assets Borrowings under the ABL facility are secured by the accounts, inventory and credit card receivables of our domestic subsidiaries and Canadian subsidiaries (in the case of borrowings under the Canadian sub-facility), together with general intangibles and certain other personal property of our domestic subsidiaries and Canadian subsidiaries (in the case of borrowings under the Canadian sub-facility) relating to the accounts and inventory, as well as deposit accounts of our domestic subsidiaries and Canadian subsidiaries (in the case of borrowings under the Canadian sub-facility) and, solely with respect to borrowings by SBH Finance B.V., intercompany notes owed to SBH Finance B.V. by our foreign subsidiaries. The senior notes due 2019, the senior notes due 2022 and the senior notes due 2023 (which we refer to collectively as "the Notes" or the "senior notes due 2019, 2022 and 2023") are unsecured obligations of the Issuers and are jointly and severally guaranteed by the Company and Sally Investment, 65 Table of Contents and by each material domestic subsidiary of the Company. Interest on the senior notes due 2019, 2022 and 2023 is payable semi-annually, during the Company's first and third fiscal quarters. The ABL facility and the indentures governing the senior notes due 2019, 2022 and 2023 contain other covenants regarding restrictions on assets dispositions, granting of liens and security interests, prepayment of certain indebtedness and other matters and customary events of default, including customary cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions. As of September 30, 2014, all the net assets of our consolidated subsidiaries were unrestricted from transfer under our credit arrangements. The senior notes due 2019 carry optional redemption features whereby the Company has the option to redeem the notes, in whole or in part, on or after November 15, 2017 at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and on or after November 15, 2015 at par plus a premium declining ratably to par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Prior to November 15, 2015, the notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to par plus a make-whole premium as provided in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, on or prior to November 15, 2014, the Company has the right to redeem at par plus a specified premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of notes originally issued, subject to certain limitations, with the proceeds from certain kinds of equity offerings, as defined in the indenture. The senior notes due 2022 carry optional redemption features whereby the Company has the option to redeem the notes, in whole or in part, on or after June 1, 2020 at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and on or after June 1, 2017 at par plus a premium declining ratably to par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Prior to June 1, 2017, the notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to par plus a make-whole premium as provided in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, on or prior to June 1, 2015, the Company has the right to redeem at par plus a specified premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of notes originally issued, subject to certain limitations, with the proceeds from certain kinds of equity offerings, as defined in the indenture. The senior notes due 2023 carry optional redemption features whereby the Company has the option to redeem the notes, in whole or in part, on or after November 1, 2021 at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and on or after November 1, 2018 at par plus a premium declining ratably to par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Prior to November 1, 2018, the notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to par plus a make-whole premium as provided in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, on or prior to November 1, 2016, the Company has the right to redeem at par plus a specified premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of notes originally issued, subject to certain limitations, with the proceeds from certain kinds of equity offerings, as defined in the indenture. The ABL facility does not contain any restriction against the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness. However, the ABL facility restricts the incurrence of secured indebtedness if, after giving effect to the incurrence of such secured indebtedness, the Company's Secured Leverage Ratio exceeds 4.0 to 1.0. At September 30, 2014, the Company's Secured Leverage Ratio was less than 0.1 to 1.0. Secured Leverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) Secured Funded Indebtedness (as defined in the ABL facility) to (ii) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the ABL facility). The ABL facility is pre-payable and the commitments thereunder may be terminated, in whole or in part at any time without penalty or premium. The indentures governing the senior notes due 2019, 2022 and 2023 contain terms which restrict the ability of Sally Beauty's subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness. However, in addition to certain other material exceptions, the Company may incur additional indebtedness under the indentures if its Consolidated Coverage Ratio, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such indebtedness, exceeds 2.0 to 1.0 ("Incurrence Test"). At September 30, 2014, the Company's Consolidated Coverage Ratio was 66 Table of Contents approximately 5.6 to 1.0. Consolidated Coverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the indentures) for the period containing the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters, to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense (as defined in the indentures) for such period. The indentures governing the senior notes due 2019, 2022 and 2023 restrict Sally Holdings and its subsidiaries from making certain dividends and distributions to equity holders and certain other restricted payments (hereafter, a "Restricted Payment" or "Restricted Payments") to us. However, the indentures permit the making of such Restricted Payments if, at the time of the making of such Restricted Payment, the Company satisfies the Incurrence Test as described above and the cumulative amount of all Restricted Payments made since the issue date of the applicable senior notes does not exceed the sum of: (i) 50% of Sally Holdings' and its subsidiaries' cumulative consolidated net earnings since July 1, 2006, plus (ii) the proceeds from the issuance of certain equity securities or conversions of indebtedness to equity, in each case, since the issue date of the applicable senior notes plus (iii) the net reduction in investments in unrestricted subsidiaries since the issue date of the applicable senior notes plus (iv) the return of capital with respect to any sales or dispositions of certain minority investments since the issue date of the applicable senior notes. Further, in addition to certain other baskets, the indentures permit the Company to make additional Restricted Payments in an unlimited amount if, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of any indebtedness to make such Restricted Payment, the Company's Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the indentures) is less than 3.25 to 1.00. At September 30, 2014, the Company's Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio was approximately 2.8 to 1.0. Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) Consolidated Total Indebtedness, as defined in the indentures, minus cash and cash equivalents on-hand up to $100.0 million, in each case, as of the end of the most recently-ended fiscal quarter to (ii) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the indentures) for the period containing the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters. The ABL facility also restricts the making of Restricted Payments. More specifically, under the ABL facility, Sally Holdings may make Restricted Payments if availability under the ABL facility equals or exceeds certain thresholds, and no default then exists under the facility. For Restricted Payments up to $30.0 million during each fiscal year, borrowing availability must equal or exceed the lesser of $75.0 million or 15% of the borrowing base for 45 days prior to such Restricted Payment. For Restricted Payments in excess of that amount, borrowing availability must equal or exceed the lesser of $100.0 million or 20% of the borrowing base for 45 days prior to such Restricted Payment and the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined below) must equal or exceed 1.1 to 1.0. Further, if borrowing availability equals or exceeds the lesser of $150.0 million or 30% of the borrowing base, Restricted Payments are not limited by the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test. The Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the ABL facility) during the trailing twelve-month period preceding such proposed Restricted Payment minus certain unfinanced capital expenditures made during such period and income tax payments paid in cash during such period to (ii) fixed charges (as defined in the ABL facility). In addition, during any period that borrowing availability under the ABL facility is less than the greater of $40.0 million or 10% of the borrowing base, the level of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio that the Company must satisfy is 1.0 to 1.0. As of September 30, 2014, the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio was approximately 3.6 to 1.0. When used in this Annual Report, the phrase "Consolidated EBITDA" is intended to have the meaning ascribed to such phrase in the ABL facility or the indentures governing the senior notes due 2019, 2022 and 2023, as appropriate. EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and should not be considered a substitute for financial performance and liquidity measures determined in accordance with GAAP, such as net earnings, operating earnings and operating cash flows. We are currently in compliance with the agreements and instruments governing our debt, including our financial covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants in future periods will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which in turn will be subject to economic conditions and to 67 Table of Contents financial, market and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. Further, our ability to comply with these covenants in future periods will also depend substantially on the pricing of our products, our success at implementing cost reduction initiatives and our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy. Please see "Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Substantial Indebtedness." Capital Requirements During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we had total capital expenditures of approximately $76.8 million which were primarily to fund the addition of new stores and remodeling, expansion or relocation of existing stores in the ordinary course of our business, as well as ongoing information technology upgrades. For the fiscal year 2015, we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of approximately $95.0 million to $100.0 million, excluding acquisitions. Capital expenditures will be primarily to fund the addition of new stores and remodeling, expansion or relocation of existing stores, as well as certain corporate projects in the ordinary course of our business, including ongoing technology upgrades. Contractual Obligations The following table is a summary of our contractual cash obligations and commitments outstanding by future payment dates at September 30, 2014 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Total Long-term debt obligations, including interest obligations(a) $ 112,607 $ 224,752 $ 223,606 $ 1,982,549 $ 2,543,514 Obligations under operating leases(b) 166,505 257,493 131,959 70,430 626,387 Purchase obligations(c) 11,304 20,072 19,000 27,708 78,084 Other long-term obligations(d)(e) 17,147 10,641 4,777 6,538 39,103 Total $ 307,563 $ 512,958 $ 379,342 $ 2,087,225 $ 3,287,088 (a) Long-term debt obligations include capital leases and future interest payments on senior notes outstanding as of September 30, 2014. (b) In accordance with GAAP, these obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The amounts reported for operating leases do not include common area maintenance (CAM), property taxes or other executory costs. Please see Note 12 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" contained elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information about the Company's operating leases. The amounts reported above, do not include obligations of the Company's franchisees under operating leases of approximately $0.7 million for which the Company is contingently liable in the event of payment default by the franchisee. (c) Purchase obligations reflect legally binding agreements entered into by us to purchase goods or services, that specify minimum quantities to be purchased and with fixed or variable price provisions. In accordance with GAAP, these obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts shown do not, however, reflect open purchase orders, mainly for merchandise, to be fulfilled within one year, which are generally cancellable. 68 Table of Contents (d) Other long-term obligations, including current portion, principally represent obligations under insurance and self-insurance programs. These obligations are included in accrued liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. (e) The table above does not include $2.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the realization and timing of the related future cash flows, if any. Our assumptions with respect to the interest rates applicable to borrowings under the ABL facility, if any, are subject to changes that may be material. Interest obligations under the ABL facility are based on variable interest rates. We have made no attempt to project those rates for purposes of the table above. In addition, other future events could cause actual payments to differ materially from these amounts. The majority of our operating leases are for Sally Beauty Supply and BSG stores (which typically are located in strip shopping centers) and for Sally Beauty Supply and BSG distribution centers. The use of operating leases allows us to expand our business to new locations without making significant up-front cash outlays for the purchase of land and buildings. Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements At September 30, 2014 and 2013, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases incurred in the ordinary course of business, as well as outstanding letters of credit related to inventory purchases and self-insurance programs. Such letters of credit totaled $22.0 million and $23.9 million, respectively. Inflation We believe inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations during each of the last three fiscal years. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. We consider accounting policies to be critical when they require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and when different estimates that our management reasonably could have used have a material effect on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Our critical accounting estimates include but are not limited to the valuation of inventory, vendor rebates and concessions, retention of risk, income taxes, assessment of long-lived assets and intangible assets for impairment and share-based payments. Valuation of Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost, determined using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, or market (net realizable value). When necessary, the Company adjusts the carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or market, including disposal costs, and for estimated inventory shrinkage. Estimates of the future demand for the Company's products, historical turn-over rates, the age and sales history of the inventory, and historic as well as anticipated changes in stock keeping units ("SKUs") are some of the key factors used by management in assessing the net realizable value of inventory. We estimate inventory shrinkage between physical counts based upon our historical experience. Actual results differing from these estimates could significantly affect our inventory and cost of products sold and distribution expenses. Inventory shrinkage expense averaged approximately 1.0% of consolidated net sales in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012. A 10% increase or decrease in our estimate of inventory shrinkage at September 30, 2014, would impact net earnings by approximately $1.6 million, net of income tax. 69 Table of Contents Vendor Rebates and Concessions The Company deems a cash consideration received from a supplier to be a reduction of the cost of products sold unless it is in exchange for an asset or service or a reimbursement of a specific, incremental, identifiable cost incurred by the Company in selling the vendor's products. The majority of cash consideration received by the Company is considered to be a reduction of the cost of the related products and is reflected in cost of products sold and distribution expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings as the related products are sold. Any portion of such cash consideration received that is attributable to inventory on hand is reflected as a reduction of inventory. We consider the facts and circumstances of the various contractual agreements with vendors in order to determine the appropriate classification of amounts received in the consolidated statements of earnings. We record cash consideration expected to be received from vendors in other receivables at the amount we believe will be collected. These receivables could be significantly affected if the actual amounts subsequently collected differ from management's expectations. A 10% increase or decrease in these receivables at September 30, 2014, would impact net earnings by approximately $2.5 million, net of income tax. Retention of Risk Employee Health Insurance Liability We maintain a largely self-funded program, primarily in the U.S., for healthcare benefits for employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. We cover the majority of expenses associated with these benefits, other than certain fees and out-of pocket expenses paid by the employees through payroll deductions. Payments for healthcare benefits below specified amounts (currently $350,000 per individual per year) are self-insured by us. We base our estimate of ultimate liability on trends in claim payment history, historical trends in claims incurred but not yet reported, and other components such as expected increases in medical costs, projected premium costs and the number of plan participants. We review our liability on a regular basis and adjust our accruals accordingly. As of September 30, 2014 and 2013, we accrued an estimated liability relating to employee health insurance of $7.0 million and $5.7 million, respectively. Changes in facts and circumstances may lead to a change in the estimated liability due to revisions of the estimated ultimate costs of our employee healthcare benefits. Estimates of medical costs and trends in claims are some of the key factors used by our management in determining our employee health insurance liability. This liability could be significantly affected if actual results differ from management's expectations. A 10% increase or decrease in our employee health insurance liability at September 30, 2014 would impact net earnings by approximately $0.4 million, net of income tax. Workers' Compensation Liability, General Liability, and Automobile and Property Liability We maintain a large deductible insurance plan for workers' compensation liability, general liability and automobile and property liability loss exposures. We base our estimates of the ultimate liability on an actuarial analysis performed by an independent third-party actuary. We review our liability on a regular basis and adjust our accruals accordingly. As of September 30, 2014 and 2013, our balance sheet included an estimated liability related to these deductible and retention limits of approximately $31.4 million and $30.6 million, respectively. Changes in facts and circumstances may lead to a change in the estimated liability due to revisions of the estimated ultimate costs that affect our workers' compensation, general liability, and automobile and property liability insurance coverage. Changes in estimates occur over time due to such factors as claims incidence and severity of injury or damages. Our liabilities could be significantly affected if actual results differ from management's expectations or actuarial analyses. A 10% increase or decrease in our workers' compensation liability, general liability, and automobile and property liability at September 30, 2014 would impact net earnings by approximately $2.0 million, net of income tax. 70 Table of Contents The change in the insurance and self-insurance liability was as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2014 2013 Balance at beginning of period $ 37,266 $ 34,945 Self-insurance expense 76,841 68,111 Payments, net of employee contributions (75,004 ) (65,790 ) Balance at end of period $ 39,103 $ 37,266 Income Taxes We record income tax provisions in our consolidated financial statements based on an estimation of current income tax liabilities. The development of these provisions requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing. If we prevail in tax matters for which provisions have been established or are required to settle matters in excess of established provisions, our effective tax rate for a particular period could be significantly affected. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the effective income tax rates were 37.0%, 36.7% and 35.4%, respectively. The lower fiscal year 2012 annual effective tax rate, compared to our average historical effective tax rate of approximately 37.0%, was primarily due to tax benefits (approximately $10.3 million) resulting from a limited restructuring, for U.S. income tax purposes, completed in the fiscal year 2012. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are estimated to be recovered or settled. We believe that it is more likely than not that our results of operations in the future will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance currently recorded. We have recorded a valuation allowance to account for uncertainties regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, primarily foreign loss carryforwards. In the future, if we determine that certain deferred tax assets will not be realizable, the related adjustments could significantly affect our effective tax rate at that time. The estimated tax benefit of an uncertain tax position is recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax position will withstand challenge, if any, from applicable taxing authorities. Assessment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets for Impairment Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, including store equipment, and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. The recoverability of long-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization is assessed by comparing the net carrying amount of each asset to its total estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum of its undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, they are reviewed for impairment at least annually, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the value of the asset may be impaired. When assessing goodwill and intangible 71 Table of Contents assets with indefinite lives for potential impairment, management compares the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. In addition, management considers whether the value of an asset has been impaired by evaluating if various factors (including current operating results, anticipated future results and cash flows, and relevant market and economic conditions) indicate a possible impairment. The Company has adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment and ASU No. 2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment . These amendments allow an entity to first assess relevant qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment tests otherwise required under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ("ASC 350"). Based on the reviews performed by the Company, after taking into account the economic downturn experienced during the past several years in certain geographic areas in which it operates, there were no material asset impairments recognized in the current or prior fiscal years presented. Share-Based Payments We recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or to the date a participant becomes eligible for retirement, if earlier. For fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, total compensation cost charged against income and included in selling, general and administrative expenses for share-based compensation arrangements was $22.1 million, $19.2 million and $16.9 million, respectively. The amount of stock option expense is determined based on the fair value of each stock option grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected life, volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The expected life of stock options represents the period of time that the stock options granted are expected to be outstanding. We estimate the expected life based on historical employee tenure and option exercise trends. The expected volatility used for awards made during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, reflects the average historical volatility for the Company's common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the five-year zero-coupon U.S. Treasury issue at the date of the grant for the expected life of the stock options. The dividend yield represents our anticipated cash dividend over the expected life of the stock options. The amount of stock option expense recorded is significantly affected by these estimates. In addition, we record periodic stock option expense based on an estimate of the total number of stock options expected to vest, which requires us to estimate future forfeitures. We use our historical forfeiture experience as a basis for this estimate. Actual forfeitures could differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the amount and timing of the recognition of stock option expense. We have based all these estimates on our assumptions as of September 30, 2014. Our estimates for future periods may be based on different assumptions and, accordingly, may differ. We believe that our share-based compensation expense is based on reasonable estimates and assumptions. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimate or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in share-based compensation expense that could be material. A 10% change in our share-based compensation expense for the year ended September 30, 2014 would affect earnings by approximately $1.4 million, net of income tax. Recent Accounting Pronouncements We have not yet adopted and are currently assessing the potential effect of the following pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements: In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASU 2014-09") which will supersede Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605, Revenue Recognition . A core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should measure revenue in connection with its sale of goods and services to a customer based on an amount that depicts the 72 Table of Contents consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for each of those goods and services. For a contract that involves more than one performance obligation, the entity must (a) determine or, if necessary, estimate the standalone selling price at inception of the contract for the distinct goods or services underlying each performance obligation and (b) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative standalone selling prices. In addition, under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue when (or as) it satisfies each performance obligation under the contract by transferring the promised good or service to the customer. A good or service is deemed transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. The new standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. For public companies, this amendment is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is not permitted for public companies. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor determined the effect of the new standard on its financial statements.
