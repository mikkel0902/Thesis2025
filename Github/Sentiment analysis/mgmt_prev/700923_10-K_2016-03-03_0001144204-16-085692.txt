Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussions should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this report, including the Financial Statements and related notes contained in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements. Overview Introduction We are a leading specialty contractor serving the electrical infrastructure market. We manage and report our operations through two industry segments: T&D and C&I. We have operated in the T&D industry since 1891. We are one of the largest contractors servicing the T&D sector of the electric utility industry in the United States, and our customers include many of the leading companies in the industry. We have provided C&I electrical contracting services to facility owners and general contractors in the western United States since 1912. On April 13, 2015, we acquired substantially all the assets of ESB, which enhanced our T&D presence in the northeast U.S. and expanded our C&I presence outside of our existing markets. On November 24, 2015 we acquired all of the common stock of HCL, which added to our T&D capacity, predominantly in the western United States. In the second quarter of 2015 we were awarded our first project in Canada and have commenced work on this project in Manitoba as well as on several smaller projects in Canada. We believe that we have a number of competitive advantages in both of our segments, including our skilled workforce, extensive centralized fleet, proven safety performance and reputation for timely completion of quality work that allow us to compete favorably in our markets. In addition, we believe that we are better capitalized than some of our competitors, which provides us with valuable flexibility to take on additional and complex projects. We had revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2015, of $1.062 billion compared to $944.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our net income was $27.3 million compared to $36.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. While benefiting from increased spending by our customers in 2015, our project mix shifted away from large, multi-year transmission projects and included more shorter-duration projects. Shorter duration jobs often negatively affect gross margin and net income due to fleet utilization issues, labor productivity and mobilization and demobilization costs. In addition, increased competition in many of our markets resulted in lower bid margins, causing lower gross margins on those projects. The year ended December 31, 2014 benefited from unusually high gross margins that were primarily the result of favorable closeouts on several large, multi-year transmission projects, including several large claims or change orders. Overview Segments Transmission and Distribution segment. Our T&D segment provides comprehensive solutions to customers in the electric utility industry and the renewable energy industry. Our T&D segment generally serves the electric utility industry as a prime contractor to customers such as investor-owned utilities, cooperatives, private developers, government-funded utilities, independent power producers, independent transmission companies, industrial facility owners and other contractors. Our T&D segment provides a broad range of services on electric transmission and distribution networks and substation facilities which include design, engineering, procurement, construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services with a particular focus on construction, maintenance and repair. The demand for transmission construction and maintenance services increased over the past several years due to the modernization of the existing electric utility infrastructure and the need to integrate renewable generation into the electric power grid. 30 TABLE OF CONTENTS For the year ended December 31, 2015, our T&D revenues were $794.9 million or 74.9% of our revenue, compared to $699.6 million or 74.1% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $722.4 million or 80.0% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013. Revenues from transmission projects represented 73.9%, 77.8% and 84.8% of T&D segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our T&D segment also provides storm restoration services in response to hurricanes, ice or other storm related events, which typically account for less than 5% of our annual revenues. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized revenues from storm restoration services of approximately $7.7 million, $13.3 million and $14.6 million, respectively, which represented approximately 0.7%, 1.4% and 1.6% of our annual revenues, respectively. Measured by revenues in our T&D segment, we provided 48.4%, 53.1% and 55.4% of our T&D services under fixed-price contracts during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We also provide many services to our customers under multi-year maintenance service agreements and other variable service agreements. Commercial and Industrial segment. Our C&I segment provides services such as the design, installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring, installation of traffic networks and the installation of bridge, roadway and tunnel lighting. In our C&I segment, we generally provide our electric construction and maintenance services as a subcontractor to general contractors in the C&I industry as well as to facility owners. Our C&I operations are primarily in the western and northeastern United States where we have sufficient scale to deploy the level of resources necessary to achieve significant market share. We concentrate our efforts on projects where our technical and project management expertise are critical to successful and timely execution. The majority of C&I contracts cover electrical contracting services for airports, hospitals, data centers, hotels, stadiums, convention centers, manufacturing plants, processing facilities, waste-water treatment facilities, mining facilities and transportation control and management systems. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our C&I revenues were $266.8 million or 25.1% of our revenue, compared to $244.4 million or 25.9% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $180.3 million or 20.0% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013. Measured by revenues in our C&I segment, we provided 71.6%, 41.7% and 45.9% of our services under fixed-price contracts for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Overview Revenue and Gross Margins Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue on a percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which is commonly used in the construction industry. The percentage-of-completion accounting method results in recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs (excluding uninstalled direct materials). The profits or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability. Contract losses are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability. Changes in job performance, labor costs, equipment costs, job conditions, weather, estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. We record adjustments to estimated costs of contracts when we believe the change in estimate is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. These adjustments could result in either increases or decreases in profit margins. The gross margins we record in the current period may not be indicative of margins in future periods. Gross Margins. Our gross margin can vary between periods as a result of many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include: the mix of revenue derived from the industries we serve, the size and duration of our projects, the mix of business conducted in different parts of the country, the mix in service and maintenance work compared to new construction work, the amount of work that we subcontract, the amount of material we supply, changes in labor, equipment or insurance costs, seasonal weather patterns, changes in fleet utilization, pricing pressures due to competition, efficiency of work performance, fluctuations in commodity prices of materials, delays in the timing of projects and other factors. 31 TABLE OF CONTENTS Overview Economic, Industry and Market Factors We operate in competitive markets, which can result in pricing pressures for the services we provide. Work is often awarded through a bidding and selection process, where price is always a principal factor. We generally focus on managing our profitability by: selecting projects that we believe will provide attractive margins; actively monitoring the costs of completing our projects; holding customers accountable for costs related to changes to contract specifications; and rewarding our employees for controlling costs. The demand for construction and maintenance services from our customers has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the markets we serve as well as the economy in general. The financial condition of our customers and their access to capital, variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular period, and regional and national economic conditions may materially affect results. Project schedules, particularly in connection with larger, multi-year projects, can also create fluctuations in our revenues. Other market and industry factors, such as changes to our customers capital spending plans or delays in regulatory approvals can affect project schedules. Changes in technology, tax and other incentives and new or changing regulatory requirements affecting the industries we serve can impact demand for our services. While we actively monitor economic, industry and market factors affecting our business, we cannot predict the impact such factors may have on our future results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. As a result of economic, industry and market factors, our operating results in any particular period or year may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other period or for any other year. Overview Seasonality Although our revenues are primarily driven by spending patterns in our customers industries, our revenues, particularly those derived from our T&D segment, and results of operations can be subject to seasonal variations. These variations are influenced by weather, daylight hours, availability of system outages from utilities, and holidays. During the winter months, demand for our T&D work may be high, but our work can be delayed due to inclement weather. During the summer months, the demand for our T&D work may be affected by fewer available system outages during which we can perform electrical line service work due to peak electrical demands caused by warmer weather conditions. During the spring and fall months, the demand for our T&D work may increase due to improved weather conditions and system availability; however, extended periods of rain and other severe weather can affect the deployment of our crews and efficiency of operations. We also provide storm restoration services to our T&D customers. These services tend to have a higher profit margin. However, storm restoration service work that is performed under an MSA typically has similar rates to other work under the agreement. In addition, deploying employees on storm restoration work may, at times, delay work on other transmission and distribution work. Storm restoration service work is unpredictable and can affect results of operations. Outlook In the last few years we benefited from increased activity and spending in the electrical transmission markets we serve. We continue to expect long-term growth in the transmission market, although the timing of large bids and subsequent construction is likely to be highly variable from year to year. We believe several multi-year transmission projects will be available for bid in the 2016 to 2017 timeframe. We also expect bidding activity in small- to medium-sized transmission and distribution projects to continue in 2016 In 2015, we expanded our T&D presence organically through establishing new or additional operating locations in California, Kansas, Texas and Canada; and with the acquisitions of ESB and HCL. We also started work on our first project in Canada. In 2015, we expanded our C&I presence into the northeast with the acquisition of ESB, further increased our C&I business through organic growth in our existing markets and expanded geographically into Oregon, Minnesota and Washington. We believe that legislative and regulatory actions, state renewable portfolio standards, the aging of the electric grid, and the general improvement of the economy will positively impact the level of spending by our customers. Although competition remains strong, we see these trends as positive factors for us in the future. 32 TABLE OF CONTENTS Our business is directly impacted by the level of spending on T&D infrastructure across the U.S. and Canada and the level of commercial and industrial electrical construction activity in the markets we serve. The electric grid is aging and requires significant upgrades and maintenance to meet current and future demands for electricity. In addition, regulatory pressures and low energy prices may accelerate the shut-down of coal-fired generating plants, which could result in the need for line upgrades and new substations. Over the past several years, many utilities have begun to implement plans to improve their transmission systems, improve reliability and reduce congestion. These utilities have started or planned new construction, line upgrades and maintenance projects on many transmission systems. We believe that our customers remain committed to the expansion and strengthening of their transmission infrastructure, with planning, engineering and funding for many of their projects already in place. We believe we will continue to see significant bidding activity on large transmission projects in 2016 and 2017. The timing of multi-year transmission project awards and substantial construction activity is difficult to predict due to regulatory requirements and right-of-way permits needed to commence construction. Significant construction on any large, multi-year projects awarded in 2016 will not likely occur until 2017. Bidding and construction activity for small to medium-size transmission projects and upgrades remains strong, and we expect this trend to continue in 2016, primarily due to reliability and economic drivers. Competition in the transmission market continues to make winning projects difficult and has increased pressure on contract margins. We continue to see opportunities in the Canadian transmission market which we expect will extend over the next several years driven by load center delivery requirements, aging infrastructure, additional hydropower generation development and hydropower interconnection projects to serve Canadian load and the import of hydro power to the U.S. In 2015, our efforts to expand our service offerings within Canada resulted in the award of a large switchyard related to the Bipole III initiative in Manitoba, and we are evaluating several near- and long-term Canadian projects and opportunities that we believe would fit our portfolio of work. Legislative or regulatory actions may affect demand for the services provided by our T&D segment in the long term, particularly in connection with electric power infrastructure. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order No. 1000 promotes more efficient and cost-effective development of new transmission facilities, which we believe could have a long-term positive impact on electric transmission line development. We also anticipate increased infrastructure spending over the long term as a result of legislation requiring the electric power industry to meet national and local reliability standards for its transmission and distribution systems and incentives to the industry to invest in and improve maintenance on its systems. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Mercury and Air Toxics Standards ( MATS ) may force retirement of some coal-fired and oil-fired generating plants in the U.S. This compliance planning and implementation could result in increased spending by the affected utilities to strengthen their transmission infrastructure to alleviate congestion and deliver new and existing power sources to their regions. We believe that renewable resources in the U.S. will be a driver for large transmission project activity. State renewable portfolio standards, which set required or voluntary standards for how much electricity is to be generated from renewable energy sources, as well as general environmental concerns, are driving the development of renewable energy projects. The economic feasibility of renewable energy projects, and therefore the attractiveness of investment in the projects, may depend on the availability of tax incentive programs or the ability of the projects to take advantage of such incentives. The late-2015 congressional approval of a five-year extension to the Production Tax Credit and Investment Tax Credit should help spur additional wind and solar development, and we believe we will benefit from an increase in these projects. As a result of reduced spending by U.S. utilities on their distribution systems for several years, we believe there is a growing need for sustained investment by utilities on their distribution systems to properly maintain or meet reliability requirements. In 2015 we saw increased bidding activity in some of our electric distribution markets, as economic conditions improved in those areas. We believe that a recovery in the U.S. economy, and in the housing market in particular, over the next few years could provide additional stimulus for spending by our customers on their distribution systems. In addition, we believe there will be a push to strengthen utility distribution systems against major storm-related damage. Several industry and market trends are also prompting customers in the electric utility industry to seek outsourcing partners rather 33 TABLE OF CONTENTS than performing projects internally. These trends include an aging electric utility workforce, increasing costs and labor issues. We believe electric utility employee retirements could increase with further economic recovery, which may result in an increase in outsourcing opportunities. We expect to see an incremental increase in distribution opportunities in the U.S. in 2016 and we believe these opportunities will continue to be bid in a competitive market. We saw increased activity in many of our C&I markets in 2015. Results in our C&I segment improved significantly over the prior year as economic conditions improved. We expect to see continued improvement in both bidding opportunities and margins in our C&I segment in 2016. We expect the long-term growth in our C&I segment to generally track the economic growth of the regions we serve and benefit to the extent economic conditions continue to improve in the markets we serve. In the event economic conditions in these regions continue to improve, we ecpect our operations will benefit. We continue to invest in developing key management and craft personnel in both our T&D and C&I markets and in procuring the specialty equipment and tooling needed to win and execute projects of all sizes and complexity. In 2015 and 2014, we invested in capital expenditures of approximately $46.6 million and $39.0 million, respectively. Most of our capital expenditures supported opportunities in our T&D business. We plan to continue to invest in additional equipment and tooling, substantially through cash flows from operations and cash on hand, with a focus on transmission and distribution but we expect our capital expenditures in 2016 will be reduced from our 2015 capital expenditures as we look to expand our fleet through alternative financing approaches such as leasing. For some years we have been entering into operating leases for some of our facility, vehicle and equipment needs. These leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for the use of facilities, vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them. We intend to increase our use of leasing arrangements in 2016, particularly for the acquisition of shorter-lived assets, but will continue to purchase specialty equipment, which provides us with valuable flexibility to take on additional and complex projects. Our investment strategy is based on our belief that spending in transmission and distribution projects will continue to remain strong over the next several years as electric utilities, cooperatives and municipalities make up for the lack of infrastructure spending in the past, combined with the overall need to integrate new generation into the electric power grid, and our belief that distribution demand will increase over the next several years. Our future growth may be organic or through strategic acquisitions or joint ventures that we expect will improve our competitive position within our existing markets or expand our geographic footprint. We ended 2015 in a strong financial position, which included cash and cash equivalents of $39.8 million and availability of $155.7 million under our credit facility. We believe that our financial and operational strengths will enable us to manage the current challenges and uncertainties in the markets we serve and give us the flexibility for further strategic investments. Understanding Backlog We define backlog as our estimated revenue on uncompleted contracts, including the amount of revenue on contracts for which work has not begun, less the revenue we have recognized under such contracts. Backlog may not accurately represent the revenues that we expect to realize during any particular period. Several factors, such as the timing of contract awards, the type and duration of contracts, and the mix of subcontractor and material costs in our projects, can impact our backlog at any point in time. Some of our revenue does not appear in our periodic backlog reporting because the award of the project, as well as the execution of the work, can all take place within the period. For many of our unit-price, time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts, we only include projected revenue for a three-month period in the calculation of backlog, although these types of contracts are generally awarded as part of MSAs that typically have a one-year to three-year duration from execution. Our backlog only includes projects that have a signed contract or an agreed upon work order to perform work on mutually accepted terms and conditions. Changes in backlog from period to period are primarily the result of fluctuations in the timing of awards and revenue recognition of contracts. 34 TABLE OF CONTENTS Understanding Gross Margins Our gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues. Gross profit is calculated by subtracting contract costs from revenue. Contract costs consist primarily of salaries, wages and benefits to employees, depreciation, fuel and other equipment expenses, equipment rentals, subcontracted services, insurance, facilities expenses, materials and parts and supplies. Various factors affect our gross margins on a quarterly or annual basis, including those listed below. Performance Risk. Margins may fluctuate because of the volume of work and the impacts of pricing and job productivity, which can be impacted both favorably and negatively by customer decisions and crew productivity, as well as other factors. When comparing a service contract between periods, factors affecting the gross margins associated with the revenues generated by the contract may include pricing under the contract, the volume of work performed under the contract, the mix of the type of work specifically being performed, the availability of labor resources at expected labor rates and the productivity of the crews performing the work. Productivity can be influenced by many factors including the experience level of the crew, whether the work is on an open or encumbered right of way, weather conditions, geographical conditions and effects of environmental restrictions or regulatory delays. Seasonal, Weather and Geographical. Seasonal patterns, primarily related to weather conditions and the availability of system outages, can have a significant impact on gross margins in a given period. It is typical during the winter months that parts of the country may experience snow or rainfall, which can affect our crews ability to work efficiently. Additionally, our T&D customers often cannot remove their T&D lines from service during the summer months, when consumer demand for electricity is at its peak, delaying the demand for our maintenance and repair services. In both cases, projects may be delayed or temporarily placed on hold. Conversely, in periods when weather remains dry and temperatures are moderate, more work can be done, sometimes with less cost, which would have a favorable impact on gross margins. The mix of business conducted in different parts of the country will also affect margins, as some parts of the country offer the opportunity for higher margins than others due to the geographic characteristics associated with the physical location where the work is being performed. Such characteristics include whether the project is performed in an urban versus a rural setting; in a mountainous area or in open terrain; or in normal soil conditions or rocky terrain. Site conditions, including unforeseen underground conditions, can also impact margins. Depreciation and Amortization. We include depreciation on equipment in contract costs. This is common practice in our industry, but can make comparability to other companies difficult. Over the last few years, we have spent a significant amount of capital on property, facilities and equipment, with the majority of such expenditures being used to purchase additional specialized equipment to enhance our fleet and to reduce our reliance on lease arrangements and short term equipment rentals. In 2016 we intend to redeploy our capital by purchasing less equipment and increasing the use of alternative financing approaches, such as leasing, to meet our capital needs. We believe the investment in specialized equipment helps to reduce our costs and improve our margins and provides us with valuable flexibility to take on additional and complex projects. However, in 2016 we intend to procure more of our shorter-lived equipment through leasing arrangements, which will decrease our depreciation expense. Revenue Mix. The mix of revenue derived from the industries we serve will impact gross margins. Changes in our customers spending patterns in each of the industries we serve can cause an imbalance in supply and demand and, therefore, affect margins and mix of revenue by industry served. Storm restoration services typically command higher profit margins than other maintenance services. Seasonal and weather factors, as noted above, can impact the timing at which customers perform maintenance and repairs, which can cause a shift in the revenue mix. Service and Maintenance Compared to New Construction. In general, new construction work has a higher gross margin than maintenance and repair work. New construction work is often obtained on a fixed-price basis, which carries a higher risk than other types of pricing arrangements because a contractor can bear the risk of increased expenses. As such, we generally bid fixed-price contracts with higher profit margins. We typically derive approximately 10% to 35% of our revenue from maintenance and repair work that is performed under pre-established or negotiated prices or cost-plus pricing arrangements which generally allow 35 TABLE OF CONTENTS us a set margin above our costs. Thus, the mix between new construction work, at fixed-price, and maintenance and repair work, at cost-plus, in a given period will impact gross margin in that period. Material and Subcontract Costs. Projects that include a greater amount of material or subcontractor costs can experience lower overall project gross margins as we typically add less mark up to material and subcontractor costs in our bids than what we would to our labor and equipment cost. In addition, successful completion of our contracts may depend on whether our subcontractors successfully fulfill their contractual obligations. If our subcontractors fail to satisfactorily perform their contractual obligations as a result of financial or other difficulties, we may be required to incur additional costs and provide additional services in order to make up such shortfalls. Cost of Material. On fixed-price contracts where we are required to provide materials, our overall gross margin may be affected if we experience increases in material quantity or higher commodity costs. Materials versus Labor. Projects that include a greater amount of material cost can experience lower overall project gross margins as we typically add less mark up to material cost in our bids than what we would to our labor and equipment cost. Insurance. Gross margins could be impacted by fluctuations in insurance accruals related to our deductibles in the period in which such adjustments are made. We carry insurance policies, which were subject to certain deductibles, for workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and other coverages. Losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Fleet Utilization, Estimation, and Bidding. We operate a centrally-managed fleet in an effort to achieve the highest equipment utilization. We also develop internal equipment rates which provide our business units with appropriate cost information to estimate bids for new projects. Availability of equipment for a particular contract is determined by our internal fleet ordering process which is designed to optimize the use of internal fleet assets and allocate equipment costs to individual contracts. We believe these processes allow us to utilize our equipment efficiently, which leads to improved gross margins. Our team of trained estimators helps us to determine potential costs and revenues and make informed decisions on whether to bid for a project and, if bid, the rates to use in estimating the costs for that bid. The ability to accurately estimate labor, equipment, subcontracting and material costs in connection with a new project may affect the gross margins achieved for the project. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation, related benefits and employee costs for management and administrative personnel, office rent and utilities, stock compensation, communications, professional fees, depreciation, marketing costs and bad debt expense. 36 TABLE OF CONTENTS Consolidated Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected statements of operations data and such data as a percentage of revenues for the years indicated: For the year ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2015 2014 2013 Contract revenues $ 1,061,681 100.0 % $ 943,967 100.0 % $ 902,729 100.0 % Contract costs 939,340 88.5 811,553 86.0 777,852 86.2 Gross profit 122,341 11.5 132,414 14.0 124,877 13.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 79,186 7.5 73,818 7.8 69,818 7.7 Amortization of intangible assets 571 334 335 Gain on sale of property and equipment (2,257 ) (0.2 ) (142 ) (893 ) (0.1 ) Income from operations 44,841 4.2 58,404 6.2 55,617 6.2 Other income (expense) Interest income 25 106 9 Interest expense (741 ) (722 ) (0.1 ) (727 ) (0.1 ) Other, net 174 162 (27 ) Income before provision for income taxes 44,299 4.2 57,950 6.1 54,872 6.1 Income tax expense 16,997 1.6 21,406 2.2 20,113 2.2 Net income $ 27,302 2.6 % $ 36,544 3.9 % $ 34,759 3.9 % Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Revenues. Revenues increased $117.7 million, or 12.5%, to $1.062 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $944.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher T&D revenues and the acquisition of ESB. We benefited from increased spending by our customers and organic growth from new geographic markets, however, our project mix of shorter-duration projects increased while the number of large, multi-year transmission projects declined. Gross margin. Gross margin decreased to 11.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 14.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gross margin in 2014 benefited from favorable closeouts on several large, multi-year transmission projects. The remaining year-over-year decline in gross margin was primarily due to lower bid margins caused by increased competition in many of our markets and an increase in the number of shorter duration projects (which affects fleet utilization, labor productivity and mobilization and demobilization costs). Additionally, some of our jobs underperformed in 2015 due to labor productivity below previous estimates as a result of excessive labor turnover, rework on certain jobs and severe weather conditions in some of our markets. Changes in estimates of gross profit on certain projects resulted in gross margin increases of 0.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Changes in estimates of gross profit on certain projects, including several large claims or change orders, resulted in gross margin increases of 1.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gross profit. Gross profit decreased $10.1 million, or 7.6%, to $122.3 million for year ended December 31, 2015 from $132.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to lower gross margin partially offset by higher revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses, which were $79.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased $5.4 million from $73.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to higher personnel 37 TABLE OF CONTENTS and overhead costs to support our organic and acquisitive geographic market expansion, the impact of reversing a $2.3 million legal reserve in the fourth quarter in 2014, $1.4 million related to an executive officer transition and costs associated with the ESB and HCL acquisitions, partially offset by lower bonus and profit sharing costs. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 7.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 7.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gain on sale of property and equipment. Gains from the sale of property and equipment in the year ended December 31, 2015 were $2.3 million compared to $0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Gains from the sale of property and equipment are attributable to routine sales of property and equipment no longer useful or valuable to our ongoing operations. Interest expense. Interest expense was $0.7 million for both of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Income tax expense. The provision for income taxes was $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, with an effective tax rate of 38.4%, compared to a provision of $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, with an effective tax rate of 36.9%. The increase in the effective rate was primarily caused by changes in the mix of business between states and the impact of the foreign tax differential. Net income. Net income decreased to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $36.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily for the reasons stated above. Segment Results The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, statements of operations data by segment, segment net sales as a percentage of total net sales and segment operating income as a percentage of segment net sales: For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 (dollars in thousands) Amount Percent Amount Percent Contract revenues: Transmission & Distribution $ 794,898 74.9 % $ 699,595 74.1 % Commercial & Industrial 266,783 25.1 244,372 25.9 Total $ 1,061,681 100.0 $ 943,967 100.0 Operating income (loss): Transmission & Distribution $ 63,155 7.9 $ 75,439 10.8 Commercial & Industrial 13,592 5.1 16,542 6.8 Total 76,747 7.2 91,981 9.7 Corporate (31,906 ) (3.0 ) (33,577 ) (3.5 ) Consolidated $ 44,841 4.2 % $ 58,404 6.2 % Transmission & Distribution Revenues for our T&D segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $794.9 million compared to $699.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $95.3 million or 13.6%. While we benefited from increased spending by our customers, our project mix shifted away from large, multi-year transmission projects and included more shorter-duration projects. Revenues from transmission projects represented 73.9% and 77.8% of T&D segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2015, measured by revenue in our T&D segment, we provided 48.4% of our T&D services under fixed-price contracts, as compared to 53.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income for our T&D segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $63.1 million compared to $75.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income in 2014 benefited from large, multi-year transmission projects. The remaining year-over-year decline in operating income was primarily due to lower bid margins caused by increased competition in many of our markets and an increase 38 TABLE OF CONTENTS in the number of shorter duration projects (which affects fleet utilization, labor productivity and mobilization and demobilization costs). Additionally, some of our jobs underperformed in 2015 due to labor productivity below previous estimates, incremental costs associated with expansion into new geographic markets and severe weather conditions in some of our markets, partially offset by higher revenues. Operating income, as a percentage of revenues, for our T&D segment decreased to 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 10.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Commercial & Industrial Revenues for our C&I segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $266.8 million compared to $244.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $22.4 million or 9.2%, due primarily to the acquisition of ESB. For the year ended December 31, 2015, measured by revenue in our C&I segment, we provided 71.6% of our services under fixed-price contracts, as compared to 41.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income for our C&I segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $13.6 million compared to $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 17.6%. The year-over-year decline in operating income compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to lower bid margins caused by increased competition in many of our markets and certain underperforming jobs due to labor productivity below previous estimates as a result of excessive labor turnover and rework and incremental costs associated with expansion into new geographic markets, partially offset by higher revenues. As a percentage of revenues, operating income for our C&I segment decreased to 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Corporate The decrease in corporate expenses in 2015 was primarily attributable to lower bonus and profit sharing costs. Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Revenues. Revenues increased $41.3 million, or 4.6%, to $944.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $902.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 due to higher C&I revenues, partially offset by lower transmission revenues. Material and subcontractor cost comprised approximately 33% of total contract cost in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to approximately 31% in the year ended December 31, 2013. Gross profit. Gross profit increased $7.5 million, or 6.0%, to $132.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $124.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Gross margin increased to 14.0% in the year ended December 31, 2014 from 13.8% in the year ended December 31, 2013. Gross margins in 2014 and 2013 included net benefits of approximately 1.9% and 0.8%, respectively, from improved contract margins on several transmission projects due to change orders, resolution of claims, cost efficiencies, additional work and effective contract management. The gross margin benefit in 2014 was partially offset by lower equipment utilization, particularly large specialty transmission equipment as several large transmission projects were nearing completion, and higher equipment repair and maintenance costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $4.0 million, or 5.7%, to $73.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $69.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation and fringe benefits related to the increased number of personnel assigned to support operations and higher profit sharing and stock compensation costs. In the third quarter of 2013, we recorded a $2.3 million legal reserve which represented estimated punitive damages, interest and cost of an appeal bond pertaining to an adverse judgment involving a traffic accident in Florida. On February 27, 2015, a Florida appeals court unanimously reversed this judgment, determined that punitive damages were not available and remanded the case for a new trial. As a result, the $2.3 million legal reserve was reversed in the fourth quarter of 2014. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 7.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Gain on sale of property and equipment. Gains from the sale of property and equipment decreased $0.8 million to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.9 million for the year ended 39 TABLE OF CONTENTS December 31, 2013. Gains from the sale of property and equipment are the result of routine sales of property and equipment that are no longer useful or valuable to our ongoing operations. Interest expense. Interest expense was $0.7 million for both the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Income tax expense. The provision for income taxes was $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, with an effective tax rate of 36.9%, compared to a provision of $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, with an effective tax rate of 36.7%. Net income. Net income in 2014 increased to $36.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 for the reasons stated above. Segment Results The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, statements of operations data by segment, segment net sales as a percentage of total net sales and segment operating income as a percentage of segment net sales: For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 (dollars in thousands) Amount Percent Amount Percent Contract revenues: Transmission & Distribution $ 699,595 74.1 % $ 722,387 80.0 % Commercial & Industrial 244,372 25.9 180,342 20.0 Total $ 943,967 100.0 $ 902,729 100.0 Operating income (loss): Transmission & Distribution $ 75,439 10.8 $ 81,413 11.3 Commercial & Industrial 16,542 6.8 10,423 5.8 Total 91,981 9.7 91,836 10.2 Corporate (33,577 ) (3.5 ) (36,219 ) (4.0 ) Consolidated $ 58,404 6.2 % $ 55,617 6.2 % Transmission & Distribution Revenues for our T&D segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $699.6 million compared to $722.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $22.8 million or 3.2%. The decline in revenue was primarily due to lower revenues on several large transmission projects that were substantially complete or nearing completion, which were partially offset by higher distribution revenues. Material and subcontractor costs in our T&D segment comprised approximately 28% of total contract costs in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to approximately 27% in the year ended December 31, 2013. Revenues from transmission projects represented 77.8% and 84.8% of T&D segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2014, measured by revenue in our T&D segment, we provided 53.1% of our T&D services under fixed-price contracts, as compared to 55.4% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating income for our T&D segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $75.4 million compared to $81.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to lower equipment utilization, particularly large specialty transmission equipment as several large transmission projects were nearing completion, as well as higher equipment repair and maintenance costs. The impact of lower equipment utilization was partially offset by improved contract margins on several transmission projects due to change orders, resolution of claims, cost efficiencies, additional work and effective contract management. Operating income, as a percentage of revenues, for our T&D segment decreased to 10.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 11.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013. 40 TABLE OF CONTENTS Commercial & Industrial Revenues for our C&I segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $244.4 million compared to $180.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $64.1 million or 35.5%. The increase in revenues was largely due to increased activity in most of our service offerings as well as improved market conditions in Colorado and Arizona. Material and subcontractor cost in our C&I segment comprised approximately 48% of total contract cost in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to approximately 44% in the year ended December 31, 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, measured by revenue in our C&I segment, we provided 41.7% of our services under fixed-price contracts, as compared to 45.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating income for our C&I segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $16.5 million compared to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $6.1 million, or 58.7%. As a percentage of revenues, operating income for our C&I segment increased to 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in operating income was primarily due to increased revenue compared to 2013 and improved efficiency on the jobs we performed in 2014. Corporate The decrease in corporate expenses in 2014 was primarily attributable to the reversal in the fourth quarter of 2014 of the $2.3 million legal reserve, which had been accrued in 2013. The year over year impact of the legal reserve was partially offset by increased employee compensation and fringe benefits related to the increased number of personnel assigned to support operations and higher profit sharing and stock compensation costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $39.8 million and working capital of $123.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, consolidated operating activities of our business resulted in net cash flow from operations of $43.0 million compared to $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $12.0 million decline in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the $9.2 decline in net income. Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our services, operating margins and the type of services we provide our customers. The changes in various working capital accounts (such as: accounts receivable, including retention; costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts; accounts payable; and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts) are due to both the volume and timing of work performed, the mix of the types of projects and customers and their varying billing requirements as well as settlements of payables and other obligations. In particular, the gross amount of accounts receivable, net, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts, and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts used cash of $21.3 million in 2015, net of acquired balances, compared to $3.2 million of cash used in 2014, a year-over-year decline in cash used of $18.1 million. Days sales outstanding (DSO) was 66.7 days as of December 31, 2015, as compared to 59.8 days at December 31, 2014. The increase of 6.9 days has an impact of approximately $20.3 million in increased working capital, unrelated to volume. This increase is primarily due to timing of collections on our accounts receivable for various projects due to resolution of change orders and project close outs as well as customer mix and size of projects. In addition, billings are impacted by new customer billing processes that require additional efforts to process invoices, as well as requirements under various contracts. DSO is calculated by using the sum of current accounts receivable, net of allowances, retention receivables plus costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts less billing in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts, divided by average revenues per day during the last quarter. Accounts payable, which provided $6.7 million in cash in 2015 compared to using $17.3 million in 2014, accounted for a $24.0 million year-over-year change in cash used as a result of an increase in revenue volume and the timing of material purchases and subcontractor payments on contracts. Additionally, year-over-year changes in self-insurance reserves and other liabilities contributed to the year-over-year decline in cash provided by operating activities. 41 TABLE OF CONTENTS During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we used net cash of $56.9 million and $38.7 million, respectively, in investing activities. The $56.9 million of cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of $46.6 million for capital expenditures and $13.1 million to acquire ESB and HCL, partially offset by $2.8 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we used net cash of $23.9 million and $15.1 million, respectively, in financing activities. The $23.9 million of cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of $27.6 million of cash used to purchase shares of our common stock, which was partially offset by proceeds from stock options and tax benefits related to our stock compensation programs. The $27.6 million of cash used to purchase shares of our common stock consisted of $26.1 million purchased under our Repurchase Program and $1.5 million to purchase shares surrendered by employees to satisfy employee tax obligations under our stock compensation program. On July 30, 2015, our Board of Directors approved an amended Repurchase Program, which increased the program from $25.0 million to $42.5 million and extended the term of the program through August 31, 2016. On December 10, 2015, our Board of Directors approved an amended Repurchase Program, which increased the program from $42.5 million to $67.5 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had $24.8 million of remaining availability to purchase shares under the Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has spent $42.7 million to repurchase 1,835,120 shares at an average repurchase price of $23.22 since the inception of this program. We anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, borrowing capacity under our credit facility, and future cash flow from operations will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our future operating needs, debt service requirements, share repurchases and planned capital expenditures. We expect our capital expenditures in 2016 will be lower than the last few years as we look to expand our fleet through an increased use of alternative financing approaches, such as leasing. For some years we have been using operating leases for some of our facility, vehicle and equipment needs. These leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for the use of facilities, vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them. We intend to increase our use of leasing arrangements in 2016, particularly for the acquisition of shorter-lived assets, but will continue to purchase specialty equipment, which provides us with valuable flexibility to take on additional and complex projects. Although we believe that we have adequate cash and availability under our credit facility to meet our liquidity needs, our involvement in any multi-year transmission projects or the acquisition of other companies may require additional capital, depending upon the size of the project or the acquisition and the financial terms of the underlying agreement. Share Repurchase Amendment On February 10, 2016 the Board approved amendments to our Repurchase Program to increase the capacity by $75.0 million, modify its provisions to accelerate the pace of share repurchases, and extend the term through April 30, 2017. The amendments increased the overall size of the Repurchase Program to $142.5 million. The Company intends to fund the repurchase program from cash on hand and through borrowings under its credit facility. Debt Instruments On December 21, 2011, we entered into a five-year syndicated credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ) for an initial facility of $175.0 million (the Facility ). The entire Facility is available for revolving loans and the issuance of letters of credit. We have an option to increase the commitments under the Facility or enter into incremental term loans, subject to certain conditions, by up to an additional $75.0 million upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. Up to $25.0 million of the Facility is available for swingline loans. Revolving loans under the Facility bear interest, at our option, at either (1) ABR, which is the greatest of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50% or adjusted LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus in each case an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 1.00%; or (2) adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.00%. The applicable margin is determined based on our leverage ratio (the Leverage Ratio ), defined under the Credit Agreement as consolidated total indebtedness divided by consolidated EBITDA as defined by the Credit Agreement ( Consolidated EBITDA ). Letters of credit issued 42 TABLE OF CONTENTS under the Facility are subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.00% to 2.00%, based on our Leverage Ratio and a fronting fee of 0.125%. Swingline loans will bear interest at the ABR Rate. We are required to pay a 0.2% commitment fee on the unused portion of the Facility. Subject to certain exceptions, the Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of all of our subsidiaries and by a pledge of all of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries also guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the Facility. The Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding under the Facility may be accelerated and may become or be declared immediately due and payable. Under the Credit Agreement, we are subject to certain financial covenants, a Leverage Ratio and an interest coverage ratio ( Interest Coverage Ratio ), defined under the Credit Agreement as Consolidated EBITDA divided by interest expense. The Credit Agreement also contains a number of covenants including limitations on asset sales, investments, indebtedness and liens. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no debt outstanding, $155.7 million available for borrowing under our Credit Agreement and approximately $19.3 million in irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Agreement at an interest rate of 1.125%. The Facility expires on December 21, 2016 and we anticipate that we will be able to renew the Facility before it expires, but we can give no assurance that we can do so on favorable terms, if at all. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As is common in our industry, we enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets. Our significant off-balance sheet transactions include liabilities associated with non-cancelable operating leases, letter of credit obligations and bond guarantees entered into in the normal course of business. We have not engaged in any off-balance sheet financing arrangements through special purpose entities. Leases We enter into non-cancelable operating leases for some of our facility, vehicle and equipment needs. These leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for the use of facilities, vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them. We may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term, in which case we are typically liable to the lessor for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease. At December 31, 2015, we had no leases with residual value guarantees. We typically have purchase options on the equipment underlying our long-term operating leases and many of our short-term rental arrangements. We exercise some of these purchase options when the need for equipment is on-going and the purchase option price is attractive. Purchase Commitments for Construction Equipment As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $2.2 million in outstanding purchase obligations for certain construction equipment to be paid, with most of the cash outlay scheduled to occur over the first three months of 2016. Letters of Credit Some of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf, such as to beneficiaries under our insurance programs. In addition, from time-to-time certain customers require us to post letters of credit to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts and to guarantee performance under our contracts. Such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution. The letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder claims that we have failed to perform specified actions in accordance with the terms of the letter of credit. If this were to occur, we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement, we may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. Currently, we do not believe that it is likely that any claims will be made under any letter of credit in the foreseeable future. 43 TABLE OF CONTENTS At December 31, 2015, we had $19.3 million in irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Agreement at an interest rate of 1.125%, including $17.5 million related to the Company payment obligation under its insurance programs and approximately $1.8 million related to contract performance obligations. Performance and Payment Bonds Many customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety. These bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs. Under our continuing indemnity and security agreement with the surety, with the consent of our lenders under the Credit Agreement, we have granted security interests in certain of our assets to collateralize our obligations to the surety. We may be required to post letters of credit or other collateral in favor of the surety or our customers. Posting letters of credit in favor of the surety or our customers reduces the borrowing availability under the Facility. To date, we have not been required to make any reimbursements to the surety for bond-related costs. We believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund significant claims under our surety arrangements in the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2015, an aggregate of approximately $912.0 million in original face amount of bonds issued by the surety were outstanding. Our estimated remaining cost to complete these bonded projects was approximately $87.0 million as of December 31, 2015. Indemnities From time to time, pursuant to our service arrangements, we indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide under those service arrangements. These indemnification obligations may subject us to indemnity claims, liabilities and related litigation. We are not aware of any material unrecorded liabilities for asserted claims in connection with these indemnification obligations. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2015, our future contractual obligations are as follows: (in thousands) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Other Operating lease obligations $ 4,567 $ 1,717 $ 1,977 $ 807 $ 66 $ Purchase obligations 2,164 2,164 Income tax contingencies 564 564 Total $ 7,295 $ 3,881 $ 1,977 $ 807 $ 66 $ 564 Excluded from the above table are our multi-employer pension plan contributions, which are determined annually, based on our union employee payrolls, and which cannot be determined for future periods in advance. The amount of income tax contingencies has been presented in the Other column in the table above due to the fact that the period of future payment cannot be reliably estimated. For further information, refer to Note 10 to the Financial Statements. Concentration of Credit Risk We grant trade credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, to our customers, which include high credit quality electric utilities, governmental entities, general contractors and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties. Consequently, we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors. However, we generally have certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. Under certain circumstances such as foreclosures or negotiated settlements, we may take title to the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of receivables. As of December 31, 2015, one customer individually exceeded 10.0% of accounts receivable with approximately 13.0% of the total accounts receivable amount (excluding the impact of allowance for doubtful accounts). As of December 31, 44 TABLE OF CONTENTS 2014, one customer individually exceeded 10.0% of accounts receivable with approximately 14.2% of the total accounts receivable amount (excluding the impact of allowance for doubtful accounts). Management believes the terms and conditions in its contracts, billing and collection policies are adequate to minimize the potential credit risk. Inflation Inflation did not have a significant effect on our results during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013. New Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. We believe the following accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Financial Statements: Revenue Recognition. Revenues under long-term contracts are accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the contract term based on either input (e.g., costs incurred under the cost-to-cost method) or output (e.g., units delivered under the units-of-delivery method), as appropriate under the circumstances. Revenues from our construction services are performed under fixed-price, time-and-equipment, time-and-materials, unit-price, and cost-plus fee contracts. For fixed-price contracts, we use the ratio of cost incurred to date on the contract (excluding uninstalled direct materials) to management estimate of the contract total cost, to determine the percentage of completion on each contract. This method is used as management considers expended costs to be the best available measure of progression of these contracts. Contract cost includes all direct costs on contracts, including labor and material, subcontractor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as supplies, fuel, tool repairs and depreciation. We recognize revenues from construction services with fees based on time-and-materials, unit prices, or cost-plus fee as the services are performed and amounts are earned. If contracts include contract incentive or bonus provisions, they are included in estimated contract revenues only when the achievement of such incentive or bonus is reasonably certain. Contract costs incurred to date and expected total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract. Changes in job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence management assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts and therefore, our profit recognition. These changes, which include contracts with estimated costs in excess of estimated revenues, are recognized in contract costs in the period in which the revisions are determined. At the point we anticipate a loss on a contract, we estimate the ultimate loss through completion and recognize that loss in the period in which the possible loss was identified. A change order is a modification to a contract that changes the provisions of the contract, typically resulting from changes in scope, specifications, design, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites, or period of completion of the work under the contract. A claim is an amount in excess of the agreed-upon contract price that the Company seeks to collect from its clients or others for client-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders that are either in dispute or are unapproved as to both scope and price, or other causes. Costs related to change orders and claims are 45 TABLE OF CONTENTS recognized when incurred. Revenue from a change order is included in total estimated contract revenue when it is probable that the change order will result in an addition to contract value and can be reliably estimated. Revenue from a claim is included in total estimated contract revenues, only to the extent that contract costs related to the claim have been incurred, when it is probable that the claim will result in an addition to contract value which can be reliably estimated. No profit is recognized on a claim until final settlement occurs. The accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project. Cost estimates for all of our significant projects use a detailed bottoms up approach and we believe our experience typically allows us to provide materially reliable estimates. There are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability. The most significant of these include, among others: the completeness and accuracy of the original bid; costs associated with scope changes, change orders or claims; costs of labor and/or materials; extended overhead due to owner, weather and other delays; subcontractor performance issues; changes in productivity expectations; site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid (to the extent contract remedies are unavailable); the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project; and a change in the availability and proximity of equipment and materials. The foregoing factors as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods. We provide warranties to customers on a basis customary to the industry; however, the warranty period does not typically exceed one year. Historically, warranty claims have not been material. Total revenues do not include sales tax as we consider ourselves a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes. Insurance. We carry insurance policies, which are subject to certain deductibles, for workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and other coverages. Our deductible for each line of coverage is up to $1.0 million, except for certain health benefit plans, which are subject to a $0.1 million deductible for qualified individuals. Losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. The insurance and claims accruals are based on known facts, actuarial estimates and historical trends. While recorded accruals are based on the ultimate liability, which includes amounts in excess of the deductible, a corresponding receivable for amounts in excess of the deductible is included in current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Stock-Based Compensation. We determine compensation expense for stock-based awards based on their estimated fair value at the grant date and recognize the related compensation expense over the vesting period or requisite service period, whichever is shorter. We use the straight-line attribution method to recognize compensation expense related to stock-based awards that have graded vesting and only service conditions. This method recognizes stock compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Stock-based compensation expense is adjusted for changes in estimated and actual forfeitures. We use historical data to estimate the forfeiture rate that we use; however, these estimates are subject to change and may impact the value that will ultimately be recognized as stock compensation expense. We recognize stock-based compensation expense related to performance awards based upon our determination of the potential achievement of the performance target at each reporting date, net of estimated forfeitures. 46 TABLE OF CONTENTS Impairment of Goodwill and Intangibles. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis at the beginning of the fourth quarter, or when circumstances change, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or the decision to sell a business, both of which would indicate that impairment may have occurred. We perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two-step goodwill impairment test. The qualitative assessment considers financial, industry, segment and macroeconomic factors. If the qualitative assessment indicates a potential for impairment, the two-step method is used to determine if impairment exists. The two-step method begins with a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the process involves a comparison of the implied fair value and carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit. The company also performs a qualitative assessment on intangible assets with indefinite lives. If the qualitative assessment indicates a potential for impairment, a quantitative impairment test would be performed to compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite lived assets exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded in the statement of operations. In 2015, we determined, based on our qualitative analysis, that it was appropriate to perform a two-step analysis. The first step involves a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the process involves a comparison of the implied fair value and carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recorded in the statement of operations. The step one analysis did not indicate that our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets were impaired. As a result, no step two analysis was performed. As a result of the annual qualitative review process in 2014 and 2013, we determined it was not necessary to perform a two-step analysis. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We do not generally charge interest to our customers, and we carry our customer receivables at their face amounts, less an allowance for doubtful accounts. Included in accounts receivable are balances billed to customers pursuant to retainage provisions in certain contracts that are due upon completion of the contracts and acceptance by the customer, or earlier, as provided by the contract. Based on our experience in recent years, the majority of customer balances at each balance sheet date are collected within twelve months. We grant trade credit, on a non-collateralized basis (with the exception of lien rights against the property in certain cases) to our customers, and we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and overall economic activity. We analyze specific accounts receivable balances, historical bad debts, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In the event that a customer balance is deemed to be uncollectible the account balance is written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts.
