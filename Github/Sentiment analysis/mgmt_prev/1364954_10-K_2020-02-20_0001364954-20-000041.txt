ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K . We have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years of financial condition and results of operations and this information can be found in Part I, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 , filed with the SEC on February 25, 2019 , which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at sec.gov and on our website at investor.chegg.com. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. See the section titled Note about Forward-Looking Statements for additional information. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K , particularly in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. Overview Chegg is a Smarter Way to Student. As the leading direct-to-student learning platform, we strive to improve educational outcomes by putting the student first in all our decisions. We support students on their journey from high school to college and into their career with tools designed to help them pass their test, pass their class, and save money on required materials. Our services are available online, anytime and anywhere, so we can reach students when they need us most. Students subscribe to our subscription services, which we collectively refer to as Chegg Services. Our primary Chegg Services include Chegg Study, Chegg Writing, Chegg Tutors, Chegg Math Solver, and Thinkful . Our Chegg Study subscription service provides Expert Answers and step-by-step Textbook Solutions, helping students with their course work. When students need help creating citations for their papers, they can use one of our Chegg Writing properties, including EasyBib, Citation Machine, BibMe, and CiteThisForMe . When students need additional help on a subject, they can reach a live tutor online, anytime, anywhere through Chegg Tutors. Our Chegg Math Solver subscription service helps students understand math by providing a step-by-step math solver and calculator. We offer Required Materials, which includes an extensive print textbook and eTextbook library for rent and sale, helping students save money compared to the cost of buying new. To deliver services to students, we partner with a variety of third parties. We source print textbooks, eTextbooks, and supplemental materials directly or indirectly from publishers in the United States, including Cengage Learning, Pearson, McGraw Hill, Sage Publications, and MacMillan. In October 2019, we acquired Thinkful, a skills-based learning platform that offers professional courses directly to students across the United States to expand our existing offerings by adding affordable and high-quality courses focused on the most in-demand technology skills. During the years ended December 31, 2019 , and 2018 , we generated net revenues of $410.9 million and $321.1 million , respectively, and in the same periods had net losses of $9.6 million and $14.9 million , respectively. We plan to continue to invest in our long-term growth, particularly further investment in the technology that powers our learning platform and the development of additional products and services that serve students. Our strategy for achieving profitability is centered upon our ability to utilize Chegg Services to increase student engagement with our learning platform. We plan to continue to invest in the expansion of our Chegg Services to provide a more compelling and personalized solution and deepen engagement with students. In addition, we believe that the investments we have made to achieve our current scale will allow us to drive increased operating margins over time that, together with increased contributions of Chegg Services, will enable us to accomplish profitability and become cash-flow positive in the long-term. Our ability to achieve these long-term objectives is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including our ability to attract, retain, and increasingly engage the student population, intense competition in our markets, the ability to achieve sufficient contributions to revenue from Chegg Services and other factors described in greater detail in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. We have presented revenues for our two product lines, Chegg Services and Required Materials, based on how students view us and the utilization of our products by them. More detail on our two product lines is discussed in the next two sections titled "Chegg Services" and "Required Materials." 40 Table of Contents Chegg Services Our Chegg Services for students primarily includes Chegg Study, Chegg Writing, Chegg Tutors, Chegg Math Solver, and Thinkful , our skills-based learning platform. Students typically pay to access Chegg Services such as Chegg Study on a monthly basis. We also work with leading brands to provide students with discounts, promotions, and other products that, based on student feedback, delight them. In the aggregate, Chegg Services revenues were 81% and 79% and of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Required Materials Our Required Materials product line includes a revenue share, upon fulfillment, on the total transactional amount of a rental and sale transaction for print textbooks . We have entered into agreements with partners to provide our customers a wide variety of print textbooks for which they have title and risk of loss. These agreements have allowed us to reduce capital requirements and operating expenses. Additionally, Required Materials includes revenues from eTextbooks , which we offer on a standalone basis or as a rental-equivalent solution and for free to students awaiting the arrival of their print textbook rental for select print textbooks. eTextbooks and supplemental course materials are available from approximately 120 publishers as of December 31, 2019 . In the aggregate, Required Materials revenues were 19% and 21% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. In October 2019, we signed a strategic logistics agreement with FedEx which will transition the logistics and warehousing for print textbooks transactions to FedEx in 2020. In January 2020, we began making purchases of print textbooks for our print textbook library, in which we will have title and risk of loss. Required Materials will also include revenues from print textbooks that we will own, which will be recognized as the total transaction amount ratably over the term of a rental period, which is generally two to five months. Seasonality of Our Business Chegg Services, rental revenues from print textbooks that we own, and eTextbooks revenues are primarily recognized ratably over the term a student subscribes to our Chegg Services or rents a print textbook or eTextbook. This has generally resulted in our highest revenues and profitability in the fourth quarter as it reflects more days of the academic year. Our variable expenses related to marketing activities remain highest in the first and third quarter such that our profitability may not provide meaningful insight on a sequential basis. As a result of these factors, the most concentrated periods for our revenues and expenses do not necessarily coincide, and comparisons of our historical quarterly results of operations on a sequential basis may not provide meaningful insight into our overall financial performance. Components of Results of Operations Net Revenues We recognize revenues from our Chegg Services and Required Materials product lines, net of allowances for refunds or charge backs from our payment processors who process payments from credit cards, debit cards, and PayPal. Revenues from our Chegg Services product line primarily includes Chegg Study, Chegg Writing, Chegg Tutors, Chegg Math Solver, and Thinkful . Chegg Services are offered to students primarily through weekly or monthly subscriptions, and we recognize revenues ratably over the respective subscription period. Revenues from Thinkful, our skills-based learning platform, are recognized either ratably over the term of the course, generally six months, or upon completion of the lessons, depending on the instruction type of the course. Revenues from our Required Materials product line includes a revenue share, upon fulfillment, on the total transactional amount of a rental and sale transaction for print textbooks and revenues from eTextbooks. The revenue share on the rental and sale of print textbooks is recognized immediately when a book ships to the student. Shipping and handling activities are performed after we recognize revenues and we have elected to account for them as activities to fulfill a print textbook rental or sale order. Revenues from the rental of eTextbooks is recognized ratably over the contractual period, generally two to five months. Revenues from the sale of eTextbooks is recognized immediately when the eTextbook sale occurs. Beginning in 2020, as a result of our ownership of print textbooks in conjunction with the transition to 41 Table of Contents FedEx for print textbook logistics and warehousing, Required Materials will also include revenues from print textbooks that we will own, which will be recognized as the total transaction amount ratably over the term of a rental period, which is generally two to five months. When deciding the most appropriate basis for presenting revenues or costs of revenues, both the legal form and substance of the agreement between us and our business partners are reviewed to determine each party respective role in the transaction. Where our role in a transaction is that of principal, revenues are recognized on a gross basis. This requires revenue to comprise the gross value of the transaction billed to the customer, after trade discounts, with any related expenditure charged as a cost of revenues. Where our role in a transaction is that of an agent, revenues are recognized on a net basis with revenues representing the margin earned. In relation to print textbook rental and sale agreements with our partners, we recognize revenues on a net basis based on our role in the transaction as an agent . Cost of Revenues Our cost of revenues consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products and services. Cost of revenues primarily consists of publisher content fees for eTextbooks, content amortization expense related to content that we develop, license from publishers for which we pay one-time license fees, or acquire through acquisitions, payment processing costs, the payments made to tutors through our Chegg Tutors service, personnel costs and other direct costs related to providing content or services. In addition, cost of revenues includes allocated information technology and facilities costs. Beginning in 2020, as a result of our ownership of print textbooks in conjunction with our transition to FedEx for print textbook logistics and warehousing, cost of revenues will additionally include, but not limited to, print textbook library depreciation and shipping and other fulfillment costs. Changes in our cost of revenues may be disproportionate to changes in our revenues because unrecoverable costs, such as outbound shipping and other fulfillment and payment processing fees, are expensed in the period they are incurred while our revenues may be recognized ratably over the subscription or rental term. This effect is particularly pronounced in the first and third quarters, corresponding to the beginning of academic terms. Operating Expenses We classify our operating expenses into four categories: research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and restructuring charges. One of the most significant components of our operating expenses is employee-related costs, which include share-based compensation expenses. We expect to continue to hire new employees in order to support our current and anticipated growth. In any particular period, the timing of additional hires could materially affect our operating expenses, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. Our operating expenses also contain information technology expenses such as technology costs to support our research and development, sales and marketing expenses, depreciation on our infrastructure systems, amortization of acquired intangible assets except content libraries, and outside services. We allocate certain costs to each expense category, including cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative. The allocation is primarily based on the headcount in each group at the end of a period. As our business grows, our operating expenses may increase over time to expand capacity and sustain our workforce. Research and Development Our research and development expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation expense for employees on our product, engineering, and technical teams who are responsible for maintaining our website, developing new products, and improving existing products. Research and development costs also include amortization of acquired intangible assets, depreciation expense, technology costs to support our research and development, outside services, and allocated information technology and facilities expenses. We expense substantially all of our research and development expenses as they are incurred. In the past three years, our research and development expenses have increased to support new products and services as well as to expand our infrastructure capabilities to support back-end processes associated with our revenue transactions and internal systems. We intend to continue making significant investments in developing new products and services and enhancing the functionality of existing products and services. 42 Table of Contents Sales and Marketing Our sales and marketing expenses consist of user and advertiser-facing marketing and promotional expenditures through a number of targeted online marketing channels, sponsored search, display advertising, email marketing campaigns, and other initiatives. We incur salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expenses for our employees engaged in marketing, business development and sales and sales support functions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and allocated information technology, and facilities costs. Our marketing expenses are largely variable; and we tend to incur these in the first and third quarters of the year due to our efforts to target students at the beginning of academic terms. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense. General and Administrative Our general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense for certain executives as well as our finance, legal, human resources and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include outside services, legal and accounting services, depreciation expense, and allocated information technology and facilities costs. Restructuring Charges Restructuring charges are primarily comprised of severance costs, contract and program termination costs, asset impairments and costs of facility consolidation and closure. Restructuring charges are recorded upon approval of a formal management plan and are included in the results of operations of the period in which such plan is approved and the expense becomes estimable. Interest Expense, Net and Other Income, Net Interest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense on the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs related to the notes. Other income, net consists primarily of interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes consists primarily of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Due to the uncertainty as to the realization of the benefits of our domestic deferred tax assets, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against such assets. We intend to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. 43 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table summarizes our historical consolidated statements of operations (in thousands, except percentage of total net revenues): Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Net revenues $ 410,926 100 % $ 321,084 100 % Cost of revenues (1) 92,182 22 79,996 25 Gross profit 318,744 78 241,088 75 Operating expenses: Research and development (1) 139,772 34 114,291 36 Sales and marketing (1) 63,569 15 54,714 17 General and administrative (1) 97,489 24 77,714 24 Restructuring charges 97 589 Total operating expenses 300,927 73 247,308 77 Income (loss) from operations 17,817 5 (6,220 ) (2 ) Total interest expense, net and other income, net (24,788 ) (6 ) (7,238 ) (2 ) Loss before provision for income taxes (6,971 ) (1 ) (13,458 ) (4 ) Provision for income taxes 2,634 (1 ) 1,430 (1 ) Net loss $ (9,605 ) (2 )% $ (14,888 ) (5 )% (1) Includes share-based compensation expense as follows: Cost of revenues $ 426 $ 420 Research and development 22,229 17,055 Sales and marketing 7,380 6,703 General and administrative 34,874 27,852 Total share-based compensation expense $ 64,909 $ 52,030 44 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 Net Revenues Net revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $89.8 million , or 28% , compared to the same period in 2018 . The following table sets forth our total net revenues for the periods shown for our Chegg Services and Required Materials product lines (in thousands, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Change in 2019 2019 2018 $ % Chegg Services $ 332,221 $ 253,985 $ 78,236 31 % Required Materials 78,705 67,099 11,606 17 Total net revenues $ 410,926 $ 321,084 $ 89,842 28 Chegg Services revenues increased by $78.2 million , or 31% , during the year ended December 31, 2019 , compared to the same period in 2018 due to growth in Chegg Study and Chegg Writing. Chegg Services revenues represented 81% and 79% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Required Materials revenues increased by $11.6 million , or 17% , during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 , primarily due to better performance from our Required Materials print textbook partners as well as recognition of deferred variable consideration. Required Materials revenues represented 19% and 21% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Beginning in 2020, Required Materials will also include revenues from print textbooks that we will own, which will be recognized as the total transaction amount ratably over the term of a rental period, which is generally two to five months. As such, we expect Required Materials revenues to increase in 2020. Cost of Revenues The following table sets forth our cost of revenues for the periods shown (in thousands, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Change in 2019 2019 2018 $ % Cost of revenues (1) $ 92,182 $ 79,996 $ 12,186 15 % (1) Includes share-based compensation expense of: $ 426 $ 420 $ 6 1 % Cost of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $12.2 million , compared to the same period in 2018 . The increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization of content of $7.1 million , higher payment processing of $2.2 million , and higher employee-related expenses of $1.8 million . Gross margins increased to 78% in the year ended December 31, 2019 , from 75% during the same period in 2018 as a result of the growth in our higher margin Chegg Services revenues. Beginning in 2020, we expect our cost of revenues to increase and gross margins to decrease as a result of costs related to our ownership of print textbooks. 45 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table sets forth our total operating expenses for the periods shown (in thousands, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Change in 2019 2019 2018 $ % Research and development (1) $ 139,772 $ 114,291 $ 25,481 22 % Sales and marketing (1) 63,569 54,714 8,855 16 General and administrative (1) 97,489 77,714 19,775 25 Restructuring charges 97 589 (492 ) (84 ) Total operating expenses $ 300,927 $ 247,308 $ 53,619 22 (1) Includes share-based compensation expense of: Research and development $ 22,229 $ 17,055 $ 5,174 30 % Sales and marketing 7,380 6,703 677 10 General and administrative 34,874 27,852 7,022 25 Share-based compensation expense $ 64,483 $ 51,610 $ 12,873 25 Research and Development Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $25.5 million , or 22% , compared to the same period in 2018 . The increase was primarily attributable to higher employee-related expenses of $12.6 million , higher technology costs to support our research and development of $5.0 million , higher share-based compensation expense of $5.2 million , higher employer taxes driven by the increases in our stock price of $1.0 million , higher depreciation and amortization of $1.1 million , and higher outside services of $2.3 million , compared to the same period in 2018 . Research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 34% during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 36% of net revenues during the same period in 2018 . Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $8.9 million , or 16% , compared to the same period in 2018 . The increase was attributable to higher paid marketing expense of $6.6 million primarily for streaming radio and display advertisement, higher employee-related expenses of $0.4 million , higher share-based compensation expense of $0.7 million , and higher employer taxes driven by the increase in our stock price of $0.3 million , compared to the same period in 2018 . Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 15% during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 17% of net revenues during the same period in 2018 . General and Administrative General and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $19.8 million , or 25% , compared to the same period in 2018 . The increase was primarily attributable to higher employee-related expenses of $6.0 million , higher share-based compensation expense of $7.0 million , higher employer taxes driven by the increases in our stock price of $1.6 million , higher depreciation and amortization of $1.0 million , higher professional fees of $1.4 million , higher outside services of $0.2 million and higher technology expenses to support our operations of $1.0 million , compared to the same period in 2018 . General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were flat at 24% during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Restructuring Charges Restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2019 were not material to our results of operations. Restructuring charges of $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 were primarily related to our subtenant filing for bankruptcy and exiting our leased office. Costs incurred to date are expected to be fully paid within two months . 46 Table of Contents Interest Expense, Net and Other Income, Net The following table sets forth our interest expense, net, and other income, net, for the periods shown (in thousands, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Change in 2019 2019 2018 $ % Interest expense, net $ (44,851 ) $ (11,225 ) $ (33,626 ) 300 % Other income, net 20,063 3,987 16,076 403 Total interest expense, net and other income, net $ (24,788 ) $ (7,238 ) $ (17,550 ) 242 Interest expense, net increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 , compared to the same period in 2018 , primarily attributable to the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and contractual interest expense related to the notes. Other income, net, increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 , compared to the same period in 2018 , primarily attributable to additional interest earned on our investments purchased with proceeds from the notes. Provision for Income Taxes The following table sets forth our provision for income taxes for the periods shown (in thousands, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Change in 2019 2019 2018 $ % Provision for income taxes $ 2,634 $ 1,430 $ 1,204 84 % We recorded an income tax provision of approximately $2.6 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, which was primarily due to state and foreign income tax expense. The provision for income taxes increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 , compared to the same period in 2018 , and was primarily due a decrease in prior year tax provision driven by the release of uncertain tax provisions. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2019 , our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaling $1.1 billion , which were held for working capital purposes. The substantial majority of our net revenues are from e-commerce transactions with students, which are settled immediately through payment processors, as opposed to our accounts payable, which are settled based on contractual payment terms with our suppliers. In March/April 2019 and April 2018, we closed offerings of our 2025 notes and our 2023 notes generating net proceeds of approximately $780.2 million and $335.6 million , respectively, in each case after deducting the initial purchasers discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The 2025 notes and 2023 notes mature on March 15, 2025 and May 15, 2023, respectively, unless converted, redeemed, or repurchased in accordance with their terms prior to such date. As of December 31, 2019 , we have incurred cumulative losses of $416.3 million from our operations and we expect to incur additional losses in the future. Our operations have been financed primarily by our initial public offering of our common stock (IPO), our 2017 follow-on public offering, our 2023 notes and 2025 notes offerings, and cash generated from operations. Beginning in 2020, we expect to purchase approximately $50.0 million of print textbooks, net of proceeds from liquidations of print textbooks, in conjunction with the transition of logistics and warehousing for print textbooks transactions to FedEx. Purchases of print textbooks will be shown as a cash outflow from investing activities and proceeds from liquidations of print textbooks will be shown as a cash inflow from investing activities. 47 Table of Contents We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, our investments in research and development activities, our acquisition of new products and services and our sales and marketing activities. To the extent that existing cash and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to adequately fund our business plans and it could have a negative effect on our business, operating cash flows and financial condition. Most of our cash is held in the United States. As of December 31, 2019 , our foreign subsidiaries held an insignificant amount of cash in foreign jurisdictions. We currently do not intend or foresee a need to repatriate some of these foreign funds, however, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we anticipate the U.S. federal impact to be minimal if these foreign funds are repatriated. In addition, based on our current and future needs, we believe our current funding and capital resources for our international operations are adequate. The following table sets forth our cash flows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 113,403 $ 75,113 Net cash used in investing activities $ (703,425 ) $ (82,549 ) Net cash provided by financing activities $ 603,509 $ 256,418 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Although we incurred net losses during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , our net losses were fully offset by non-cash expenditures such as other depreciation and amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs expense. Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $113.4 million . Our net loss of $9.6 million was offset by significant non-cash operating expenses, including other depreciation and amortization expense of $30.2 million , share-based compensation expense of $64.9 million , and the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs related to the 2025 notes and 2023 notes of $43.2 million . Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $75.1 million. Our net loss of $14.9 million was offset by significant non-cash operating expenses, including other depreciation and amortization expense of $22.8 million, share-based compensation expense of $52.0 million, and the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs related to the 2023 notes of $10.5 million. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities have been primarily related to the purchases of investments, acquisition of businesses, and purchases of property and equipment, offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments.

(2) Represents contractual obligations primarily related to information technology services. (3) Our offices are leased under operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2024 . (4) Represents one-time obligation to purchase print textbooks to establish our initial print textbook library. In addition, our other long-term liabilities include $2.1 million related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2019 . The timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond one year. As a result, this amount is not included in the above table. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through December 31, 2019 , we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that 49 Table of Contents assumptions and estimates of the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue For sales of third-party products, we evaluate whether we are acting as a principal or an agent, and therefore would record the gross sales amount as revenues and related costs or the net amount earned as a revenue share from the sale of third-party products. Our determination is based on our evaluation of whether we control the specified goods or services prior to transferring them to the customer. There are significant judgments involved in determining whether we control the specified goods or services prior to transferring them to the customer including whether we have the ability to direct the use of the good or service and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the good or service. In relation to print textbook rental and sale agreements with our partners, we recognize revenues on a net basis based on our role in the transaction as an agent as we have concluded that we do not control the use of the print textbooks, and therefore record only the revenue share we earn upon the shipment of a print textbook to a student. For the rental or sale of eTextbooks, we have concluded that we control the service, therefore we recognize revenues and cost of revenues on a gross basis ratably over the term the student has access to the eTextbook. Rental revenues from print textbooks that we own will be recognized at the gross amount of the total transaction as a principal as we have concluded that we do control the use of print textbooks that we own. Some of our customer arrangements include multiple performance obligations. We have determined these performance obligations qualify as distinct performance obligations, as the customer can benefit from the service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and our promise to transfer the service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. For these arrangements that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price based on the relative standalone selling price method by comparing the standalone selling price (SSP) of each distinct performance obligation to the total value of the contract. We determine the SSP based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the distinct performance obligation when sold separately. If the SSP is not directly observable, we estimate the SSP by considering information such as market conditions, and information about the customer. Our agreements with print textbook partners may include an amount of variable consideration in addition to a fixed revenue share that we earn. This variable consideration can either increase or decrease the total transaction price depending on the nature of the variable consideration. We estimate the amount of variable consideration that we will earn at the inception of the contract, adjusted during each period, and include an estimated amount each period. In determining this estimate, we consider the single most likely amount in a range of possible amounts. This estimated amount of variable consideration requires management to make a judgment based on the forecasted amount of consideration that we expect we will earn as well as the time period in which we can reasonably rely on the accuracy of the forecast. Our estimate of variable consideration is constrained to only include three to four years of estimated variable consideration. This is the amount of variable consideration for which it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur, as the amounts that we could potentially earn in the outer years can change significantly based on factors that are out of our control. If our forecasts are inaccurate, the estimated amount of variable consideration could be inaccurate which could impact our revenue recognition in a given period. Impairment of Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets We assess the impairment of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in determining when to perform an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends or significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. When measuring the recoverability of these assets, we will make assumptions regarding our estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If our estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to impair these assets. We did not record any impairment charges related to acquired intangible assets or other long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 . As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we had intangible assets, net, of $34.7 million and $25.9 million , respectively and property and equipment, net of $87.4 million and $59.9 million , respectively. 50 Table of Contents Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Asset Goodwill and our indefinite lived intangible asset are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. In our qualitative assessment, we consider factors including economic conditions, industry and market conditions and developments, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. Our qualitative assessment requires management to make judgments based on the factors listed above in our determination of whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. Should we conclude that it is more likely than not that our carrying values have been impaired, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill and our indefinite lived intangible asset exceed our fair value. We have not recognized any impairment of goodwill or our indefinite lived intangible asset since our inception. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we had goodwill of $214.5 million and $149.5 million , respectively, and an indefinite lived intangible asset related to the internships.com trade name of $3.6 million . Share-based Compensation Expense We measure and recognize share-based compensation expense for all awards made to employees, directors and consultants, including restricted stock units (RSUs), performance-based RSUs (PSUs) and our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) based on estimated fair values. We estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the share-based compensation expense related to our awards. Estimated forfeitures are determined based on historical data and management expectation of exercise behaviors. We continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover and other factors. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our share-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the share-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the share-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements. Share-based compensation expense recognized related to PSUs is subject to the achievement of performance objectives and requires significant judgment by management in determining the current level of attainment of such performance objectives. Management may consider factors such as the latest revenue forecasts and general business trends in the assessment of whether or not a PSU award will be obtained. Subsequent changes to these considerations may have a material impact on the amount of share-based compensation expense recognized in the period related to PSU awards, which may lead to volatility of share-based compensation expense period-to-period. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our share-based compensation expense on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates, which could materially impact our future share-based compensation expense.
