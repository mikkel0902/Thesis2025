ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Part I, including matters set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10-K, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Except to the extent that differences among operating segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole, we present the discussion in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on a consolidated basis. Overview AutoNation, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. As of December 31, 2013 , we owned and operated 269 new vehicle franchises from 228 stores located in the United States, predominantly in major metropolitan markets in the Sunbelt region. Our stores, which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets, sell 33 different new vehicle brands. The core brands of new vehicles that we sell, representing approximately 95% of the new vehicles that we sold in 2013 , are manufactured by Toyota, Ford, Honda, Nissan, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Chrysler, and Volkswagen . We offer a diversified range of automotive products and services, including new vehicles, used vehicles, parts and service, which includes automotive repair and maintenance services as well as wholesale parts and collision businesses, and automotive finance and insurance products, which include vehicle service and other protection products, as well as the arranging of financing for vehicle purchases through third-party finance sources. As of December 31, 2013 , we had three operating segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. Our Domestic segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. Our Import segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan. Our Premium Luxury segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Lexus. The franchises in each segment also sell used vehicles, parts and automotive repair and maintenance services, and automotive finance and insurance products. For the year ended December 31, 2013 , new vehicle sales accounted for approximately 57% of our total revenue, but approximately 22% of our total gross profit. Used vehicle sales accounted for approximately 24% of our total revenue, and approximately 12% of our total gross profit. Our parts and service and finance and insurance operations, while comprising approximately 19% of total revenue, contributed approximately 65% of our gross profit. Results of Operations We had net income from continuing operations of $375.8 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.05 in 2013 , as compared to net income from continuing operations of $317.3 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.52 in 2012 , and net income from continuing operations of $284.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.93 in 2011 . The 2013 results were impacted by a net gain related to property dispositions of $7.2 million ($4.5 million after-tax), and a favorable tax adjustment of $3.4 million . The 2012 results were impacted by a non-cash franchise rights impairment charge of $4.2 million ($2.6 million after-tax). The 2011 results were impacted by a loss on debt extinguishment, including debt refinancing costs and the write-off of previously deferred debt issuance costs, of $2.2 million ($1.4 million after-tax). Market Conditions Full-year U.S. industry new vehicle unit sales were 15.6 million in 2013 , as compared to 14.5 million in 2012 and 12.7 million in 2011 . In 2013 , new vehicle industry sales were driven in part by replacement demand. Based on industry data, the average age of cars and trucks in the United States is at a record high of 11.4 years compared to an average age of 9.8 years during the period from 2002 to 2007. While a robust consumer credit environment and an increase in new product offerings from automotive manufacturers were supportive of a strong selling environment, increased competition pressured 21 Table of Contents new vehicle margins, particularly in the Import segment. New vehicle margin compression was partially offset by continued strength in finance and insurance gross profit per vehicle retailed. We currently anticipate full-year U.S. industry new vehicle unit sales will increase to above 16 million units in 2014 driven by replacement need, attractive products, and continued access to affordable credit. We also believe that improved conditions in the housing market may be supportive of sales. However, actual sales may materially differ. While we expect that the annual rate of U.S. new vehicle unit sales will improve in 2014 as compared to 2013 , we expect that the rate of growth for the industry selling rate will be lower as compared to recent years. If new vehicle production exceeds the new vehicle industry selling rate, our new vehicle margins could be adversely impacted by excess supply and any resulting changes in consumer incentive, marketing, and other programs of vehicle manufacturers. After several years of decline, the number of recent-model-year vehicles in operation has begun to grow due to increases in the annual rate of new vehicle sales in the United States since 2009. The growth in that portion of our service base, together with our customer retention efforts, has benefited the customer-pay service and warranty components of our parts and service business, and we believe that it will continue to benefit those components for the next several years. While the number of older vehicles in operation is expected to decline over the next few years, we believe that overall our parts and service business will benefit from the mix shift in our service base toward newer vehicles. Inventory Management Our new and used vehicle inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We monitor our vehicle inventory levels closely based on current economic conditions and seasonal sales trends. We have generally not experienced losses on the sale of new vehicle inventory, in part due to incentives provided by manufacturers to promote sales of new vehicles and our inventory management practices. We had 72,095 units in new vehicle inventory at December 31, 2013 , and 58,819 units at December 31, 2012 . We recondition the majority of used vehicles acquired for retail sale in our parts and service departments and capitalize the related costs to the used vehicle inventory. Used vehicles that are not sold on a retail basis are generally liquidated at wholesale auctions. We record estimated losses on used vehicle inventory. Our used vehicle inventory balance was net of cumulative write-downs of $1.8 million at December 31, 2013 , and $1.2 million at December 31, 2012 . Parts, accessories, and other inventory are carried at the lower of acquisition cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. We estimate the amount of potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience and market trends. Our parts, accessories, and other inventory balance was net of cumulative write-downs of $3.6 million at December 31, 2013 , and $3.2 million at December 31, 2012 . Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations, based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application. Goodwill Goodwill for our Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury reporting units is tested for impairment annually on April 30 or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Under accounting standards, we chose to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it was necessary to calculate the fair values of our reporting units under the two-step goodwill impairment test. We completed our qualitative assessment of potential goodwill impairment as of April 30, 2013, and we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were less than their carrying amounts. 22 Table of Contents The quantitative goodwill impairment analysis is dependent on many variables used to determine the fair value of our reporting units. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on how the fair values and carrying values of our reporting units are derived for the quantitative goodwill impairment test. As of December 31, 2013 , we have $165.2 million of goodwill related to the Domestic reporting unit, $555.8 million related to the Import reporting unit, and $538.6 million related to the Premium Luxury reporting unit. The fair values of the Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values as of April 30, 2011, the date of our most recent quantitative impairment test. Other Intangible Assets Our principal identifiable intangible assets are individual store rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers, which have indefinite lives and are tested for impairment annually on April 30 or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Under accounting standards, we chose to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of franchise rights impairment to determine whether it was necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. We completed our qualitative assessment of franchise rights impairment as of April 30, 2013 and we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of our franchise rights were less than their carrying amounts. The quantitative impairment test for intangibles with indefinite lives is dependent on many variables used to determine the fair value of our franchise rights. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on how fair value measurements are derived for our franchise rights for the quantitative impairment test. Long-Lived Assets We estimate the depreciable lives of our property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and review them for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired. Such events or changes may include a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, a current expectation that more-likely-than-not a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses. When evaluating potential impairment of long-lived assets held and used, we first compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, we then compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group estimated fair value to determine if impairment exists. The fair value measurements for our long-lived assets held and used were based on Level 3 inputs, which considered information obtained from third-party real estate valuation sources. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our fair value measurements. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset group carrying amount exceeds the asset group estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset group becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset. During 2013 and 2012, we fully impaired certain long-lived assets held and used in continuing operations and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.7 million in 2013 and $0.8 million in 2012. These charges are recorded as a component of Other Expenses (Income), Net in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are reported in the Corporate and other category of our segment information. When property and equipment is identified as held for sale, we reclassify the held for sale assets to Other Current Assets and cease recording depreciation. We measure each long-lived asset or disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and recognize a loss for any initial adjustment of the long-lived asset or disposal group carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell in the period the held for sale criteria are met. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if, based on market conditions, the values of these assets should be adjusted. Any subsequent change in the fair value less cost to sell (increase or decrease) of each asset held for sale is reported as an adjustment to its carrying amount, except that the adjusted carrying amount cannot exceed the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. Such valuations include estimations of fair values and incremental direct costs to transact a sale. The fair value measurements for our long- 23 Table of Contents lived assets held for sale were based on Level 3 inputs, which considered information obtained from third-party real estate valuation sources, or, in certain cases, pending agreements to sell the related assets. We had assets held for sale in continuing operations of $59.8 million at December 31, 2013 , and $70.4 million at December 31, 2012 . We recorded no impairment charges in 2013 or 2012 associated with assets held for sale in continuing operations. We had assets held for sale in discontinued operations of $34.5 million at December 31, 2013 , and $43.2 million at December 31, 2012 . We recorded no impairment charges during 2013 and a $0.1 million non-cash impairment charge in 2012 associated with assets held for sale in discontinued operations to reduce the carrying value of these assets to fair value less cost to sell. This charge is recorded as a component of Loss from Discontinued Operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future undiscounted cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets. Although we believe our property and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued, the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets. Chargeback Reserve Revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for: (i) loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed, (ii) vehicle service contracts sold, and (iii) other protection products sold. We primarily sell these products on a straight commission basis; however we also participate in future underwriting profit on certain extended service contracts pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements, which are recognized as earned. We may be charged back for commissions related to financing, vehicle service contracts, or other protection products in the event of early termination, default, or prepayment of the contracts by customers ( chargebacks ). However, our exposure to loss generally is limited to the commissions that we receive. These commissions are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles, net of an estimated liability for chargebacks. We estimate our liability for chargebacks on an individual product basis using our historical chargeback experience, based primarily on cancellation data we receive from third parties that sell and administer these products. Our estimated liability for chargebacks totaled $67.6 million at December 31, 2013 , and $56.0 million at December 31, 2012 . Chargebacks are influenced by the volume of vehicle sales in recent years and increases or decreases in early termination rates resulting from cancellation of vehicle service contracts and other protection products, defaults, refinancings, payoffs before maturity, and other factors. While we consider these factors in the estimation of our chargeback liability, actual events may differ from our estimates, which could result in a change in our estimated liability for chargebacks. The increase in our liability for chargebacks is largely attributable to higher volume of vehicle sales in recent years, as well as an increase in the cancellation rate of finance and insurance products. A 10% change in our estimated cancellation rates would have changed our estimated liability for chargebacks at December 31, 2013 , by approximately $6.8 million . See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding chargeback liabilities. Self Insurance Reserves Under our self insurance programs, we retain various levels of aggregate loss limits, per claim deductibles, and claims-handling expenses as part of our various insurance programs, including property and casualty, employee medical benefits, automobile, and workers compensation. Costs in excess of this retained risk per claim may be insured under various contracts with third-party insurance carriers. We review our claim and loss history on a periodic basis to assist in assessing our future liability. The ultimate costs of these retained insurance risks are estimated by management and by third-party actuarial evaluation of historical claims experience, adjusted for current trends and changes in claims-handling procedures. Our results could be materially impacted by claims and other expenses related to our self insurance programs if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Self insurance reserves totaled $66.3 million at December 31, 2013 , and $61.5 million at December 31, 2012 . We believe our actual loss experience has not been materially different from our recorded estimates. 24 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Revenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles, sales of parts and services, commissions from finance and insurance products, and sales of other products. We recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided. We recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed, the vehicle has been delivered, and payment has been received or financing has been arranged. Rebates, holdbacks, floorplan assistance, and certain other incentives received from manufacturers are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program, whichever is later. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding revenue recognition. Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We regularly evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and provide valuation allowances to offset portions of deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding the future realization of such deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax-planning strategies. We adjust the valuation allowance in the period we determine it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will not be realized. If a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be adjusted in the period when the change in circumstances occurs. Accounting for our income taxes also requires significant judgment in the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and in the calculation of our provision for income taxes. Accounting standards prescribe a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate available evidence to determine if it appears more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained on an audit by a taxing authority, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settling the uncertain tax position. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, the ultimate outcome of these tax matters may differ from our expectations. We adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the completion of a tax audit, expiration of a statute of limitations, the refinement of an estimate, and interest accruals associated with uncertain tax positions until they are resolved. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our deferred tax assets or liabilities, the valuation of our uncertain tax positions, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. Other Additionally, estimates have been made by us in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements including allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals related to certain legal proceedings, estimated losses from disposals of discontinued operations, and certain assumptions related to determining stock-based compensation. 25 Table of Contents Reported Operating Data Years Ended December 31, ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 2013 2012 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance 2011 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance Revenue: New vehicle $ 9,949.6 $ 8,906.2 $ 1,043.4 11.7 $ 7,498.9 $ 1,407.3 18.8 Retail used vehicle 3,697.9 3,230.0 467.9 14.5 3,047.6 182.4 6.0 Wholesale 429.5 484.3 (54.8 ) (11.3 ) 465.2 19.1 4.1 Used vehicle 4,127.4 3,714.3 413.1 11.1 3,512.8 201.5 5.7 Finance and insurance, net 674.0 571.2 102.8 18.0 474.5 96.7 20.4 Total variable operations (1) 14,751.0 13,191.7 1,559.3 11.8 11,486.2 1,705.5 14.8 Parts and service 2,597.4 2,399.2 198.2 8.3 2,293.1 106.1 4.6 Other 169.2 76.6 92.6 53.0 23.6 Total revenue $ 17,517.6 $ 15,667.5 $ 1,850.1 11.8 $ 13,832.3 $ 1,835.2 13.3 Gross profit: New vehicle $ 616.4 $ 579.5 $ 36.9 6.4 $ 547.7 $ 31.8 5.8 Retail used vehicle 325.2 293.7 31.5 10.7 280.6 13.1 4.7 Wholesale 4.5 5.5 (1.0 ) 4.2 1.3 Used vehicle 329.7 299.2 30.5 10.2 284.8 14.4 5.1 Finance and insurance 674.0 571.2 102.8 18.0 474.5 96.7 20.4 Total variable operations (1) 1,620.1 1,449.9 170.2 11.7 1,307.0 142.9 10.9 Parts and service 1,105.8 1,008.0 97.8 9.7 970.1 37.9 3.9 Other 34.0 28.3 5.7 26.9 1.4 Total gross profit 2,759.9 2,486.2 273.7 11.0 2,304.0 182.2 7.9 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 1,935.0 1,749.3 (185.7 ) (10.6 ) 1,649.4 (99.9 ) (6.1 ) Depreciation and amortization 95.3 87.3 (8.0 ) 83.7 (3.6 ) Franchise rights impairment 4.2 4.2 (4.2 ) Other expenses (income), net (10.7 ) 0.1 10.8 (1.1 ) (1.2 ) Operating income 740.3 645.3 95.0 14.7 572.0 73.3 12.8 Non-operating income (expense) items: Floorplan interest expense (53.4 ) (45.5 ) (7.9 ) (42.7 ) (2.8 ) Other interest expense (88.3 ) (86.9 ) (1.4 ) (66.0 ) (20.9 ) Loss on debt extinguishment (2.2 ) 2.2 Interest income 0.2 0.3 (0.1 ) 0.7 (0.4 ) Other income (losses), net 5.6 3.6 2.0 (0.5 ) 4.1 Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 604.4 $ 516.8 $ 87.6 17.0 $ 461.3 $ 55.5 12.0 Retail vehicle unit sales: New vehicle 292,922 267,784 25,138 9.4 224,034 43,750 19.5 Used vehicle 204,572 180,955 23,617 13.1 171,094 9,861 5.8 497,494 448,739 48,755 10.9 395,128 53,611 13.6 Revenue per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 33,967 $ 33,259 $ 708 2.1 $ 33,472 $ (213 ) (0.6 ) Used vehicle $ 18,076 $ 17,850 $ 226 1.3 $ 17,812 $ 38 0.2 Gross profit per vehicle retailed: New vehicle $ 2,104 $ 2,164 $ (60 ) (2.8 ) $ 2,445 $ (281 ) (11.5 ) Used vehicle $ 1,590 $ 1,623 $ (33 ) (2.0 ) $ 1,640 $ (17 ) (1.0 ) Finance and insurance $ 1,355 $ 1,273 $ 82 6.4 $ 1,201 $ 72 6.0 Total variable operations (2) $ 3,247 $ 3,219 $ 28 0.9 $ 3,297 $ (78 ) (2.4 ) (1) Total variable operations includes new vehicle, used vehicle (retail and wholesale), and finance and insurance results.

The increase in same store unit volume was primarily due to replacement demand and improved market conditions, including increased consumer borrowing and improved consumer confidence as compared to the prior year. An improved credit environment and an increase in new product offerings from automotive manufacturers also favorably impacted same store unit volume. Same store revenue per new vehicle retailed during 2013 benefited from an increase in the average selling prices for new vehicles in all three segments, as well as a shift in mix away from import vehicles, which have relatively lower average selling prices. Same store gross profit per new vehicle retailed decreased during 2013, as compared to 2012, primarily due to a decrease in gross profit per vehicle retailed for import vehicles. 2012 compared to 2011 Same store new vehicle revenue increased during 2012, as compared to 2011, as a result of an increase in same store unit volume, partially offset by a decrease in same store revenue per new vehicle retailed. The increase in same store unit volume was due to significantly improved inventory levels of vehicles produced by Japanese manufacturers, as well as to replacement demand and improved market conditions, including increased consumer borrowing and improved consumer confidence as compared to the prior year. An improved credit environment and an increase in new product offerings from automotive manufacturers also favorably impacted same store unit volume. Same store revenue per new vehicle retailed during 2012, as compared to 2011, was adversely impacted by a shift in mix away from premium luxury and domestic vehicles to import vehicles, which have relatively lower average selling 30 Table of Contents prices, primarily as a result of the improved inventory levels of vehicles produced by Japanese manufacturers as compared to the prior year. Same store revenue per new vehicle retailed was also adversely impacted by a decrease in the average selling price for import vehicles as the prior year benefited from the supply and demand imbalances resulting from the Japan supply constraints. Same store gross profit per new vehicle retailed decreased during 2012, as compared to 2011, primarily due to 2011 benefiting from the tight supply of vehicles produced by Japanese manufacturers and by certain performance-based manufacturer incentives related to premium luxury vehicles previously sold. These incentives were $7.0 million higher during 2011 as compared to 2012. New Vehicle Inventories Our new vehicle inventories were $2.3 billion or 62 days supply at December 31, 2013 , as compared to new vehicle inventories of $1.9 billion or 54 days supply at December 31, 2012 . We had 72,095 units in new vehicle inventory at December 31, 2013 , and 58,819 units at December 31, 2012 . The following table details net new vehicle inventory carrying benefit, consisting of new vehicle floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance earned (amounts received from manufacturers specifically to support store financing of new vehicle inventory).

Floorplan assistance increased due to a change in a manufacturer floorplan assistance program and higher new vehicle sales. Floorplan interest expense increased due to higher average vehicle floorplan payable balances during the year, partially offset by lower negotiated floorplan interest rates. 2012 compared to 2011 The net new vehicle inventory carrying benefit increased in 2012 , as compared to 2011 , due to an increase in floorplan assistance, partially offset by an increase in floorplan interest expense. Floorplan assistance increased due to higher new vehicle sales and an increase in the floorplan assistance rate per unit. Floorplan interest expense increased due to higher average vehicle floorplan payable balances during the year, partially offset by lower negotiated floorplan interest rates. 31 Table of Contents Used Vehicle Years Ended December 31, 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) 2013 2012 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance 2011 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance Reported: Retail revenue $ 3,697.9 $ 3,230.0 $ 467.9 14.5 $ 3,047.6 $ 182.4 6.0 Wholesale revenue 429.5 484.3 (54.8 ) (11.3 ) 465.2 19.1 4.1 Total revenue $ 4,127.4 $ 3,714.3 $ 413.1 11.1 $ 3,512.8 $ 201.5 5.7 Retail gross profit $ 325.2 $ 293.7 $ 31.5 10.7 $ 280.6 $ 13.1 4.7 Wholesale gross profit 4.5 5.5 (1.0 ) 4.2 1.3 Total gross profit $ 329.7 $ 299.2 $ 30.5 10.2 $ 284.8 $ 14.4 5.1 Retail vehicle unit sales 204,572 180,955 23,617 13.1 171,094 9,861 5.8 Revenue per vehicle retailed $ 18,076 $ 17,850 $ 226 1.3 $ 17,812 $ 38 0.2 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,590 $ 1,623 $ (33 ) (2.0 ) $ 1,640 $ (17 ) (1.0 ) Gross profit as a percentage of retail revenue 8.8 % 9.1 % 9.2 % Days supply (trailing calendar month days) 35 days 35 days Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2013 vs. 2012 2012 2011 2012 vs. 2011 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance Same Store: Retail revenue $ 3,554.5 $ 3,227.0 $ 327.5 10.1 $ 3,208.9 $ 3,047.6 $ 161.3 5.3 Wholesale revenue 411.3 483.8 (72.5 ) (15.0 ) 473.6 465.2 8.4 1.8 Total revenue $ 3,965.8 $ 3,710.8 $ 255.0 6.9 $ 3,682.5 $ 3,512.8 $ 169.7 4.8 Retail gross profit $ 314.9 $ 293.4 $ 21.5 7.3 $ 291.5 $ 280.6 $ 10.9 3.9 Wholesale gross profit 4.4 5.5 (1.1 ) 5.5 4.2 1.3 Total gross profit $ 319.3 $ 298.9 $ 20.4 6.8 $ 297.0 $ 284.8 $ 12.2 4.3 Retail vehicle unit sales 197,233 180,842 16,391 9.1 179,669 171,094 8,575 5.0 Revenue per vehicle retailed $ 18,022 $ 17,844 $ 178 1.0 $ 17,860 $ 17,812 $ 48 0.3 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,597 $ 1,622 $ (25 ) (1.5 ) $ 1,622 $ 1,640 $ (18 ) (1.1 ) Gross profit as a percentage of retail revenue 8.9 % 9.1 % 9.1 % 9.2 % 2013 compared to 2012 Same store retail used vehicle revenue increased during 2013, as compared to 2012, due to an increase in same store unit volume and an increase in revenue per used vehicle retailed. Same store unit volume benefited from an increase in sales of certified pre-owned vehicles, as well as an increase in trade-in volume. Same store revenue per used vehicle retailed during 2013 benefited from a shift in mix toward premium luxury vehicles, which have relatively higher average selling prices, partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price for import vehicles.

See Market Conditions above. Gross profit associated with the preparation of vehicles for sale benefited from higher new and used vehicle unit volume. Customer-pay service gross profit benefited from improved operational execution and improved margin performance. Gross profit associated with our collision business benefited from increased volume, improved productivity, and improved margin performance. 2012 compared to 2011 Same store parts and service gross profit increased during 2012, as compared to 2011, primarily due to increases in gross profit associated with the preparation of vehicles for sale of $25.1 million, customer-pay service of $7.5 million, and collision business of $2.7 million, partially offset by a decline in gross profit associated with warranty of $1.2 million. Gross profit associated with the preparation of vehicles for sale benefited from higher new and used vehicle unit volume. Customer-pay service gross profit benefited from improved market conditions and better marketing of products and services in the service department. Gross profit associated with our collision business benefited from expanded relationships with insurance providers and increased capacity at certain of our collision centers. Warranty gross profit was adversely impacted during 2012 by fewer vehicles in operation as a result of historically lower vehicle sales in recent years and, to a lesser extent, improved quality of vehicles manufactured in recent years. 34 Table of Contents Finance and Insurance Years Ended December 31, ($ in millions, except per vehicle data) 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 2013 2012 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance 2011 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance Reported: Revenue and gross profit $ 674.0 $ 571.2 $ 102.8 18.0 $ 474.5 $ 96.7 20.4 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,355 $ 1,273 $ 82 6.4 $ 1,201 $ 72 6.0 Years Ended December 31, 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 2013 2012 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance 2012 2011 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance Same Store: Revenue and gross profit $ 651.6 $ 570.6 $ 81.0 14.2 $ 568.1 $ 474.5 $ 93.6 19.7 Gross profit per vehicle retailed $ 1,361 $ 1,273 $ 88 6.9 $ 1,275 $ 1,201 $ 74 6.2 2013 compared to 2012 Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased during 2013, as compared to 2012, due to increases in same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed and new and used vehicle unit volume.

Domestic segment income increased during 2013, as compared to 2012, primarily due to an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit, which benefited from an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit per vehicle retailed and higher new and used vehicle unit volume. Domestic segment income also benefited from increases in new and used vehicle gross profit and parts and service gross profit, and from the acquisition noted in the paragraph above. Increases in Domestic segment income were partially offset by an increase in variable expenses. 2012 compared to 2011 Domestic revenue increased during 2012, as compared to 2011, primarily due to an increase in new vehicle unit volume and an increase in revenue per new vehicle retailed. The increase in new vehicle unit volume was due in part to replacement demand and improved market conditions, including increased consumer borrowing and improved consumer confidence as compared to the prior year. An improved credit environment and an increase in new product offerings from automotive manufacturers also favorably impacted new vehicle unit volume. New vehicle revenue and unit sales increased for all three domestic manufacturers as compared to 2011. Domestic segment income increased during 2012, as compared to 2011, primarily due to an increase in finance and insurance revenue and gross profit, which benefited from higher new and used vehicle unit volume, as well as an increase in new vehicle gross profit due to higher new vehicle unit volume. Increases in Domestic segment income were partially offset by an increase in variable expenses. 37 Table of Contents Import The Import segment operating results included the following: Years Ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2013 2012 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance 2011 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance Revenue $ 6,375.0 $ 5,827.5 $ 547.5 9.4 $ 4,933.3 $ 894.2 18.1 Segment income $ 280.1 $ 257.9 $ 22.2 8.6 $ 227.1 $ 30.8 13.6 Retail new vehicle unit sales 143,325 133,912 9,413 7.0 106,175 27,737 26.1 2013 compared to 2012 Import revenue increased during 2013, as compared to 2012, primarily due to an increase in new vehicle unit volume.

Increases in Premium Luxury segment income were partially offset by an increase in variable expenses. The year ended December 31, 2011, was also more favorably impacted by a higher amount of certain performance-based manufacturer incentives as noted above in the New Vehicle section. 39 Table of Contents Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses Our Selling, General, and Administrative expenses ( SG&A ) consist primarily of compensation, including store and corporate salaries, commissions, and incentive-based compensation, as well as advertising (net of reimbursement-based manufacturer advertising rebates), and store and corporate overhead expenses, which include occupancy costs, legal, accounting, and professional services, and general corporate expenses. The following table presents the major components of our SG&A. Years Ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2013 2012 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance 2011 Variance Favorable / (Unfavorable) % Variance Reported: Compensation $ 1,252.9 $ 1,137.3 $ (115.6 ) (10.2 ) $ 1,050.8 $ (86.5 ) (8.2 ) Advertising 166.4 135.7 (30.7 ) (22.6 ) 130.2 (5.5 ) (4.2 ) Store and corporate overhead 515.7 476.3 (39.4 ) (8.3 ) 468.4 (7.9 ) (1.7 ) Total $ 1,935.0 $ 1,749.3 $ (185.7 ) (10.6 ) $ 1,649.4 $ (99.9 ) (6.1 ) SG&A as a % of total gross profit: Compensation 45.4 45.7 30 bps 45.6 (10 ) bps Advertising 6.0 5.5 (50 ) bps 5.7 20 bps Store and corporate overhead 18.7 19.2 50 bps 20.3 110 bps Total 70.1 70.4 30 bps 71.6 120 bps 2013 compared to 2012 SG&A expenses increased in 2013 , as compared to 2012 , primarily due to a performance-driven increase in compensation expense and increases in gross advertising expenditures and store and corporate overhead expenses. As a percentage of total gross profit, SG&A expenses decreased to 70.1% in 2013 from 70.4% in 2012 resulting from our continued effective management of our cost structure and improved gross profit, partially offset by an increase in expenses resulting from our re-branding initiative noted below. 2012 compared to 2011 SG&A expenses increased in 2012 , as compared to 2011 , primarily due to a performance-driven increase in compensation expense, an increase in gross advertising expenditures, which was partially offset by an increase in advertising reimbursements from manufacturers, and an increase in store and corporate overhead expenses. As a percentage of total gross profit, SG&A expenses decreased to 70.4% in 2012 from 71.6% in 2011 resulting from our continued effective management of our cost structure, improved associate productivity, and improved gross profit. Re-Branding Initiative On January 31, 2013, we announced that we would be marketing our Domestic and Import stores under the AutoNation retail brand. The re-branding of these stores, which previously operated under various local market retail brands, commenced in the first quarter of 2013 and was completed in the second quarter of 2013. As part of this re-branding initiative, we incurred non-recurring SG&A expenses, primarily related to advertising, of approximately $18 million during 2013. Operating Expenses (Income), net During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recognized a net gain related to property dispositions of $7.2 million ($4.5 million after-tax). 40 Table of Contents Non-Operating Income (Expenses) Floorplan Interest Expense Floorplan interest expense was $53.4 million in 2013 , $45.5 million in 2012 , and $42.7 million in 2011 . 2013 compared to 2012 The increase in floorplan interest expense of $7.9 million in 2013 , as compared to 2012 , is primarily the result of higher average vehicle floorplan balances, partially offset by lower negotiated floorplan interest rates. 2012 compared to 2011 The increase in floorplan interest expense of $2.8 million in 2012 , as compared to 2011 , is primarily the result of higher average vehicle floorplan balances, partially offset by lower negotiated floorplan interest rates. Other Interest Expense Other interest expense was incurred primarily on borrowings under our outstanding senior unsecured notes, mortgage facility, revolving credit facility, and term loan facility. 2013 compared to 2012 Other interest expense of $88.3 million in 2013 was relatively flat compared to $86.9 million in 2012 . 2012 compared to 2011 Other interest expense was $86.9 million in 2012 , compared to $66.0 million in 2011 . The increase in other interest expense of $20.9 million in 2012 , as compared to 2011 , was primarily due to a $17.6 million increase resulting from the February 2012 issuance of our 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020 and a $5.5 million increase resulting from higher levels of debt outstanding during the year associated with our revolving credit facility and capital lease and other debt obligations. These increases were partially offset by decreases in interest expense of $2.5 million resulting from lower interest rates on our term loan facility, $0.7 million resulting from the redemption of our 7% Senior Notes due 2014, and $0.4 million resulting from lower levels of debt outstanding during the year associated with our mortgage facility. Loss on Debt Extinguishment During 2011, we expensed $2.2 million pre-tax related to a debt refinancing transaction. These expenses included $0.4 million for the write-off of previously deferred debt issuance costs. Provision for Income Taxes Income taxes are provided based upon our anticipated underlying annual blended federal and state income tax rates, adjusted, as necessary, for any other tax matters occurring during the period. As we operate in various states, our effective tax rate is also dependent upon our geographic revenue mix. Our effective income tax rate was 37.8% in 2013 . During the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed a restructuring of certain of our subsidiaries, a consequence of which was the release of a valuation allowance of $3.4 million , which was reflected as a benefit in our income tax provision for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2013. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our unrecognized tax benefits. We do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease during the twelve months beginning January 1, 2014 . Our effective income tax rate was 38.6% in 2012 . Our effective income tax rate was 38.4% in 2011 , which reflected the benefit of certain favorable tax adjustments. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations are related to stores that were sold or terminated, that we have entered into an agreement to sell or terminate, or for which we otherwise deem a proposed sales transaction or termination to be probable, with no material changes expected. We have accounted for a store that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale as a 41 Table of Contents discontinued operation if (a) the operations and cash flows of the store were eliminated from our ongoing operations and (b) we had no significant continuing involvement in the operations of the store after the disposal transaction. In evaluating whether a store cash flows were eliminated from our ongoing operations, we considered whether we expected to continue to generate revenues or incur expenses from the sale of similar products or services to customers of the disposed store in the same geographic market. If we believed that a significant portion of the cash flows previously generated by the disposed store had migrated to our other operating stores, we did not treat the disposition as a discontinued operation. We had a loss from discontinued operations totaling $0.9 million in 2013 , net of income taxes, primarily related to carrying costs for real estate we have not yet sold associated with stores that have been closed and other adjustments related to disposed operations, partially offset by a gain on disposal of a store during the second quarter of 2013. We had a loss from discontinued operations totaling $0.9 million in 2012 , net of income taxes, primarily related to carrying costs for real estate we have not yet sold associated with stores that have been closed. We had a loss from discontinued operations totaling $2.8 million in 2011 , net of income taxes, primarily related to carrying costs for real estate we have not yet sold associated with stores that have been closed, as well as expected losses on real estate to be sold. Liquidity and Capital Resources We manage our liquidity to ensure access to sufficient funding at acceptable costs to fund our ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures while continuing to meet our financial obligations. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, funds generated through future operations, and amounts available under our revolving credit facility and secured used vehicle floorplan facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, service our debt, pay our tax obligations and commitments and contingencies, and meet any seasonal operating requirements for the foreseeable future. Available Liquidity Resources We had the following sources of liquidity available for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 : (In millions) December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 69.2 $ 69.7 Revolving Credit Facility (1) $ 854.4 $ 603.5 Secured Used Floorplan Facilities (2) $ 50.0 $ 92.9 (1) Based on aggregate borrowings outstanding of $300.0 million and outstanding letters of credit of $45.6 million at December 31, 2013 , and aggregate borrowings outstanding of $540.0 million and outstanding letters of credit of $56.5 million at December 31, 2012 . See Long-Term Debt Credit Agreement for additional information. (2) Based on the eligible used vehicle inventory that could have been pledged as collateral. See Long-Term Debt Vehicle Floorplan Payable for additional information. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and/or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2013 , surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash deposits totaled $91.3 million , including the $45.6 million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. Capital Allocation Our capital allocation strategy is focused on maximizing stockholder returns. The first priority of our capital allocation strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet. Second, we invest capital in our business to maintain and upgrade our existing facilities and to build new facilities, as well as for other strategic and technology initiatives. Third, we deploy capital opportunistically to repurchase our common stock and/or debt or to complete dealership acquisitions and/or build facilities for newly awarded franchises. Our capital allocation decisions will be based on factors such as the expected rate 42 Table of Contents of return on our investment, the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value, the market price of our debt, the potential impact on our capital structure, our ability to complete dealership acquisitions that meet our market and vehicle brand criteria and return on investment threshold, and limitations set forth in our debt agreements. Share Repurchases A summary of shares repurchased under our share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors follows: (In millions, except per share data) 2013 2012 2011 Shares repurchased 1.1 16.6 17.1 Aggregate purchase price $ 53.5 $ 580.6 $ 583.4 Average purchase price per share $ 47.37 $ 34.89 $ 34.14 The decision to repurchase shares at any given point in time is based on such factors as the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value, the potential impact on our capital structure (including compliance with our 3.75x maximum leverage ratio and other financial covenants in our debt agreements as well as our available liquidity), and the expected return on competing uses of capital such as dealership acquisitions, capital investments in our current businesses, or repurchases of our debt. In January 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $250 million under our existing share repurchase program. From January 1, 2014 through February 12, 2014 we repurchased an additional 2.4 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $115.7 million (average purchase price per share of $47.92 ). As of February 12, 2014 , $400.0 million remained available for share repurchases under the program. Senior Note Repurchases and Debt Prepayment We may from time to time repurchase our outstanding senior unsecured notes in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. Additionally, we may in the future prepay our term loan facility or other debt. The decision to repurchase senior unsecured notes or to prepay our term loan facility or other debt is based on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. Capital Expenditures The following table sets forth information regarding our capital expenditures over the past three years: (In millions) 2013 2012 2011 Purchases of property and equipment, including operating lease buy-outs (1) $ 207.2 $ 183.6 $ 158.1 (1) Includes accrued construction in progress and excludes property acquired under capital leases. Excluding land purchased for future sites and lease buy-outs, and net of related asset sales, we anticipate that our capital expenditures, including accrued construction in progress, will be approximately $180 million in 2014 primarily related to our store facilities. Acquisitions and Divestitures The following table sets forth information regarding cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and cash received from business divestitures, net of cash relinquished, over the past three years: (In millions) 2013 2012 2011 Cash received from (used in) business acquisitions, net (1) $ (87.9 ) $ (141.6 ) $ (64.2 ) Cash received from (used in) business divestitures, net $ 10.1 $ 6.8 $ 4.9 (1) Excludes capital leases and deferred purchase price commitments. We purchased five stores and related assets during 2013 , compared to six in 2012 and one in 2011 . 43 Table of Contents Cash Dividends We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during our two most recent fiscal years. We do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Long-Term Debt The following table sets forth our non-vehicle long-term debt as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 : (In millions) 2013 2012 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 $ 396.3 $ 395.6 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020 350.0 350.0 Term loan facility due 2016 500.0 500.0 Revolving credit facility due 2016 300.0 540.0 Mortgage facility (1) 194.7 203.3 Capital leases and other debt 98.9 107.2 1,839.9 2,096.1 Less: current maturities (30.1 ) (29.8 ) Long-term debt, net of current maturities $ 1,809.8 $ 2,066.3 (1) The mortgage facility requires monthly principal and interest payments of $1.7 million based on a fixed amortization schedule with a balloon payment of $155.4 million due November 2017. Senior Unsecured Notes At December 31, 2013 , we had outstanding $396.3 million of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018, net of debt discount. Interest is payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year. These notes will mature on April 15, 2018. At December 31, 2013 , we had outstanding $350.0 million of 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020. Interest is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year. At any time prior to February 1, 2015, we may redeem up to 35% of the principal amount of these notes with the net cash proceeds of one or more public equity offerings of our common stock at 105.5% of principal. These notes will mature on February 1, 2020. Our senior unsecured notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. Credit Agreement Under our credit agreement, we have a $500.0 million term loan facility and a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. The term loan and revolving credit facilities under the credit agreement mature on December 7, 2016. As of December 31, 2013 , we had borrowings outstanding of $300.0 million under the revolving credit facility. We have a $200.0 million letter of credit sublimit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit, which was $45.6 million at December 31, 2013 , leaving an additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility of $854.4 million at December 31, 2013 . Funds borrowed under our credit agreement may be used to repay indebtedness, finance acquisitions, and for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, and other general corporate purposes. Our term loan facility provides for various interest rates generally at LIBOR plus 1.75%. Our revolving credit facility provides for a commitment fee on undrawn amounts of 0.30% and various interest rates on borrowings generally at LIBOR plus 1.75%. The credit spread charged for both the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility is affected by our leverage ratio. For instance, an increase in our leverage ratio from greater than or equal to 2.0x but less than 3.25x to greater than or equal to 3.25x would result in a 25 basis point increase in the credit spread under both our term loan facility and revolving credit facility. 44 Table of Contents Borrowings under the credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. Vehicle Floorplan Payable Vehicle floorplan payable-trade totaled $2.1 billion at December 31, 2013 and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2012 . Vehicle floorplan payable-trade reflects amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new vehicle inventories with manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries. Vehicle floorplan payable-non-trade totaled $898.9 million at December 31, 2013 , and $773.9 million at December 31, 2012 , and represents amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new and, to a lesser extent, used vehicle inventories with non-trade lenders, as well as amounts borrowed under our secured used vehicle floorplan facilities, which are primarily collateralized by used vehicle inventories and related receivables. At December 31, 2013 , the aggregate capacity under our used vehicle floorplan facilities was $275.0 million . As of that date, $177.3 million had been borrowed under those facilities, and the remaining borrowing capacity of $97.7 million was limited to $50.0 million based on the eligible used vehicle inventory that could have been pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2012 , the aggregate capacity under our used vehicle floorplan facilities was $275.0 million . As of that date, $119.5 million had been borrowed under those facilities, and the remaining borrowing capacity of $155.5 million was limited to $92.9 million based on the eligible used vehicle inventory that could have been pledged as collateral. All the vehicle floorplan facilities utilize LIBOR-based interest rates. Vehicle floorplan facilities are due on demand, but in the case of new vehicle inventories, are generally paid within several business days after the related vehicles are sold. Our manufacturer agreements generally require that the manufacturer have the ability to draft against the new vehicle floorplan facilities so the lender directly funds the manufacturer for the purchase of new vehicle inventory. Vehicle floorplan facilities are primarily collateralized by vehicle inventories and related receivables. Other Debt At December 31, 2013 , we had $194.7 million outstanding under a mortgage facility with an automotive manufacturer captive finance subsidiary that matures on November 30, 2017. The mortgage facility utilizes a fixed interest rate of 5.864% and is secured by 10-year mortgages on certain of our store properties. The mortgage facility requires monthly principal and interest payments of $1.7 million based on a fixed amortization schedule with a balloon payment of $155.4 million due November 2017. Repayment of the mortgage facility is subject to a prepayment penalty. At December 31, 2013 , we had capital lease and other debt obligations of $98.9 million , which are due at various dates through 2033 . Restrictions and Covenants Our credit agreement, the indentures for our 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 and 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020, our vehicle floorplan facilities, and our mortgage facility contain customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on us, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell (or otherwise dispose of) assets, and to merge or consolidate with other entities. Under our credit agreement we are required to remain in compliance with a maximum leverage ratio and maximum capitalization ratio. The leverage ratio is a contractually defined amount principally reflecting non-vehicle debt divided by a contractually defined measure of earnings with certain adjustments. The capitalization ratio is a contractually defined amount principally reflecting vehicle floorplan payable and non-vehicle debt divided by our total capitalization including vehicle floorplan payable. Under the credit agreement, the maximum leverage ratio is 3.75x and the maximum capitalization ratio is 65.0%. In calculating our leverage and capitalization ratios, we are not required to include letters of credit in the definition of debt (except to the extent of letters of credit in excess of $150.0 million). In addition, in calculating our capitalization ratio, we are permitted to add back to shareholders equity all goodwill, franchise rights, and long-lived asset impairment charges subsequent to September 30, 2011 plus $1.52 billion . The specific terms of these covenants can be found in our credit agreement, which we filed with our Current Report on Form 8-K on December 8, 2011. The indentures for our 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 and 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020 contain certain limited covenants, including limitations on liens and sale and leaseback transactions, but do not contain restricted payments 45 Table of Contents covenants or debt incurrence restrictions. Our mortgage facility contains covenants regarding maximum cash flow leverage and minimum interest coverage. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt agreements could permit acceleration of all of our indebtedness. Our debt agreements have cross-default provisions that trigger a default in the event of an uncured default under other material indebtedness of AutoNation. As of December 31, 2013 , we were in compliance with the requirements of the financial covenants under our debt agreements. Under the terms of our credit agreement, at December 31, 2013 , our leverage ratio and capitalization ratio were as follows: December 31, 2013 Requirement Actual Leverage ratio 3.75x 2.25x Capitalization ratio 65.0% 57.6% Both the leverage ratio and the capitalization ratio limit our ability to incur additional non-vehicle debt. The capitalization ratio also limits our ability to incur additional vehicle floorplan indebtedness. In the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings, none of the covenants described above would be impacted. In addition, availability under the credit agreement described above would not be impacted should a downgrade in the senior unsecured debt credit ratings occur. Cash Flows The following table summarizes the changes in our cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities: Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2013 2012 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 484.1 $ 316.6 $ 376.4 Net cash used in investing activities $ (257.8 ) $ (297.8 ) $ (206.2 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (226.8 ) $ (35.7 ) $ (178.7 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our primary sources of operating cash flows are collections from contracts-in-transit and customers following the sale of vehicles and proceeds from vehicle floorplan payable-trade. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are repayments of vehicle floorplan payable-trade, personnel-related expenditures, and payments related to taxes and leased properties. 2013 compared to 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities increased during 2013 , as compared to 2012 , primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements and an increase in earnings. 2012 compared to 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased during 2012, as compared to 2011, primarily due to an increase in working capital requirements, partially offset by an increase in earnings. During 2011, we paid $14.8 million in connection with refinancing our indebtedness. Cash flows from operating activities reflect $1.8 million of these cash payments that we charged to expense related to this refinancing transaction. In addition, we charged to expense $0.4 million of previously deferred debt issuance costs. Cash flows from financing activities, discussed below, reflect $13.0 million of debt issuance costs that are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the new credit agreement. 46 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used in capital additions, activity from business acquisitions, business divestitures, property dispositions, purchases and sales of investments, and other transactions. We will make facility and infrastructure upgrades and improvements from time to time as we identify projects that are required to maintain our current business or that we expect to provide us with acceptable rates of return. Excluding land purchased for future sites and lease buy-outs, and net of related asset sales, we project that 2014 capital expenditures, including accrued construction in progress, will be approximately $180 million . 2013 compared to 2012 Net cash used in investing activities decreased during 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily due to a decrease in cash used in business acquisitions. 2012 compared to 2011 Net cash used in investing activities increased during 2012 as compared to 2011, primarily due to an increase in cash used in business acquisitions. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities primarily include repurchases of common stock, debt activity, changes in vehicle floorplan payable-non-trade, and proceeds from the stock option exercises. 2013 compared to 2012 During 2013 , under our share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $53.5 million (average purchase price per share of $47.37 ). Additionally, 44,738 shares were surrendered to AutoNation primarily to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock. During 2012 , under our share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, we repurchased 16.6 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $580.6 million (average purchase price per share of $34.89 ), including repurchases for which settlement occurred subsequent to December 31, 2012 . Additionally, 46,467 shares were surrendered to AutoNation to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock. During 2013 , we borrowed $0.8 billion and repaid $1.1 billion under our revolving credit facility, for net repayments of $240.0 million . During 2012 , we borrowed $1.3 billion and repaid $1.2 billion under our revolving credit facility, for net borrowings of $45.0 million . We made payments of capital lease and other debt obligations of $26.2 million during 2013 and $5.0 million during 2012 . On February 1, 2012, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020. See Long-Term Debt - Senior Unsecured Notes above for additional information regarding our 5.5% Senior Notes due 2020. Cash flows from financing activities in 2012 reflect cash payments of $6.0 million for debt issuance costs that are being amortized to expense over the term of the related debt. On April 16, 2012, we redeemed all of our outstanding 7% Senior Notes due 2014 at 100% of principal, for which we paid $14.7 million . Cash flows from financing activities include changes in vehicle floorplan payable-non-trade (vehicle floorplan payables with lenders other than the automotive manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries for that franchise) totaling net proceeds of $89.0 million during 2013 compared to net proceeds of $138.1 million in 2012 . During 2013 , cash flows from financing activities were also impacted by a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options as compared to 2012 . 47 Table of Contents 2012 compared to 2011 Net cash used in financing activities decreased during 2012 , as compared to 2011 , primarily due to the net impact of the debt activity that occurred in 2012, as noted above, and 2011, described below, as well as an increase in net proceeds from vehicle floorplan payable-non-trade, partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2012 as compared to 2011. During 2011, we entered into a new five-year unsecured credit agreement with a $500.0 million term loan facility and a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. The new credit agreement replaced our prior unsecured credit agreement. The prior credit agreement was terminated concurrently with our entry into the new credit agreement, and the indebtedness outstanding under the prior credit agreement was paid off with proceeds from borrowings under the new credit agreement. Cash flows from financing activities in 2011 also reflect cash payments of $13.0 million for debt issuance costs that are being amortized to expense over the term of the new credit agreement.

Estimates of future interest payments for vehicle floorplan payables and other variable rate debt are excluded. (3) Amounts for operating lease commitments do not include certain operating expenses such as maintenance, insurance, and real estate taxes. In 2013 , these charges totaled approximately $22 million . See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Due to uncertainty regarding timing of payments expected beyond one year, long-term obligations for deferred compensation arrangements have been classified in the More Than 5 Years column. (5) Our estimated chargeback obligations do not have scheduled maturities, however, the timing of future payments can be estimated based on historical patterns. (6) Under our self insurance programs, we retain various levels of aggregate loss limits, per claim deductibles, and claims-handling expenses as part of our various insurance programs, including property and casualty, employee medical benefits, automobile, and workers compensation. These amounts are based on management estimates and actuarial calculations. Although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, the timing of future payments is estimated based on historical patterns. 48 Table of Contents (7) Primarily represents purchase orders and contracts in connection with information technology and communication systems, as well as real estate construction projects. In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and/or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2013 , surety bonds, letters of credit, and cash deposits totaled $91.3 million , of which $45.6 million represented letters of credit. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We have negotiated a letter of credit sublimit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under this revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit. As further discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, there are various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2013 , we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Forward-Looking Statements Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the matters discussed below. Certain statements and information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including without limitation statements regarding our expectations for the future performance of our franchises and the automotive retail industry, as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized executive officers on our behalf, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements that describe our objectives, plans or goals are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Words such as anticipate, expect, intend, goal, plan, believe, continue, may, will, and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations concerning future results and events, and they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to revise or update these statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. The risks, uncertainties, and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include, but are not limited to, the following: The automotive retail industry is sensitive to changing economic conditions and various other factors. Our business and results of operations are substantially dependent on new vehicle sales levels in the United States and in our particular geographic markets and the level of gross profit margins that we can achieve on our sales of new vehicles, all of which are very difficult to predict. If we are not able to maintain and enhance our retail brands and reputation, or if events occur that damage our retail brands and reputation, our business and financial results may be harmed. Our debt agreements contain certain financial ratios and other restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, and our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations. We are dependent upon the success and continued financial viability of the vehicle manufacturers and distributors with which we hold franchises. Goodwill and other intangible assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets. We must test our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually, which could result in a material, non-cash write-down of goodwill or franchise rights and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity. 49 Table of Contents Our new vehicle sales are impacted by the consumer incentive, marketing, and other programs of vehicle manufacturers. Natural disasters and adverse weather events can disrupt our business. We are subject to restrictions imposed by, and significant influence from, vehicle manufacturers that may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects, including our ability to acquire additional stores . We are subject to numerous legal and administrative proceedings, which, if the outcomes are adverse to us, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects. Our operations are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations. If we are found to be in purported violation of or subject to liabilities under any of these laws or regulations, or if new laws or regulations are enacted that adversely affect our operations, our business, operating results, and prospects could suffer . We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our vehicle floorplan payables, revolving credit facility, and term loan facility that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Our largest stockholders, as a result of their ownership stakes in us, may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders or Board of Directors. In addition, future share repurchases and fluctuations in the levels of ownership of our largest stockholders could impact the volume of trading, liquidity, and market price of our common stock. A failure of our information systems or any security breach or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our business.
