ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion also should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under the section entitled Risk Factors, Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere herein, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Insmed is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the unmet needs of patients with rare diseases. Our operations are based on the technology and products historically developed by Transave. We have legal entities in the US, Ireland, Germany, France, the United Kingdom (UK), the Netherlands and Japan. We have not generated material revenue to date, except for in 2013, and through December 31, 2017 , we had an accumulated deficit of $957.9 million . We have financed our operations primarily through the public offerings of our equity securities and debt financings. Although it is difficult to predict our future funding requirements, based upon our current operating plan, we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 will enable us to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. We expect that over the next few years we will continue to incur losses from operations as we increase our expenditures in research and development in connection with our ongoing and future clinical trials, and for expenses related to the preparation for the commercial launch of ALIS globally, if approved. PIPELINE PROGRESS ALIS for Patients with NTM Lung Disease Our lead product candidate is ALIS, a novel, once-daily liposomal formulation of amikacin that is in late-stage clinical development for adult patients with treatment refractory NTM lung disease caused by MAC, a rare and often chronic infection that can cause irreversible lung damage and can be fatal. Amikacin solution for parenteral administration is an established drug that has activity against a variety of NTM; however, its use is limited by the need to administer it intravenously and by toxicity to hearing, balance, and kidney function (Peloquin et al., 2004). Unlike amikacin solution for intravenous administration, our advanced liposome technology uses charge-neutral liposomes to deliver amikacin directly to the lung where it is taken up by the lung macrophages where the NTM infection resides. This technology prolongs the release of amikacin in the lungs, while minimizing systemic exposure thereby, offering the potential for decreased systemic toxicities. ALIS ability to deliver high levels of amikacin directly to the lung distinguishes it from intravenous amikacin. ALIS is administered once-daily, using a portable aerosol delivery system, via an optimized, investigational eFlow Nebulizer System manufactured by PARI. The FDA has designated ALIS as an orphan drug, a breakthrough therapy, and a QIDP for NTM lung disease. Orphan designation features seven years of post-approval marketing exclusivity in the approved indication, and QIDP features an additional five years of post-approval exclusivity in the approved indication. As a result, ALIS could have 12 years of post-approval marketing exclusivity in the US, if approved. A QIDP-designated product is eligible for fast track status and is often granted priority review status. A priority review designation for a drug which is not a NME means the FDA goal is to take action on the NDA within six months following the receipt of the NDA. The CONVERT Study and 312 Study CONVERT Top-Line Efficacy Data We announced top-line data for the CONVERT study on September 5, 2017. The CONVERT study enrolled 336 adult patients with NTM lung disease caused by MAC who were refractory to at least six months of treatment on current GBT of a multi-drug regimen. After a screening period of up to 10 weeks, eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to once-daily ALIS plus GBT or GBT only. The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients achieving culture conversion, which we defined as three consecutive monthly negative sputum cultures, by month six. Based on top-line results, the CONVERT study met its primary endpoint, with 29% of patients in the ALIS plus GBT arm achieving culture conversion, compared to 9% of patients in the GBT-only arm (p<0.0001). 60 Table of Contents We also reported top-line data for certain secondary and exploratory endpoints for the first six months of the study. Top-line data for the six-minute walk test indicated no statistically significant difference between patients in the two arms of the study. However, an analysis of these data (per a pre-specified exploratory endpoint) showed that patients who achieved culture conversion in either arm demonstrated an improvement in six-minute walk distance when compared to patients who did not culture convert (p=0.0108). Top-line data for the secondary endpoint of time to conversion demonstrated that patients in the GBT-only arm took approximately 30% longer to convert when compared to patients on ALIS plus GBT (p<0.0001). We are continuing our analysis of the impact of conversion on a variety of other clinical measures. The protocol for the CONVERT study incorporates feedback from the FDA and the EMA via its scientific advice working party process, as well as local health authorities in other countries, including Japan PMDA. Because the CONVERT study met the primary endpoint of culture conversion at month six based on the top-line results, we plan to submit an NDA for ALIS to the FDA by the end of March 2018 pursuant to Subpart H, which permits the FDA to approve a product candidate based on a surrogate or intermediate endpoint subject to the requirement that we conduct post-approval studies to verify and describe the clinical benefit of the product. We expect to receive a six-month priority review from the FDA. We believe that efficacy data from the CONVERT study at month six will be sufficient to support the accelerated approval of ALIS. We expect that full approval would be contingent on FDA review of, among other things, the final analyses of durability of culture conversion for converters. CONVERT Top-Line Safety and Tolerability Data Approximately 98% of patients in the ALIS plus GBT arm of the CONVERT study experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), compared to 91% of patients in the GBT-only arm, with most events being mild or moderate in severity. A greater percentage of patients in the ALIS plus GBT arm than in the GBT-only arm experienced TEAEs involving dysphonia, cough, haemoptysis, dyspnoea, oropharyngeal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue. Based on our review of the top line study safety data, the incidence of dysphonia, cough and dyspnoea among patients in the ALIS plus GBT arm generally decreased after the second study month. Approximately 20% and 18% of patients in the ALIS plus GBT arm and GBT-only arm of the study, respectively, experienced at least one serious treatment emergent adverse event (STEAE). The table below provides additional information regarding certain STEAEs experienced by patients in the CONVERT study. 2:1 Randomization Patients Reporting STEAEs >3% in Either Arm ALIS + GBT (n=223) GBT (n=112) Patients Reporting At Least One STEAE 20.2% (45) 17.9% (20) System Organ Class Preferred Term Respiratory, Thoracic, Mediastinal Disorders 11.7% (26) 9.8% (11) Hemoptysis 2.7% (6) 4.5% (5) COPD (exacerbation) 3.1% (7) 0.9% (1) Infections and Infestations 9.0% (20) 5.4% (6) Pneumonia 3.6% (8) 1.8% (2) Cardiac Disorders 0.4% (1) 4.5% (5) Patient Deaths 2.7% (6) 4.5% (5) There were no distinctions between treatment arms for adverse events of hearing loss or renal impairment, side effects commonly associated with the intravenous use of amikacin. As of September 2017, the overall dropout rate in the CONVERT study was 16.1%, with an 8.9% dropout rate in the GBT-only arm and a 19.6% dropout rate in the ALIS plus GBT arm. As of December 2017, the overall dropout rate in the CONVERT study was 18% (n=60/336). CONVERT Long-Term Durability Data We also recently announced interim data on the durability of culture conversion, as defined by patients that have completed treatment and continued in the CONVERT study off all therapy for three months, which we expect will be the endpoint necessary to support full regulatory approval in the US. The following data are interim results observed through December 2017, and have not been further analyzed. As of December 2017, of the 75 patients achieving culture conversion in the CONVERT study, 53 of these patients were evaluable for durability of culture conversion three months after the completion of treatment. Interim data for durability of culture conversion as of December 2017 on these 53 patients are detailed below: 61 Table of Contents Evaluable Number of Patients as of December 2017 (At Least Three Months Post Treatment) * Percent with Durable Culture Conversion Three Months After Completion of All Treatment Converters in the ALIS + GBT arm (n=65) 46 60.9% (28/46) Converters in the GBT only arm (n=10) 7 0.0% (0/7) * Evaluable number of patients includes all patients who reached three months post-treatment and all patients who discontinued prior to three months post-treatment. 312 Study All non-converters in the CONVERT study, as determined at the month eight visit, may be eligible to enter the 312 study, which is a separate 12-month, single-arm, open-label study. The purpose of the 312 study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of longer-term treatment with ALIS added to GBT. The secondary endpoints of the 312 study include evaluating the proportion of patients achieving culture conversion (three consecutive monthly negative sputum cultures) by month six and the proportion of patients achieving culture conversion by month 12 (end of treatment). 312 Study Interim Efficacy Data We recently announced interim data for the 312 study, which enrolled 163 adult patients with NTM lung disease caused by MAC who completed six months of treatment in the CONVERT study, but did not demonstrate culture conversion by Month 6. The following data are interim results observed through December 2017, and have not been further analyzed. Patients in the ALIS plus GBT arm of the CONVERT study and patients in the GBT-only arm of the CONVERT study who did not achieve culture conversion by Month 6 had the option to enroll in the 312 study at Month 8. Under the study protocol, patients from both arms of the CONVERT study will receive 12 months of ALIS plus GBT in the 312 study. We will also use the data from this trial to further assess the impact of the addition of ALIS to background GBT on sputum culture conversion, by Month 6. As of December 2017, of the 163 patients enrolled in the 312 study, 124 patients were evaluable for culture conversion. Descriptive interim culture conversion data as of December 2017 for these 124 patients are detailed below. The interim culture conversion data has not been statistically analyzed. Number of Patients Completing Six Months of Treatment in the 312 study as of December 2017 ** Percent Achieving Sputum Culture Conversion by Month 6 in the 312 study Patients who received GBT only in the 212 study and crossed over to receive six months of treatment with ALIS + GBT (n=90) 67 28.4% (19/67) Patients who received ALIS + GBT in the 212 study and crossed over to continue treatment in the 312 study, to receive a combined total of 14 months of ALIS + GBT treatment in both studies (n=73) 57 12.3% (7/57) ** Includes all patients completing six months of treatment, all patients who discontinued prior to six months and for all ongoing patients prior to six months who completed two months of treatment. 312 Study Interim Safety and Tolerability Data We have not yet performed a final analysis of any safety data for the 312 study. However, based on an interim review of data available from the 312 study, we believe that STEAEs were similar to the STEAEs we reported in September 2017 as part of our top-line data results for the 212 study. As of December 2017, the overall dropout rate in the 312 study was 24% (n=39/163). 62 Table of Contents Further Research and Lifecycle Management for ALIS We are currently exploring and supporting research and lifecycle management programs for ALIS beyond refractory NTM lung infections caused by MAC. Specifically, we are evaluating future study designs focusing on the MAC disease treatment pathway, including front-line treatment and monotherapy maintenance to prevent recurrence (defined as true relapse or reinfection) of NTM lung disease. In addition, we are evaluating non-MAC NTM species, such as M. abscessus . If the data from the CONVERT study are sufficient to support our MAAs and regulatory bodies approve ALIS, such lifecycle management studies could enable us to reach more potential patients. These initiatives may include new clinical studies sponsored by us or investigator-initiated studies, which are clinical studies initiated and sponsored by physicians or research institutions with funding from us. INS1007 INS1007 is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of DPP1, which we in-licensed from AstraZeneca in October 2016. DPP1 is an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases in neutrophils when they are formed in the bone marrow. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and play an essential role in pathogen destruction and inflammatory mediation. Neutrophils contain the neutrophil serine proteases, neutrophil elastase, proteinase 3, and cathepsin G, that have been implicated in a variety of inflammatory diseases. In chronic inflammatory lung diseases, neutrophils accumulate in the airways and release active neutrophil serine proteases in excess that cause lung destruction and inflammation. INS1007 may decrease the damaging effects of inflammatory diseases, such as non-CF bronchiectasis, by inhibiting DPP1 and its activation of neutrophil serine proteases. Non-CF bronchiectasis is a progressive pulmonary disorder in which the bronchi become permanently dilated due to chronic inflammation and infection. Currently, there is no cure, and we are not aware of any FDA-approved therapies specifically indicated for non-CF bronchiectasis. The WILLOW Study The WILLOW study, a global phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multi-center clinical study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of INS1007 administered once daily for 24 weeks in subjects with non-CF bronchiectasis. We commenced enrollment in the WILLOW study in December 2017. In addition, we are exploring the potential of INS1007 in various neutrophil-driven inflammatory conditions. INS1009 INS1009 is an investigational sustained-release inhaled treprostinil prodrug nanoparticle formulation that has the potential to address certain of the current limitations of existing prostanoid therapies. We believe that INS1009 prolongs duration of effect and may provide PAH patients with greater consistency in pulmonary arterial pressure reduction over time. Current inhaled prostanoid therapies must be dosed four to nine times per day for the treatment of PAH. Reducing dose frequency has the potential to ease patient burden and improve compliance. Additionally, we believe that INS1009 may be associated with fewer side effects, including elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, and severity and/or frequency of cough, associated with high initial drug levels and local upper airway exposure when using current inhaled prostanoid therapies. We believe INS1009 may offer a differentiated product profile for rare pulmonary disorders, including PAH, and we are currently evaluating our options to advance its development, including exploring its use as an inhaled dry powder formulation. Other Development Activities Our earlier-stage pipeline includes preclinical compounds that we are evaluating in multiple rare diseases of unmet medical need, including methicillin-resistant staph aureus (MRSA) and NTM. To complement our internal research and development, we actively evaluate in-licensing and acquisition opportunities for a broad range of rare diseases. KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Research and Development (R&D) Expenses R&D expenses consist of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel serving in our research and development functions, including medical affairs. Expenses also include other internal operating expenses, the cost of manufacturing our drug candidate(s) for clinical study, the cost of conducting clinical studies, and the cost of conducting preclinical and research activities. In addition, our R&D expenses include payments to third parties for the license rights to products in development (prior to marketing approval), such as for INS1007. Our expenses related to 63 Table of Contents manufacturing our drug candidate(s) for clinical study are primarily related to activities at CMOs that manufacture our product candidates for our use, including purchases of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Our expenses related to clinical trials are primarily related to activities at contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. Since 2011, we have focused our development activities principally on our proprietary, advanced liposomal technology designed specifically for inhalation lung delivery. In 2015, we commenced the CONVERT study for ALIS for adult patients with treatment refractory NTM lung disease. In 2015, we also completed an open-label extension study in which CF patients that completed our phase 3 trial received ALIS for a period of two years. The majority of our research and development expenses have been for our ALIS development programs. Our development efforts in 2017 and 2016 principally related to the development of ALIS in the NTM lung disease indication described above. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for our non-employee directors and personnel serving in our executive, finance and accounting, legal, pre-commercial, corporate development, information technology, program management and human resource functions. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal services, including fees incurred in connection with the securities litigation filed against us and patent-related expenses, consulting services including for pre-commercial planning activities such as non-branded disease awareness, insurance, board of director fees, tax and accounting services. Investment Income and Interest Expense Investment income consists of interest and dividend income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense consists primarily of interest costs and amortization of debt issuance costs related to our debt obligations. Debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the term of the debt. Our balance sheet reflects debt, net of debt issuance costs paid to the lender and other third party costs. Unamortized debt issuance costs associated with extinguished debt are expensed in the period of the extinguishment. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 Net Loss Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $192.6 million , or $2.89 per common share basic and diluted, compared with a net loss of $176.3 million , or $2.85 per common share basic and diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2016 . The $16.4 million increase in our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was due to: Decreased R&D expenses of $13.0 million primarily resulting from the $30.0 million upfront payment for the license agreement entered into with AstraZeneca for exclusive global rights to INS1007 in October 2016, offset in part by, an increase in expenses related to the WILLOW study and higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in headcount; and Increased general and administrative expenses of $28.5 million resulting from an increase in pre-commercial planning activities, including external consulting expenses, and higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in headcount. In addition, there was a $2.4 million increase in interest expense resulting from the increase in our debt in the second half of 2016. R&D Expenses R&D expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were comprised of the following (in thousands): 64 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, Increase (decrease) 2017 2016 $ % External Expenses Clinical development and research $ 40,511 $ 35,890 $ 4,621 12.9% INS1007 license payment 30,000 (30,000 ) (100.0)% Manufacturing 19,808 17,313 2,495 14.4% Regulatory, quality assurance, and medical affairs 7,308 4,064 3,244 79.8% Subtotal external expenses $ 67,627 $ 87,267 $ (19,640 ) (22.5)% Internal Expenses Compensation and related expenses $ 34,180 $ 28,513 $ 5,667 19.9% Other internal operating expenses 7,942 6,941 1,001 14.4% Subtotal internal expenses $ 42,122 $ 35,454 $ 6,668 18.8% Total $ 109,749 $ 122,721 $ (12,972 ) (10.6)% R&D expenses decreased to $109.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 from $122.7 million in the same period in 2016 . The $13.0 million decrease was due to a $30.0 million upfront payment under the AZ License Agreement related to INS1007 in October 2016 and a $3.7 million decrease in expenses relating to INS1009. These decreases were partially offset by a $10.2 million increase in raw materials purchases and expenses related to the WILLOW trial for INS1007 and a $5.7 million increase in compensation and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount. There was also an increase of $3.2 million due to increased regulatory, quality assurance and medical affairs consulting expenses and medical grants. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were comprised of the following (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, Increase (decrease) 2017 2016 $ % General & administrative $ 46,249 $ 35,291 $ 10,958 31.1 % Pre-commercial expenses 32,922 15,388 17,534 113.9 % Total general & administrative expenses $ 79,171 $ 50,679 $ 28,492 56.2 % General and administrative expenses increased to $79.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 from $50.7 million in the same period in 2016 . The $28.5 million increase was primarily due to an increase of $12.8 million in consulting fees relating to pre-commercial planning activities, an increase of $7.7 million due to higher compensation costs related to an increase in headcount, and a one-time payment in October 2017 related to the buy-down of future royalties payable to PARI on the global net sales of ALIS, if approved. Interest Expense Interest expense was $5.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $3.5 million in the same period in 2016 . The $2.4 million increase in interest expense in 2017 relates primarily to an increase in our borrowings from Hercules in September and October of 2016. We entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (A&R Loan Agreement) with Hercules which increased our borrowing capacity by an additional $30.0 million to an aggregate total of $55.0 million. The increase in borrowings under the A&R Loan Agreement was used to fund the upfront payment owed under the AZ License Agreement for the exclusive global rights to INS1007. Income tax (benefit) provision The income tax (benefit) provision was $(0.3) million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The income tax (benefit) for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects the reversal of the valuation allowance related to alternative minimum tax (AMT) that we paid in 2009. As a result of the Tax Act, we recorded a noncurrent receivable to reflect the tax amount due to us in future periods relating to a refund due for the prior AMT paid. In addition, the income tax (benefit) provision for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 reflects current income tax expense recorded as a result of taxable income in certain of our subsidiaries in Europe. 65 Table of Contents On December 22, 2017 the Tax Act was signed into law. The Tax Act introduced significant changes to the Code. The Tax Act, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income in respect of losses arising in taxable years beginning after 2017 and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits (including reducing the business tax credit for certain clinical testing expenses incurred in the testing of certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions generally referred to as orphan drugs ). Our federal net operating loss carryovers for taxable years beginning after 2017 will be carried forward indefinitely pursuant to the Tax Act. Notwithstanding the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Act is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Tax Act did not have a material impact on our financial statements because our deferred temporary differences are fully offset by a valuation allowance and we do not have any significant offshore earnings from which to record the mandatory transition tax. However, given the significant complexity of the Tax Act, anticipated guidance from the US Treasury about implementing the Tax Act, and the potential for additional guidance from the SEC or the FASB related to the Tax Act, these estimates may be adjusted during the measurement period. We continue to examine the impact the Tax Act may have on our business. Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 Net Loss Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $176.3 million, or $2.85 per common share basic and diluted, compared with a net loss of $118.2 million, or $2.02 per common share basic and diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $58.1 million increase in our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was due to: Increased R&D expenses of $48.4 million primarily resulting from a $30.0 million upfront payment for the license agreement entered into with AstraZeneca for exclusive global rights to INS1007 in October 2016 (AZ License Agreement), an increase in clinical trial expenses related to the CONVERT study and higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in headcount; and Increased general and administrative expenses of $7.5 million resulting from an increase in pre-commercial planning activities, legal and consulting expenses and higher compensation and related expenses, including an increase in noncash stock-based compensation, related to an increase in headcount. In addition, there was a $2.1 million decrease in the income tax benefit resulting from the sale of a portion of our New Jersey State net operating losses (NOLs) under the State of New Jersey's Technology Business Tax Certificate Transfer Program (the Program) for cash of $2.0 million in 2015. R&D Expenses R&D expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were comprised of the following: Years Ended December 31, Increase (decrease) 2016 2015 $ % External Expenses Clinical development and research $ 35,890 $ 24,972 $ 10,918 43.7 % INS1007 license payment 30,000 30,000 nm Manufacturing 17,313 22,121 (4,808 ) (21.7 )% Regulatory, quality assurance, and medical affairs 4,064 4,173 (109 ) (2.6 )% Subtotal external expenses $ 87,267 $ 51,266 $ 36,001 70.2 % Internal Expenses Compensation and related expenses $ 28,513 $ 18,666 $ 9,847 52.8 % Other internal operating expenses 6,941 4,345 2,596 59.7 % Subtotal internal expenses $ 35,454 $ 23,011 $ 12,443 54.1 % Total $ 122,721 $ 74,277 $ 48,444 65.2 % 66 Table of Contents R&D expenses increased to $122.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 from $74.3 million in the same period in 2015. The $48.4 million increase was due to a $30.0 million upfront payment under the AZ License Agreement related to INS1007 in October 2016, a $10.9 million increase in external clinical development expenses primarily related to the CONVERT study and a $9.8 million increase in compensation and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount. These increases were partially offset by a $4.8 million decrease in manufacturing expenses primarily due to the completion of the build-out of our production area at Therapure's facility in 2015. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were comprised of the following (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, Increase (decrease) 2016 2015 $ % General & administrative $ 35,291 $ 30,614 $ 4,677 15.3 % Pre-commercial expenses 15,388 12,602 2,786 22.1 % Total general & administrative expenses $ 50,679 $ 43,216 $ 7,463 17.3 % General and administrative expenses increased to $50.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 from $43.2 million in the same period in 2015. The $7.5 million increase was primarily due to an increase of $3.7 million in consulting fees relating to pre-commercial planning activities, legal and consulting expenses and an increase of $3.7 million due to higher compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, related to an increase in headcount. Interest Expense Interest expense was $3.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $2.9 million in the same period in 2015. The $0.6 million increase in interest expense in 2016 relates primarily to an increase in our borrowings from Hercules in September and October of 2016. We entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (A&R Loan Agreement) with Hercules which increased our borrowing capacity by an additional $30.0 million to an aggregate total of $55.0 million. The increase in borrowings under the A&R Loan Agreement was used to fund the upfront payment owed under the AZ License Agreement for the exclusive global rights to INS1007. Income tax (benefit) provision The income tax (benefit) provision was $0.1 million and $(2.0) million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflects current income tax expense recorded as a result of taxable income in certain our subsidiaries in Europe. The income tax benefit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily reflects the reversal of a valuation allowance previously recorded against our New Jersey State NOLs that resulted from the sale of a portion of our New Jersey State NOLs under the Program for cash of $2.0 million, net of commissions. The Program allows qualified technology and biotechnology businesses in New Jersey to sell unused amounts of NOLs and defined research and development tax credits for cash. In 2015, we reached the lifetime maximum cap of NOLs that can be sold to the State of New Jersey. Therefore, we received no cash proceeds from the Program in 2016 and will not receive cash proceeds from the Program in the future. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview There is considerable time and cost associated with developing a potential drug or pharmaceutical product to the point of regulatory approval and commercialization. In recent years, we have funded our operations through public offerings of equity securities and debt financings. We expect to continue to incur losses both in our US and certain international entities, as we plan to fund research and development activities and commercial launch activities. We may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, to develop and commercialize ALIS if approved, to develop INS1007 and INS1009, and to develop, acquire, in-license or co-promote other products that address orphan or rare diseases. We believe we currently have sufficient funds to meet our financial needs for at least the next 12 months. We may opportunistically raise additional capital and may do so through equity or debt financing(s), strategic transactions or otherwise. We expect such additional funding, if any, would be used to continue to develop our potential product candidates, to pursue the 67 Table of Contents license or purchase of other technologies, to commercialize our product candidates or to purchase other products. During 2018, we plan to continue to fund further clinical development of ALIS and INS1007, support efforts to obtain regulatory approvals, and prepare for commercialization of ALIS. Our cash requirements in 2018 will be impacted by a number of factors, the most significant of which are expenses related to the CONVERT and 312 studies and pre-commercialization efforts for ALIS, and to a lesser extent, expenses related to INS1007 and future ALIS clinical trials. We expect our operating expenses in 2018 to increase significantly as compared to 2017. In January 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2025. We sold $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes, including the exercise in full of the underwriter's option to purchase additional Convertible Notes. Our net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of $14.2 million , were $435.8 million . In September 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 14,123,150 shares of our common stock, which included the underwriter exercise in full of its over-allotment option of 1,842,150 shares, at a price to the public of $28.50 per share. Our net proceeds from the sale of the shares, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses of $24.8 million , were $377.7 million . In April 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of 11,500,000 shares of our common stock, which included the underwriter's exercise in full of its over-allotment option of 1,500,000 shares, at a price to the public of $20.65 per share. Our net proceeds from the sale of the shares, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses of $14.5 million , were $222.9 million . Cash Flows As of December 31, 2017 , we had total cash and cash equivalents of $381.2 million , as compared with $162.6 million as of December 31, 2016 . The $218.6 million increase was due to the cash provided by financing activities in excess of our operating activities. Our working capital was $344.8 million as of December 31, 2017 as compared with $140.4 million as of December 31, 2016 . Net cash used in operating activities was $159.6 million and $146.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The net cash used in operating activities during 2017 and 2016 was primarily for the clinical, regulatory, manufacturing and pre-commercial activities related to ALIS, including in 2017 the exercise of an option to buy-down the future royalties payable to PARI. In 2017, there were increases in raw materials purchases and expenses related to the WILLOW study for INS1007. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we made a payment of $30.0 million to AstraZeneca under the AZ License Agreement for INS1007. Net cash used in investing activities was $3.0 million and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The net cash used in investing activities during 2017 was primarily related to the investment in our long-term production capacity build-out at Patheon and for the build out of our lab facility in Bridgewater, New Jersey. Net cash used in investing activities during 2016 was primarily related to payments for the build out of our headquarters and lab facility in Bridgewater, New Jersey. Net cash provided by financing activities was $381.1 million and $30.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2017 included net cash proceeds of $377.7 million from our issuance of 14.1 million shares of common stock in September 2017 and cash proceeds received from stock option exercises. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily net cash proceeds from the issuance of debt. Contractual Obligations On June 29, 2012, we and our domestic subsidiaries, as co-borrowers, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. (as subsequently amended, the Prior Loan Agreement) under which we borrowed an aggregate of $25.0 million at an interest rate of 9.25%. We paid an "end of term" charge of $390,000 in January 2016, which was charged to interest expense (and accreted to the debt) using the effective interest method over the life of the Prior Loan Agreement. On September 30, 2016, we and our domestic subsidiaries, as co-borrowers, entered into the A&R Loan Agreement with Hercules. The A&R Loan Agreement included a total commitment from Hercules of up to $55.0 million, of which $25.0 million was previously outstanding. The amount of borrowings was initially increased by $10.0 million to an aggregate total of $35.0 million on September 30, 2016. An additional $20.0 million was available at our option through June 30, 2017 subject to certain conditions, including the payment of a facility fee of 0.375%. We exercised this option in early October 2016 and borrowed an additional $20.0 million in connection with the upfront payment obligation under the AZ License Agreement. 68 Table of Contents The interest rate for the term is floating and is defined as the greater of (i) 9.25% or (ii) 9.25% plus the sum of the US prime rate minus 4.50%, along with a backend fee of 4.15% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding and an aggregate facility fee of $337,500. The interest-only period extends through November 1, 2018, but can be extended up to six months under certain conditions. The maturity date of the loan facility was also extended to October 1, 2020. In connection with the Company generating and announcing top-line data from the CONVERT study on September 5, 2017 that supports the filing of an NDA, along with the completion of the equity financing, the interest-only period was automatically extended through May 1, 2019 and the requirement to have a consolidated minimum cash liquidity in an amount no less than $25.0 million was eliminated. In connection with the A&R Loan Agreement, we granted Hercules a first position lien on all of our assets, excluding intellectual property. Prepayment of the loans made pursuant to the A&R Loan Agreement is subject to penalty. The backend fee of 4.15% on the aggregate outstanding principal balance will be charged to interest expense (and accreted to the debt) using the effective interest method over the original life of the A&R Loan Agreement. Debt issuance fees paid to the lender were recorded as a discount on the debt and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the A&R Loan Agreement. In February 2018, we notified Hercules that we will repay the A&R Loan Agreement in full on February 28, 2018. The total aggregate cash payable to Hercules for the early prepayment of debt, inclusive of accrued interest, the backend fee and an early payment penalty will be approximately $58.0 million. We have an operating lease for office and laboratory space located in Bridgewater, NJ, our corporate headquarters, for which the initial lease term expires in November 2019. Future minimum rental payments under this lease total approximately $2.0 million. In July 2016, we signed an operating lease for additional laboratory space located in Bridgewater, NJ for which the initial lease term expires in September 2021. Future minimum rental payments under this lease are $1.9 million. In September 2015, we entered into a Commercial Fill/Finish Services Agreement (the Fill/Finish Agreement) with Althea, for Althea to produce, on a non-exclusive basis, ALIS in finished dosage form at a 50 kg scale. Under the Fill/Finish Agreement, we are obligated to pay a minimum of $2.7 million for the batches of ALIS produced each calendar year during the term of the Fill/Finish Agreement. The Fill/Finish Agreement was effective as of January 1, 2015, and had an initial term that was to end on December 31, 2017. In 2016, we signed an extension of the agreement through December 31, 2019 and it may be extended for additional two-year periods upon mutual written agreement of the Company and Althea at least one year prior to the expiration of its then-current term. As of December 31, 2017 , future payments under our long-term debt agreements, minimum future payments under non-cancellable operating leases and minimum future payment obligations are as follows: As of December 31, 2017 Payments Due By Period Total Less than 1 year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Debt obligations Debt maturities $ 55,000 $ $ 55,000 $ $ Contractual interest 14,871 5,158 9,713 Operating leases 3,917 1,521 1,898 498 Purchase obligations 5,400 2,700 2,700 Total contractual obligations $ 79,188 $ 9,379 $ 69,311 $ 498 $ This table does not include: (a) any milestone payments which may become payable to third parties under our license and collaboration agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known; (b) any royalty payments to third parties as the amounts of such payments, timing and/or the likelihood of such payments are not known; (c) contracts that are entered into in the ordinary course of business which are not material in the aggregate in any period presented above; (d) the January 2018 underwritten public offering of 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2025 in the aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million ; or (e) any payments related to the agreements mentioned below. We currently have a licensing agreement with PARI for the use of the optimized eFlow Nebulizer System for delivery of ALIS in treating patients with NTM lung infections, CF and bronchiectasis. Under the licensing agreement, we have rights under several US and foreign issued patents, and patent applications involving improvements to the optimized eFlow Nebulizer System, to exploit such system with ALIS for the treatment of such indications, but we cannot manufacture such 69 Table of Contents nebulizers except as permitted under our Commercialization Agreement with PARI. Under the licensing agreement, we paid PARI an upfront license fee and PARI is entitled to receive milestone payments up to an aggregate of 4.3 million either in cash, qualified stock or a combination of both, at PARI's discretion, based on achievement of certain future milestone events including, first acceptance of MAA submission (or equivalent) in the US of ALIS and the device, first receipt of marketing approval in the US for ALIS and the device, and first receipt of marketing approval in a major EU country for ALIS and the device. In addition, PARI is entitled to receive royalty payments in the mid-single digits on the annual global net sales of ALIS pursuant to the licensing agreement, subject to certain specified annual minimum royalties. In October 2017, we exercised an option to buy-down the future royalties that will be payable to PARI. The payment to PARI was included as a component of general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017. In July 2014, we entered into a Commercialization Agreement with PARI for the manufacture and supply of eFlow nebulizer systems and related accessories (the Device) as optimized for use with ALIS. Under the Commercialization Agreement, PARI manufactures the Device except in the case of certain defined supply failures, when the Company will have the right to make the Device and have it made by third parties (but not certain third parties deemed under the Commercialization Agreement to compete with PARI). The Commercialization Agreement has an initial term of 15 years from the first commercial sale of ALIS pursuant to the licensing agreement (the Initial Term). The term of the Commercialization Agreement may be extended by us for an additional five years by providing written notice to PARI at least one year prior to the expiration of the Initial Term. In October 2017, we entered into certain agreements with Patheon related to increasing our long-term production capacity for ALIS commercial inventory. The agreements provide for Patheon to manufacture and supply ALIS for our anticipated commercial needs. Under these agreements, we are required to deliver to Patheon the required raw materials, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, and certain fixed assets needed to manufacture ALIS. Patheon's supply obligations will commence once certain technology transfer and construction services are completed. Our manufacturing and supply agreement with Patheon will remain in effect for a fixed initial term, after which it will continue for successive renewal terms unless either we or Patheon have given written notice of termination. The technology transfer agreement will expire when the parties agree that the technology transfer services have been completed. The agreements may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including by either party due to a material uncured breach of the other party or the other party insolvency. These early termination clauses may reduce the amounts due to the relevant parties. The investment in our long-term production capacity build-out, including under the Patheon agreements and related agreements or purchase orders with third parties for raw materials and fixed assets, is estimated to be approximately $60.0 million and will be incurred over the next three to four years. In October 2016, we entered into the AZ License Agreement, pursuant to which AstraZeneca granted us exclusive global rights for the purpose of developing and commercializing AZD7986 (which we renamed INS1007). In consideration of the licenses and other rights granted by AstraZeneca, we made an upfront payment of $30.0 million, which was included as research and development expense in the fourth quarter of 2016. We are obligated to make a series of contingent milestone payments to AstraZeneca totaling up to an additional $85.0 million upon the achievement of clinical development and regulatory filing milestones. If we elect to develop INS1007 for a second indication, we will be obligated to make an additional series of contingent milestone payments totaling up to $42.5 million. We are not obligated to make any additional milestone payments for any additional indications. In addition, we have agreed to pay AstraZeneca tiered royalties ranging from a high single-digit to mid-teen on net sales of any approved product based on INS1007 and one additional payment of $35.0 million upon the first achievement of $1 billion in annual net sales. The AZ License Agreement provides AstraZeneca with the option to negotiate a future agreement with us for commercialization of INS1007 in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma. In December 2014, we entered into a services agreement with SynteractHCR, Inc. (Synteract) pursuant to which we retained Synteract to perform implementation and management services in connection with the 212 study. We anticipate that aggregate costs relating to all work orders for the 212 study will be approximately $45 million over the period of the study. In April 2015, we entered into a work order with Synteract to perform implementation and management services for the 312 study. We anticipate that aggregate costs relating to all work orders for the 312 study will be approximately $25 million over the period of the study. In February 2014, we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with Therapure for the manufacture of ALIS at a 200 kg scale. Pursuant to the agreement, we collaborated with Therapure to construct a production area for the manufacture of ALIS in Therapure's existing manufacturing facility in Canada. Therapure manufactures ALIS for us on a non-exclusive basis. The agreement has an initial term of five years from the first date on which Therapure delivers ALIS to us after we obtain permits related to the manufacture of ALIS, and will renew automatically for successive periods of two years each, unless terminated by either party by providing the required two years' prior written notice to the other party. Under the agreement, we are obligated to pay certain minimum amounts for the batches of ALIS produced each calendar year. 70 Table of Contents In 2004 and 2009, we entered into research funding agreements with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc. (CFFT) whereby we received $1.7 million and $2.2 million for each respective agreement in research funding for the development of ALIS. If ALIS becomes an approved product for patients with CF in the US, we will owe a payment to CFFT of up to $13.4 million that is payable over a three-year period after approval as a commercialized drug in the US. Furthermore, if certain global sales milestones are met within five years of the drug's commercialization, we would owe an additional payment of $3.9 million. Since there is significant development and regulatory risk associated with ALIS, including with respect to the CF indication, we have not accrued these obligations. Future Funding Requirements To date, we have not generated material revenue from ALIS, and we do not know when, or if, we will generate such revenue. We do not expect to generate such revenue unless or until we obtain marketing approval of, secure reimbursement for, and commercialize, ALIS. We may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, to develop and commercialize ALIS, to develop INS1007 and INS1009, and to develop, acquire, in-license or co-promote other products that address orphan or rare diseases. Our future capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors, including: the timing and cost of our anticipated clinical trials of ALIS for the treatment of patients with NTM lung infections; the decisions of the FDA, MHLW, PMDA and EMA with respect to our applications for marketing approval of ALIS in the US, Japan and Europe; the costs of activities related to the regulatory approval process; and the timing of approvals, if received; the cost of putting in place the sales and marketing capabilities necessary to be prepared for a potential commercial launch of ALIS, if approved; the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing patent claims; the timing and cost of our anticipated clinical trials, including INS1007 and the related milestone payments due to AstraZeneca; the costs of our manufacturing-related activities; the costs associated with commercializing ALIS, if we receive marketing approval; and subject to receipt of marketing approval, the levels, timing and collection of revenue received from sales of approved products, if any, in the future. In April 2015, we generated net proceeds of $222.9 million from the issuance of 11.5 million shares of common stock. In September 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 14,123,150 shares of our common stock, which included the underwriter exercise in full of its over-allotment option of 1,842,150 shares, at a price to the public of $28.50 per share. Our net proceeds from the sale of the shares, after deducting the underwriter discount and offering expenses of $24.8 million , were $377.7 million . In January 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2025. We sold $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes, including the exercise in full of the underwriters' option to purchase additional Convertible Notes. Our net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of $14.2 million , were approximately $435.8 million . The Convertible Notes bear interest payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2018. We believe that we have sufficient capital resources to support scheduled interest payments on this debt. On September 30, 2016, the total committed amount under the A&R Loan Agreement with Hercules was increased to $55.0 million, $25.0 million of which was previously outstanding. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we drew down the remaining commitment. In February 2018, we notified Hercules that we will repay the A&R Loan Agreement in full on February 28, 2018. We believe we currently have sufficient funds to meet our financial needs for at least the next 12 months. However, our business strategy may require us to raise additional capital at any time through equity or debt financing(s), strategic transactions or otherwise. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, other than operating leases, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. We do not have any interest in special purpose entities, structured finance entities or other variable interest entities. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the US requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported in our consolidated balance sheets and the amounts of revenue reported in our consolidated statements of 71 Table of Contents comprehensive loss are affected by estimates and assumptions, which are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for research and development, stock-based compensation, identifiable intangible assets, and accrued expenses. The accounting policies discussed below are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. Actual results could differ from our estimates. For additional accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel serving our research and development functions, and other internal operating expenses, the cost of manufacturing our drug candidate for clinical study, including the medical devices for drug delivery, the cost of conducting clinical studies, and the cost of conducting preclinical and research activities. In addition, research and development expenses include payments to third parties for the license rights to products in development (prior to marketing approval). Our expenses related to manufacturing our drug candidate and medical devices for clinical study are primarily related to activities at CMOs that manufacture ALIS, and to a lesser extent, our other clinical product requirements. Our expenses related to clinical trials are primarily related to activities at CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. These contracts set forth the scope of work to be completed at a fixed fee or amount per patient enrolled. Payments under these contracts depend on performance criteria such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones as well as time-based fees. Expenses are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and to activity according to the clinical trial protocol. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized. Such amounts are then recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed, or when the goods or services are no longer expected to be provided. Stock-Based Compensation We recognize stock-based compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees and directors based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. The grant-date fair value of the award is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period, which generally equals the vesting period of the award, and if applicable, is adjusted for expected forfeitures. We also grant performance-based stock options to employees. The grant-date fair value of the performance-based stock options is recognized as compensation expense over the implicit service period using the accelerated attribution method once it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. Stock-based compensation expense is included in both research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. The following table summarizes the assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 : 2017 2016 2015 Volatility 71% - 79% 74% - 77% 78% - 82% Risk-free interest rate 1.73% - 2.13% 1.00% - 1.90% 1.31% - 1.75% Dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Expected option term (in years) 6.25 6.25 6.25 For the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the volatility factor was based on our historical volatility during the expected term or since the closing of our merger with Transave, Inc. in December 2010. The risk-free interest rate is based on the US Treasury yield in effect at the date of grant. Estimated forfeitures were based on the actual percentage of option forfeitures since the closing of the Company merger with Transave, Inc. in December 2010 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2017 , estimated forfeitures were based on the actual percentage of option forfeitures over the expected option term. Identifiable Intangible Assets Identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values and are not amortized until commercialization. Once commercialization occurs, these intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives. The fair values assigned to our intangible assets are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur that may require us to review the assets for impairment. Events or circumstances that may require an impairment assessment include negative clinical trial results, the non-approval of a new drug application by a regulatory agency, material delays in our development program or a sustained decline in market capitalization. 72 Table of Contents Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to periodic amortization. Rather, indefinite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment by applying a fair value based test on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. Events or circumstances that may require an interim impairment assessment are consistent with those described above. We perform our annual impairment test as of October 1 of each year. We use the income approach to derive the fair value of in-process research and development assets. This approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. A market based valuation approach was not considered given a lack of revenues and profits by us. This approach requires significant management judgment with respect to unobservable inputs such as future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, appropriate discount rates and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with our business plans. Accrued Expenses We are required to estimate accrued expenses as part of our process of preparing financial statements. This process involves estimating the level of service performed on our behalf and the associated cost incurred in instances where we have not been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. Examples of areas in which subjective judgments may be required include costs associated with services provided by contract organizations for preclinical development, clinical trials and manufacturing of clinical materials. We accrue for expenses associated with these external services by determining the total cost of a given study based on the terms of the related contract. We accrue for costs incurred as the services are being provided by monitoring the status of the trials and the invoices received from our external service providers. In the case of clinical trials, the estimated cost normally relates to the projected costs of having subjects enrolled in our trials, which we recognize over the estimated term of the trial according to the number of subjects enrolled in the trial on an ongoing basis, beginning with subject enrollment. As actual costs become known to us, we adjust our accruals. To date, the number of clinical trials and related research service agreements has been relatively limited and our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred. New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern and, if so, provide certain footnote disclosures. This ASU was effective for the annual period ended December 31, 2016, and interim reporting periods thereafter. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements and related footnote disclosures. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which updated and simplified the presentation of deferred income taxes. Current generally accepted accounting principles require an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application was permitted and we adopted the update effective with our annual reporting period ended December 31, 2015. The adoption of this update did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-9, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation. ASU 2016-9 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-9 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2016-9 in the first quarter of 2017. The impact of the adoption was not material to the consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for annual reporting periods beginning 73 Table of Contents after December 15, 2017. We will adopt ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018 and the impact of adoption will not be material to our consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (including interim periods within those periods) using a modified retrospective approach and early adoption is permitted. We expect to adopt ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019 and are in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.
