Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The discussion in this Item 7 should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The discussion in this Item 7 contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's plans, estimates and beliefs. The Company's actual results could materially differ from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. Overview The Company is an omnichannel retail organization operating stores, websites and mobile applications under three brands (Macy's, Bloomingdale's and bluemercury) that sell a wide range of merchandise, including apparel and accessories (men's, women's and children's), cosmetics, home furnishings and other consumer goods. The Company operates approximately 850 stores in 44 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. As of February 3, 2018 , the Company's operations were conducted through Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Bloomingdale The Outlet, Macy Backstage, bluemercury and Macy China Limited which are aggregated into one reporting segment in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 280, Segment Reporting. The Company continues to implement its North Star strategy to transform its omnichannel business and focus on key growth areas, embrace customer centricity, and optimize value in its real estate portfolio. Inspired by the North Star, there are five points to this strategy. 1. From Familiar to Favorite includes everything the Company does to further its brand awareness and identity to its core customers. Actions include understanding and anticipating customers needs, strengthening the Company's fashion authority and executing initiatives around its loyalty and pricing strategies. It celebrates the Company's iconic events and includes strategies to appeal to more value-oriented customers. 2. It Must Be Macy encompasses delivering the products and experiences customers love and are exclusive to the Company. This includes styles and home fashion for every day and special occasions, from the Company's leading private brands, as well as exclusive national brands or assortments. 3. Every Experience Matters , in-store and online. The Company's competitive advantage is the ability to combine the human touch in its physical stores with cutting-edge technology in its mobile applications and websites. Key to this point is the enhancement of a customer's experience as they explore our stores, mobile applications and websites, find their favorite styles, sizes and colors, and receive their purchases through the shopping channels they prefer. 4. Funding our Future represents the decisions and actions the Company takes to identify and realize resources to fuel growth. This involves a focus on cost reduction and reinvestment as well as creating value from the Company's real estate portfolio. 5. What New, What Next explores and develops innovations to turn consumer and technology trends to the Company's advantage and to drive growth. This includes exploring previously unmet customer needs and making smart investment decisions based on customer insights and analytics. The Company has taken a number of key steps over the past couple of years to position itself to successfully implement the North Star strategy. In 2017, the Company continued its investment in technology, reengineered its merchandising and marketing structure, improved its curation of merchandise and expanded different Company initiatives to stores throughout its portfolio. The Company also launched a new Macy's Star Rewards loyalty program in October 2017 that focused on strengthening relationships with the Company's best customers, migrating existing customers to higher spending levels and attracting new or infrequent customers. The initial launch of the rewards program focused on proprietary cardholders with additional enhancements and expansion beyond proprietary cardholders planned for the future. In August 2017, the Company announced a restructuring which included the consolidation of three functions (merchandising, planning and private brands) into a single merchandising function. During the third quarter of 2017, the Company recognized $33 million of costs primarily associated with this restructuring effort as well as a restructuring within the marketing function. Additional financial and operational impacts of such restructuring actions are expected to include future annual savings of approximately $38 million, all of which may be used for reinvestment in the business in 2018. 18 In January 2018, the Company announced actions to continue improvements in organizational efficiency and to allocate resources to support its growth strategy. Major components of these restructuring activities included staffing adjustments across the stores organization with reductions in some stores and increases in others, further streamlining of some non-store functions and the closure of 11 stores in early 2018. In 2017, the Company continued to execute on its real estate strategy through both monetization and redevelopment of certain assets: Overall, the Company had asset sale gains of $544 million, totaling $411 million in cash proceeds, in 2017. These gains and proceeds include the sale of its store and parking facility in downtown Minneapolis, the sale of an additional two floors of the downtown Seattle Macy's store (four floors were sold in a similar transaction in fiscal 2015) and additional gains and proceeds from Macy's Brooklyn transaction executed in 2015. In addition, the gains recognized in 2017 include those related to the 2016 sale of the Company's Union Square Men's store in San Francisco. In 2016, the Company finalized the formation of a strategic alliance with Brookfield Asset Management ("Brookfield"), a leading global alternative asset manager, to create increased value in its real estate portfolio. Under the alliance, Brookfield has an exclusive right for up to 24 months to create a "pre-development plan" for each of approximately 50 Macy real estate assets, with an option for Macy to continue to identify and add assets into the alliance. Currently, the Company expects approximately two-thirds of these real estate assets to have potential for redevelopment. In February 2018, the Company announced that it had agreed to allow Brookfield to redevelop nine of these assets once it has received the necessary approvals. Upon the completion of approval and entitlements, Macy will either sell its interests in the individual assets to Brookfield or contribute them into individual joint ventures. If sold, the cumulative value of the nine properties is estimated to be approximately $50 million plus a retained participation in the upside profits of the three largest assets. In February 2018, the Company signed an agreement to sell the upper seven floors of its State Street store in Chicago to a private real estate fund sponsored by Brookfield. The Company expects to receive a total of $30 million upfront for the transaction, which includes a $3 million contribution towards redevelopment costs for migrating operations to the floors the Company will continue to own. In addition, the Company will receive a percentage of profit earned over and above a threshold internal rate of return. In 2017, the Company opened new Macy stores in Murray, UT and Los Angeles, CA as well as a Bloomingdale store in Kuwait under a license agreement with Al Tayer Group, LLC. The Company expects to open two additional Bloomingdale's stores in San Jose, CA and Norwalk, CT in fiscal 2019. Both Macy's off-price business, Macy's Backstage, and its clearance strategy, Last Act, have been successful in providing unique value opportunities to both existing and new Macy's customers. The Company has rolled out Last Act to all families of business and is currently focused on opening new Macy's Backstage stores within existing Macy's store locations. As of February 3, 2018, the Company has a total of 52 Macy's Backstage locations (7 freestanding and 45 inside Macy's stores). The Company is focused on accelerating the growth of its luxury beauty products and spa retailer, bluemercury, by opening additional freestanding bluemercury stores in urban and suburban markets, enhancing its online capabilities and adding bluemercury products and boutiques to Macy's stores. As of February 3, 2018, the Company is operating 157 bluemercury locations (137 freestanding and 20 inside Macy's stores). In August 2015, the Company established a joint venture, Macy's China Limited, of which the Company holds a sixty-five percent ownership interest and Hong Kong-based Fung Retailing Limited holds the remaining thirty-five percent ownership interest. Macy's China Limited began selling merchandise in China in the fourth quarter of 2015 through an e-commerce presence on Alibaba Group's Tmall Global. The Company's reporting includes the financial operations of Macy's China Limited, with the thirty-five percent ownership reported as a noncontrolling interest. 19 2017 Overview 2017 saw the implementation of the Company's North Star strategy and included the roll-outs of different initiatives that had been tested by the Company on a smaller scale. 2017 ended with a strong fourth quarter and selected results of 2017 include: Net sales, which include a 53rd week of operations, decreased 3.7% compared to 2016. Comparable sales on an owned basis decreased 2.2% and comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis decreased 1.9%. Operating income for 2017 was $1,807 million or 7.3% of sales; while operating income, excluding restructuring, impairment, store closing and other costs and settlement charges, was $2,098 million or 8.4% of sales. Federal, state, and local income tax benefit for 2017 was $29 million compared to expense of $341 million in 2016, due to U.S. federal tax reform which led to a non-cash tax benefit of $571 million associated with the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax balances. Net income attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders for 2017 was $1,547 million , an increase of $928 million from $619 million in 2016. Diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders increased to $5.04 in 2017 compared to $1.99 in 2016. Diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders, excluding certain items, increased to $3.77 in 2017 from $3.11 in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring, impairment, store closing and other costs and settlement charges) as a percent to net sales was 12.4% in 2017, as compared to 11.4% in 2016. Return on invested capital ("ROIC"), a key measure of operating productivity, was 20.8% for 2017. The Company repurchased or repaid approximately $950 million of debt in 2017, consisting of $247 million of debt repurchased in the open market, $300 million of a debt maturity and $400 million of debt repurchased in a tender offer ("tender offer"). See pages 29 to 32 for reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures presented above to the most comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") financial measures and other important information. 20 Results of Operations 2017 2016 2015 Amount % to Sales Amount % to Sales Amount % to Sales (dollars in millions, except per share figures) Net sales $ 24,837 $ 25,778 $ 27,079 Decrease in sales (3.7 ) % (4.8 ) % (3.7 ) % Decrease in comparable sales (2.2 ) % (3.5 ) % (3.0 ) % Cost of sales (15,152 ) (61.0 ) % (15,621 ) (60.6 ) % (16,496 ) (60.9 ) % Gross margin 9,685 39.0 % 10,157 39.4 % 10,583 39.1 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (8,131 ) (32.8 ) % (8,474 ) (32.8 ) % (8,468 ) (31.3 ) % Gains on sale of real estate 544 2.2 % 209 0.8 % 212 0.8 % Restructuring, impairment, store closing and other costs (186 ) (0.7 ) % (479 ) (1.9 ) % (288 ) (1.1 ) % Settlement charges (105 ) (0.4 ) % (98 ) (0.4 ) % % Operating income 1,807 7.3 % 1,315 5.1 % 2,039 7.5 % Interest expense - net (310 ) (363 ) (361 ) Net premiums on early retirement of debt 10 Income before income taxes 1,507 952 1,678 Federal, state and local income tax benefit (expense) 29 (341 ) (608 ) Net income 1,536 611 1,070 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest 11 8 2 Net income attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders $ 1,547 6.2 % $ 619 2.4 % $ 1,072 4.0 % Diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders $ 5.04 $ 1.99 $ 3.22 Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures Decrease in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis (1.9 ) % (2.9 ) % (2.5 ) % Operating income, excluding certain items $ 2,098 8.4 % $ 1,892 7.3 % $ 2,327 8.6 % Diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders, excluding certain items $ 3.77 $ 3.11 $ 3.77 Adjusted EBITDA as a percent to net sales 12.4 % 11.4 % 12.5 % ROIC 20.8 % 18.5 % 20.1 % See pages 29 to 32 for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measure and for other important information. Store information (at year-end) : Stores operated 852 829 868 Square footage (in millions) 127.7 130.2 141.9 21 Comparison of 2017 and 2016 Net Sales Net sales for 2017 include a 53rd week of operations and were $24,837 million, a decrease of $941 million , or 3.7% , from 2016 . The decrease in comparable sales on an owned basis, which exclude the 53rd week of sales, for 2017 was 2.2% compared to 2016 . The decrease in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis for 2017 was 1.9% compared to 2016 . (See page 30 for information regarding the Company's calculation of comparable sales, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure which takes into account sales of departments licensed to third parties to the most comparable GAAP measure and other important information). Although net sales were down compared to 2016, the Company experienced a strong fourth quarter in 2017 with comparable sales on an owned basis up 1.3% and up 1.4% on an owned plus licensed basis. Geographically, sales in 2017 were strongest in Florida, Eastern Texas, Louisiana, Hawaii, Oregon, Southern California and Arizona. Digital sales continued to be strong in 2017 and experienced double digit growth. By family of business, sales in 2017 were strongest in active apparel, fine jewelry, fragrances, dresses and men's tailored clothing. Sales in 2017 were less strong in handbags although the trend improved in the second half of the year. Sales of the Company's private label brands represented approximately 20% of net sales in the Macy's-branded operations in 2017 and 2016. Cost of Sales and Gross Margin Cost of sales for 2017 decreased $469 million from 2016 . The cost of sales rate as a percent to net sales of 61.0% was 40 basis points higher in 2017 , as compared to 60.6% in 2016 , primarily due to higher delivery expenses associated with the Company's omnichannel activities and free shipping promotions. Gross margin improved in the second half of 2017 as the Company benefited from its inventory management strategies. SG&A Expenses SG&A expenses for 2017 decreased $343 million from 2016 and the SG&A rate as a percent to net sales of 32.8% approximated the rate in 2016. The dollar decrease from 2016 was mainly due to store closings and the restructuring activities announced by the Company in 2016 and 2017, offset slightly by higher expenses associated with the continued investments in the Company's omnichannel operations, and investments in bluemercury and Macy's Backstage. The decrease was also driven by higher income from credit operations. Income from credit operations was $768 million in 2017 as compared to $736 million in 2016. Advertising expense, net of cooperative advertising allowances, was $1,108 million for 2017 compared to $1,153 million for 2016. Gains on Sale of Real Estate The Company recognized gains of $544 million in 2017 associated with sales of real estate, as compared to $209 million in 2016. 2017 included gains of $234 million related to the Macy's Union Square location, $71 million related to the Macy's Brooklyn transaction, $47 million related to the downtown Minneapolis properties and $40 million related to the downtown Seattle Macy's location. 2016 included $33 million of gains related to the Macy's Brooklyn transaction. Restructuring, Impairment, Store Closing and Other Costs Restructuring, impairment, store closing and other costs for 2017 includes costs and expenses primarily associated with the organizational changes and store closings announced in August 2017 and January 2018. In 2017, these costs included $120 million of severance and other human resource-related costs primarily associated with organization changes and store closings, $53 million of asset impairment charges and $13 million of other related costs and expenses. Restructuring, impairment, store closing and other costs for 2016 includes costs and expenses primarily associated with the organizational changes and store closings announced in August 2016 and January 2017. During 2016 , these costs and expenses included asset impairment charges of $265 million, $168 million of severance and other human resource-related costs and $46 million of other related costs and expenses. Settlement Charges $105 million and $98 million of non-cash settlement charges were recognized in 2017 and 2016, respectively. These charges relate to the pro-rata recognition of net actuarial losses associated with the Company defined benefit retirement plans and are the result of an increase in lump sum distributions associated with store closings, a voluntary separation program, organizational restructuring, and periodic distribution activity. Net Interest Expense and Net Premiums on the Early Retirement of Debt Net interest expense, excluding net premiums on the early retirement of debt, for 2017 decreased $53 million from 2016 . This decrease was primarily driven by the early repayment of $647 million of debt and the maturity of $300 million 22 of debt in 2017. This early repayment resulted in the recognition of a $10 million benefit related to the write-off of the premium associated with the debt repayments, net of the premium costs and other expenses incurred with the early repayment. This benefit is presented as a net premium on the early retirement of debt on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Effective Tax Rate The Company's effective tax rate was a benefit of 1.9% for 2017 and expense of 35.8% for 2016 . 2017 differs from the federal income tax statutory rate of 33.7%, and on a comparative basis, principally due to 2017 U.S. federal tax reform that led to the recognition of a non-cash tax benefit of $571 million associated with the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax balances. Further, 2017 included the recognition of approximately $15 million of net tax deficiencies associated with share-based payment awards due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. Historically, the Company had recognized such amounts as an offset to accumulated excess tax benefits previously recognized in additional paid-in capital. Net Income Attributable to Macy's, Inc. Shareholders Net income attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders for 2017 increased compared to 2016 , driven by higher operating income due to higher asset sale gains, lower selling, general and administrative expenses, restructuring, impairment, store closing and other costs, partially offset by lower sales and gross margin. Coupled with lower net interest expense and a net income tax benefit resulted in net income attributable to Macy's Inc. shareholders increasing by $928 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. Comparison of 2016 and 2015 Net Sales Net sales for 2016 decreased $1,301 million or 4.8% compared to 2015 . The decrease in comparable sales on an owned basis for 2016 was 3.5% compared to 2015 . The decrease in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis for 2016 was 2.9% compared to 2015 . (See page 30 for information regarding the Company's calculation of comparable sales, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure which takes into account sales of departments licensed to third parties to the most comparable GAAP measure and other important information). The Company experienced an overall weakness in sales, but geographically sales in 2016 were strongest in the Southwest, particularly southern California. Digital sales continued to be strong in 2016 and experienced double digit growth. By family of business, sales in 2016 were strongest in apparel, fine jewelry, shoes, intimate apparel and fragrances. Sales in 2016 were less strong in fashion jewelry, handbags, and fashion watches. Sales of the Company's private label brands represented approximately 20% of net sales in the Macy's-branded operations in 2016 and 2015. Cost of Sales and Gross Margin Cost of sales for 2016 decreased $875 million from 2015 . The cost of sales rate as a percent to net sales of 60.6% was 30 basis points lower in 2016 , as compared to 60.9% in 2015 , primarily due to fewer markdowns taken in 2016 as compared to 2015 and offset slightly by higher delivery expenses associated with the Company's omnichannel activities and free shipping promotions. SG&A Expenses SG&A expenses for 2016 increased $6 million from 2015 , however the SG&A rate as a percent to net sales of 32.8% was 150 basis points higher in 2016 , as compared to 2015 . SG&A expenses in 2016 were impacted by lower income from credit operations and higher expenses associated with the continued investments in the Company's omnichannel operations, investments in bluemercury, Macy's Backstage and Macy's China Limited. These increases were partially offset by lower retirement expenses (including Pension Plan, SERP and defined contribution plan expenses), lower advertising expense, net of cooperative advertising allowances and the impact of the restructuring announced at the end of 2015. Income from credit operations was $736 million in 2016 as compared to $831 million in 2015. Retirement expenses were $44 million in 2016 as compared to $77 million in 2015. Advertising expense, net of cooperative advertising allowances, was $1,153 million for 2016 compared to $1,173 million for 2015. Advertising expense, net of cooperative advertising allowances, as a percent to net sales was 4.5% for 2016 and 4.3% for 2015. 23 Gains on Sale of Real Estate Gains on sale of real estate decreased $3 million to $209 million in 2016 compared to $212 million in 2015. 2016 and 2015 included $33 million and $84 million, respectively, of gains related to the Macy's Brooklyn transaction. 2015 also included a $57 million gain related to the sale of a portion of the downtown Macy's Seattle location. Restructuring, Impairment, Store Closing and Other Costs Restructuring, impairment, store closing and other costs for 2016 includes costs and expenses primarily associated with the organizational changes and store closings announced in August 2016 and January 2017. During 2016 , these costs and expenses included asset impairment charges of $265 million, $168 million of severance and other human resource-related costs and $46 million of other related costs and expenses. Restructuring, impairment, store closing and other costs for 2015 included costs and expenses primarily associated with organization changes and store closings announced in January 2016. During 2015, these costs and expenses included asset impairment charges of $148 million, $123 million of severance and other human resource-related costs and $17 million of other related costs and expenses. Settlement Charges $98 million of non-cash settlement charges were recognized in 2016. These charges relate to the pro-rata recognition of net actuarial losses associated with the Company defined benefit retirement plans and are the result of an increase in lump sum distributions associated with store closings, a voluntary separation program, organizational restructuring, and periodic distribution activity. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense for 2016 decreased $2 million from 2015 . Net interest expense for 2016 was impacted by lower capitalized interest associated with the Company's construction projects, offset slightly by lower rates on outstanding borrowings as compared to 2015 . Effective Tax Rate The Company's effective tax rate of 35.8% for 2016 and 36.2% for 2015 differ from the federal income tax statutory rate of 35%, and on a comparative basis, principally because of the effect of state and local income taxes, including the settlement of various tax issues and tax examinations. Net Income Attributable to Macy's, Inc. Shareholders Net income attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders for 2016 decreased compared to 2015 , reflecting lower sales and gross margin and higher selling, general and administrative expenses, restructuring, impairments, store closing costs and other costs, settlement charges and net interest expense, partially offset by lower income taxes in 2016 as compared to 2015. 24 Guidance The Company's operations are impacted by competitive pressures from department stores, specialty stores, mass merchandisers, online retailers and all other retail channels. The Company's operations are also impacted by general consumer spending levels, including the impact of general economic conditions, consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability, cost and level of consumer debt, the costs of basic necessities and other goods and the effects of weather or natural disasters and other factors over which the Company has little or no control. In recent years, consumer spending levels have been affected to varying degrees by a number of factors, including modest economic growth, uncertainty regarding governmental spending and tax policies, unemployment levels, tightened consumer credit, an improving housing market and a fluctuating stock market. In addition, consumer spending levels of international customers are impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. These factors have affected, to varying degrees, the amount of funds that consumers are willing and able to spend for discretionary purchases, including purchases of some of the merchandise offered by the Company. All economic conditions ultimately affect the Company's overall operations. However, the effects of economic conditions can be experienced differently and at different times, in the various geographic regions in which the Company operates, in relation to the different types of merchandise that the Company offers for sale, or in relation to each of the Company's branded operations. Based on its assessment of current and anticipated market conditions and its recent performance and reflecting the adoption of new revenue recognition and pension accounting standards issued by the FASB, the Company's 2018 assumptions include the following: Net sales estimated decline of approximately 0.5% to 2.0% from 2017 levels. Net sales in 2017 reflected a 53rd week of sales, whereas comparable sales below are on a 52-week basis. Comparable sales on both an owned and owned plus licensed basis are estimated to be flat to up 1.0%. Gross margin on retail sales is estimated to be flat to up slightly compared to 2017. Credit income, reflecting changes from the new revenue recognition standard, estimated to be approximately $645 million to $665 million. Selling, general and administrative expense dollars are expected to be approximately flat with 2017 or up slightly depending on sales. Estimated asset sale gains of approximately $300 million to $325 million, including a successful sale of the Company's I. Magnin section of its Union Square store in San Francisco. Estimated interest expense of approximately $255 million to $260 million. Effective tax rate is expected to be 23.25%. Diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders, excluding certain items, is expected to be $3.55 to $3.75. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately flat with 2017. Capital expenditures are estimated at approximately $1,050 million. The Company's forecasted capital expenditures are primarily related to investments in several merchandising initiatives, continued growth of Backstage and bluemercury locations, expansion of store pick up, and the store, digital and technological enhancements associated with the Company's Growth 50 initiative. This initiative includes the roll-out of various strategies incubated in 2017 to 50 Macy's stores of different sizes and geography. In 2018, the Company expects excess cash to be used to invest in strategies and initiatives to help grow the business, continue to fund the Company's dividends and repay debt. 25 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash on hand and the credit facility described below. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,944 million in 2017 compared to $1,801 million in 2016 . The increase was driven by a 53rd week of operations and lower selling, general and administrative expenses offset by higher tax payments as compared to 2016. Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities for 2017 was $373 million , compared to net cash used by investing activities of $187 million for 2016 . Investing activities for 2017 included purchases of property and equipment totaling $487 million and capitalized software of $273 million , compared to purchases of property and equipment totaling $596 million and capitalized software of $316 million for 2016 . Capital expenditures were lower by $152 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. This decrease was mainly driven by intentional delays in capital projects that are estimated to begin in 2018 and are included in the Company's aforementioned 2018 guidance. In 2017, the Company continued to execute on its real estate strategy that includes creating value through monetization and, in some cases, redevelopment of real estate assets. Overall, property and equipment sales, primarily related to real estate, generated cash proceeds of $411 million in 2017 compared to $673 million in 2016. During 2017, the Company opened two new Macy's stores and 36 new freestanding bluemercury stores. During 2016, the Company opened one new Macy's store, one new Bloomingdale's The Outlet store, one new freestanding Macy's Backstage store and 24 new freestanding bluemercury stores. Financing Activities Net cash used by the Company for financing activities was $1,413 million for 2017 , including the repayment of $954 million of debt and the payment of $461 million of cash dividends, partially offset by the issuance of $6 million of Common Stock, primarily related to the exercise of stock options, and proceeds of $13 million received from Macy's China Limited's noncontrolling interest shareholder. During December 2017, the Company completed a tender offer and purchased $400 million in aggregate principal amount of certain senior unsecured notes and debentures. The purchased senior unsecured notes and debentures included $147 million of 6.9% senior debentures due 2032, $108 million of 6.7% senior debentures due 2034, $96 million of 6.375% senior notes due 2037, $43 million of 8.75% senior debentures due 2029, and $6 million of 7.875% senior debentures due 2030. The total cash cost for the tender offer was $423 million. The Company recognized $11 million of income related to the recognition of the unamortized debt premium partially offset by the redemption premium and other costs associated with this debt as net premiums on early retirement of debt on the Consolidated Statements of Income during 2017. In July 2017 the Company paid $300 million of debt at maturity. During the first and second quarters of 2017, the Company repurchased $247 million face value of senior notes and debentures. The debt repurchases were made in the open market for a total cash cost of $257 million , including expenses related to the transactions. Such repurchases resulted in the recognition of expense of $1 million during 2017 presented as net premiums on early retirement of debt on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Net cash used by the Company for financing activities was $1,426 million for 2016 and included the acquisition of the Company's Common Stock under its share repurchase program at a cost of $316 million , the repayment of $751 million of debt and the payment of $459 million of cash dividends, partially offset by an increase in outstanding checks of $61 million and the issuance of $36 million of Common Stock, primarily related to the exercise of stock options. During August 2016, the Company redeemed at par the principal amount of $108 million of 7.875% senior debentures due 2036, pursuant to the terms of the debentures. Interest expense in 2016 benefited from the recognition of 26 unamortized debt premium associated with this debt. During October 2016, the Company repaid $59 million of 7.45% senior debentures at maturity. During December 2016, the Company repaid $577 million of 5.9% senior notes at maturity. The Company entered into a new credit agreement with certain financial institutions as of May 6, 2016 providing for revolving credit borrowings and letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1,500 million (which may be increased to $1,750 million at the option of the Company, subject to the willingness of existing or new lenders to provide commitments for such additional financing) outstanding at any particular time. This agreement is set to expire May 6, 2021 and replaced the prior agreement which was set to expire May 10, 2018. As of February 3, 2018 , and January 28, 2017 , there were no revolving credit loans outstanding under this credit agreement, and there were no borrowings under the agreement during 2017 and 2016 . In addition, there were no standby letters of credit outstanding at February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017 . Revolving loans under the credit agreement bear interest based on various published rates. The Company is party to a $1,500 million unsecured commercial paper program. The Company may issue and sell commercial paper in an aggregate amount outstanding at any particular time not to exceed its then-current combined borrowing availability under the bank credit agreement with certain financial institutions. Over the past two fiscal years, the amount of borrowings under the commercial paper program increased to its highest level for 2016 of approximately $ 388 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. There were no borrowings under the program during 2017 . As of February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, there were no remaining borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program. The credit agreement requires the Company to maintain a specified interest coverage ratio for the latest four quarters of no less than 3.25 and a specified leverage ratio as of and for the latest four quarters of no more than 3.75. The Company's interest coverage ratio for 2017 was 8.94 and its leverage ratio at February 3, 2018 was 2.04 , in each case as calculated in accordance with the credit agreement. The interest coverage ratio is defined as EBITDA divided by net interest expense and the leverage ratio is defined as debt divided by EBITDA. For purposes of these calculations EBITDA is calculated as net income plus interest expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment of goodwill, intangibles and real estate, non-recurring cash charges not to exceed in the aggregate $300 million and extraordinary losses less interest income and non-recurring or extraordinary gains. Debt is adjusted to exclude the premium on acquired debt and net interest is adjusted to exclude the amortization of premium on acquired debt and premium on early retirement of debt. A breach of a restrictive covenant in the Company's credit agreement or the inability of the Company to maintain the financial ratios described above could result in an event of default under the credit agreement. In addition, an event of default would occur under the credit agreement if any indebtedness of the Company in excess of an aggregate principal amount of $150 million becomes due prior to its stated maturity or the holders of such indebtedness become able to cause it to become due prior to its stated maturity. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders could, subject to the terms and conditions of the credit agreement, elect to declare the outstanding principal, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. Moreover, most of the Company's senior notes and debentures contain cross-default provisions based on the non-payment at maturity, or other default after an applicable grace period, of any other debt, the unpaid principal amount of which is not less than $100 million that could be triggered by an event of default under the credit agreement. In such an event, the Company's senior notes and debentures that contain cross-default provisions would also be subject to acceleration. At February 3, 2018 , no notes or debentures contain provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade. However, the terms of approximately $4,019 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company's senior notes outstanding at that date require the Company to offer to purchase such notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in specified circumstances involving both a change of control (as defined in the applicable indenture) of the Company and the rating of the notes by specified rating agencies at a level below investment grade. During 2016, the Company repurchased approximately 7.9 million shares of its Common Stock for a total of approximately $316 million . As of February 3, 2018 , the Company had $1,716 million of authorization remaining under its share repurchase program. The Company may continue or, from time to time, suspend repurchases of shares under its share repurchase program, depending on prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital and other factors. On February 23, 2018, the Company's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 37.75 cents per share on its Common Stock, payable April 2, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2018. 27 Contractual Obligations and Commitments At February 3, 2018 , the Company had contractual obligations (within the scope of Item 303(a)(5) of Regulation S-K) as follows: Obligations Due, by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years (millions) Short-term debt $ 21 $ 21 $ $ $ Long-term debt 5,806 581 553 4,672 Interest on debt 3,114 286 566 500 1,762 Capital lease obligations 49 3 6 6 34 Operating leases 3,546 327 586 494 2,139 Letters of credit 28 28 Other obligations 4,525 2,476 1,026 230 793 $ 17,089 $ 3,141 $ 2,765 $ 1,783 $ 9,400 Other obligations in the foregoing table includes post employment and postretirement benefits, self-insurance reserves, group medical/dental/life insurance programs, merchandise purchase obligations and obligations under outsourcing arrangements, construction contracts, energy and other supply agreements identified by the Company and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that the Company expects to settle in cash in the next year. The Company's merchandise purchase obligations fluctuate on a seasonal basis, typically being higher in the summer and early fall and being lower in the late winter and early spring. The Company purchases a substantial portion of its merchandise inventories and other goods and services otherwise than through binding contracts. Consequently, the amounts shown as Other obligations in the foregoing table do not reflect the total amounts that the Company would need to spend on goods and services in order to operate its businesses in the ordinary course. The Company has not included in the contractual obligations table $125 million of long-term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various tax positions taken. The table also excludes federal, state and local interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of $27 million included in other liabilities and $24 million included in current income taxes. These liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations, and given the status of examinations, the Company cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. The Company has included in the contractual obligations table $11 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that the Company expects to settle in cash in the next year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Outlook Management believes that, with respect to the Company's current operations, cash on hand and funds from operations, together with its credit facility and other capital resources, will be sufficient to cover the Company's reasonably foreseeable working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements and other cash requirements in both the near term and over the longer term. The Company's ability to generate funds from operations may be affected by numerous factors, including general economic conditions and levels of consumer confidence and demand; however, the Company expects to be able to manage its working capital levels and capital expenditure amounts so as to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity. To the extent that the Company's cash balances from time to time exceed amounts that are needed to fund its immediate liquidity requirements, the Company will consider alternative uses of some or all of such excess cash. Such alternative uses may include, among others, the redemption or repurchase of debt, equity or other securities through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, and the funding of pension related obligations. Depending upon its actual and anticipated sources and uses of liquidity, conditions in the capital markets and other factors, the Company will from time to time consider the issuance of debt or other securities, or other possible capital markets transactions, for the purpose of raising capital which could be used to refinance current indebtedness or for other corporate purposes including the redemption or repurchase of debt, equity or other securities through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, and the funding of pension related obligations. 28 The Company intends from time to time to consider additional acquisitions of, and investments in, retail businesses and other complementary assets and companies. Acquisition transactions, if any, are expected to be financed from one or more of the following sources: cash on hand, cash from operations, borrowings under existing or new credit facilities and the issuance of long-term debt or other securities, including Common Stock. Important Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of the Company's financial information with additional useful information in evaluating operating performance. Management believes that providing supplemental changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis, which includes the impact of growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties, assists in evaluating the Company's ability to generate sales growth, whether through owned businesses or departments licensed to third parties, on a comparable basis, and in evaluating the impact of changes in the manner in which certain departments are operated. In addition, management believes that excluding certain items that are not associated with the Company's core operations and that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude period-to-period from diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders, operating income, EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) and EBITDA as percentages to sales provides useful supplemental measures that assist in evaluating the Company's ability to generate earnings and leverage sales, respectively, and to more readily compare these metrics between past and future periods. Management also believes that EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, and that such supplemental measures facilitate comparisons between companies that have different capital and financing structures and/or tax rates. In addition, management believes that ROIC is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating how efficiently the Company employs its capital. The Company uses some of these non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures for components of executive compensation. The reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure of changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis to GAAP comparable sales (i.e., on an owned basis) is in the same manner as illustrated below, where the impact of growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties is the only reconciling item. In addition, the Company does not provide the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure of diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy s, Inc. shareholders excluding certain items because the timing and amount of excluded items are unreasonably difficult to fully and accurately estimate. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the Company's actual and future financial condition and performance. Additionally, the amounts received by the Company on account of sales of departments licensed to third parties are limited to commissions received on such sales. The methods used by the Company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. 29 Change in Comparable Sales The following is a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis, to GAAP comparable sales (i.e., on an owned basis), which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 14 weeks ended February 3, 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Increase (decrease) in comparable sales on an owned basis (note 1) 1.3% (2.2)% (3.5)% (3.0)% 0.7% 1.9% Impact of growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties (note 2) 0.1% 0.3% 0.6% 0.5% 0.7% 0.9% Increase (decrease) in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis 1.4% (1.9)% (2.9)% (2.5)% 1.4% 2.8% Notes: (1) Represents the period-to-period percentage change in net sales from stores in operation throughout the year presented and the immediately preceding year and all online sales, adjusting for the 53rd week in 2017, excluding commissions from departments licensed to third parties. Stores impacted by a natural disaster or undergoing significant expansion or shrinkage remain in the comparable sales calculation unless the store is closed for a significant period of time. Definitions and calculations of comparable sales differ among companies in the retail industry. (2) Represents the impact of including the sales of departments licensed to third parties occurring in stores in operation throughout the year presented and the immediately preceding year and all online sales, adjusting for the 53rd week in 2017, in the calculation of comparable sales. The Company licenses third parties to operate certain departments in its stores and online and receives commissions from these third parties based on a percentage of their net sales. In its financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP, the Company includes these commissions (rather than sales of the departments licensed to third parties) in its net sales. The Company does not, however, include any amounts in respect of licensed department sales (or any commissions earned on such sales) in its comparable sales in accordance with GAAP (i.e., on an owned basis). The amounts of commissions earned on sales of departments licensed to third parties are not material to its net sales for the periods presented. Operating Income, Excluding Certain Items, as a Percent to Net Sales The following is a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure operating income, excluding certain items, as a percent to net sales to GAAP operating income as a percent to net sales, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 (millions, except percentages) Net sales $ 24,837 $ 25,778 $ 27,079 $ 28,105 $ 27,931 Operating income $ 1,807 $ 1,315 $ 2,039 $ 2,800 $ 2,678 Operating income as a percent to net sales 7.3 % 5.1 % 7.5 % 10.0 % 9.6 % Operating income $ 1,807 $ 1,315 $ 2,039 $ 2,800 $ 2,678 Add back restructuring, impairment, store closing and other costs 186 479 288 87 88 Add back settlement charges 105 98 Operating income, excluding certain items $ 2,098 $ 1,892 $ 2,327 $ 2,887 $ 2,766 Operating income, excluding certain items, as a percent to net sales 8.4 % 7.3 % 8.6 % 10.3 % 9.9 % 30 Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Macy's, Inc. Shareholders, Excluding Certain Items The following is a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders, excluding certain items, to GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders $ 5.04 $ 1.99 $ 3.22 $ 4.22 $ 3.86 Add back the pre-tax impact of restructuring, impairment, store closing and other costs 0.61 1.54 0.86 0.24 0.23 Add back the pre-tax impact of settlement charges 0.34 0.31 Add back (deduct) the pre-tax impact of net premiums on the early retirement of debt (0.03 ) 0.05 Deduct the income tax impact of certain items identified above (0.33 ) (0.73 ) (0.31 ) (0.11 ) (0.09 ) Deduct the deferred tax effects of federal tax reform (1.86 ) Diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders, excluding certain items $ 3.77 $ 3.11 $ 3.77 $ 4.40 $ 4.00 Adjusted EBIT and EBITDA as a Percent to Net Sales The following is a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT") and earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), as adjusted to exclude certain items ("Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA"), as a percent to net sales to GAAP net income as a percent to net sales, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 (millions, except percentages) Net sales $ 24,837 $ 25,778 $ 27,079 $ 28,105 $ 27,931 Net income $ 1,536 $ 611 $ 1,070 $ 1,526 $ 1,486 Net income as a percent to net sales 6.2 % 2.4 % 4.0 % 5.4 % 5.3 % Net income $ 1,536 $ 611 $ 1,070 $ 1,526 $ 1,486 Add back restructuring, impairment, store closing and other costs 186 479 288 87 88 Add back settlement charges 105 98 Add back interest expense - net 310 363 361 393 388 Add back (deduct) net premiums on the early retirement of debt (10 ) 17 Add back (deduct) federal, state and local income tax expense (benefit) (29 ) 341 608 864 804 Adjusted EBIT $ 2,098 $ 1,892 $ 2,327 $ 2,887 $ 2,766 Adjusted EBIT as a percent to net sales 8.4 % 7.3 % 8.6 % 10.3 % 9.9 % Add back depreciation and amortization 991 1,058 1,061 1,036 1,020 Adjusted EBITDA $ 3,089 $ 2,950 $ 3,388 $ 3,923 $ 3,786 Adjusted EBITDA as a percent to net sales 12.4 % 11.4 % 12.5 % 14.0 % 13.6 % 31 ROIC The Company defines ROIC as adjusted operating income as a percent to average invested capital. Average invested capital is comprised of an annual two-point (i.e., end of the year presented and the immediately preceding year) average of gross property and equipment, a capitalized value of non-capitalized leases equal to periodic annual reported net rent expense multiplied by a factor of eight and a four-point (i.e., end of each quarter within the period presented) average of other selected assets and liabilities. The calculation of the capitalized value of non-capitalized leases is consistent with industry and credit rating agency practice and the specified assets are subject to a four-point average to compensate for seasonal fluctuations. The following is a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of ROIC to operating income as a percent to property and equipment - net, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 (millions, except percentages) Operating income $ 1,807 $ 1,315 $ 2,039 $ 2,800 $ 2,678 Property and equipment - net $ 6,845 $ 7,317 $ 7,708 $ 7,865 $ 8,063 Operating income as a percent to property and equipment - net 26.4 % 18.0 % 26.5 % 35.6 % 33.2 % Operating income $ 1,807 $ 1,315 $ 2,039 $ 2,800 $ 2,678 Add back restructuring, impairment, store closing and other costs 186 479 288 87 88 Add back settlement charges 105 98 Add back depreciation and amortization 991 1,058 1,061 1,036 1,020 Add back rent expense, net Real estate 325 319 301 279 268 Personal property 10 11 12 12 11 Deferred rent amortization 14 9 8 7 8 Adjusted operating income $ 3,438 $ 3,289 $ 3,709 $ 4,221 $ 4,073 Property and equipment - net $ 6,845 $ 7,317 $ 7,708 $ 7,865 $ 8,063 Add back accumulated depreciation and amortization 4,733 5,088 5,457 5,830 6,007 Add capitalized value of non-capitalized leases 2,792 2,712 2,568 2,384 2,296 Add (deduct) other selected assets and liabilities: Receivables 327 402 338 336 339 Merchandise inventories 5,712 6,012 6,226 6,155 6,065 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 422 456 453 443 398 Other assets 830 881 775 784 659 Merchandise accounts payable (2,115 ) (2,173 ) (2,366 ) (2,472 ) (2,520 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (3,027 ) (2,924 ) (2,677 ) (2,511 ) (2,328 ) Total average invested capital $ 16,519 $ 17,771 $ 18,482 $ 18,814 $ 18,979 ROIC 20.8 % 18.5 % 20.1 % 22.4 % 21.5 % 32 Critical Accounting Policies Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, inventory is segregated into departments of merchandise having similar characteristics, and is stated at its current retail selling value. The retail inventory method inherently requires management judgments and estimates, such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow-moving inventory, which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margins. Permanent markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the utility of the inventory has diminished. Factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise and fashion trends. When a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise, the resulting gross profit reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded. Long-Lived Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges The carrying values of long-lived assets are periodically reviewed by the Company whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as historical operating losses or plans to close stores before the end of their previously estimated useful lives. Additionally, on an annual basis, the recoverability of the carrying values of individual stores is evaluated. A potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets. The estimate of cash flows includes management's assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations. When a potential impairment has occurred, an impairment write-down is recorded if the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. The Company believes its estimated cash flows are sufficient to support the carrying value of its long-lived assets. If estimated cash flows significantly differ in the future, the Company may be required to record asset impairment write-downs. If the Company commits to a plan to dispose of a long-lived asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life, estimated cash flows are revised accordingly, and the Company may be required to record an asset impairment write-down. Additionally, related liabilities arise such as severance, contractual obligations and other accruals associated with store closings from decisions to dispose of assets. The Company estimates these liabilities based on the facts and circumstances in existence for each restructuring decision. The amounts the Company will ultimately realize or disburse could differ from the amounts assumed in arriving at the asset impairment and restructuring charge recorded. Income Taxes Income taxes are estimated based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred income tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Uncertain tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Uncertain tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are then measured to determine the amount of benefit eligible for recognition in the financial statements. Each uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated and adjusted as appropriate, while taking into account the progress of audits of various taxing jurisdictions. Resolution of these matters could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's uncertain tax positions, provision for income taxes, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. Although the Company believes that its judgments are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company's historical income provisions and accruals. 33 Pension and Supplementary Retirement Plans The Company has a funded defined benefit pension plan (the Pension Plan ) and an unfunded defined benefit supplementary retirement plan (the SERP ). The Company accounts for these plans in accordance with ASC Topic 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits. Under ASC Topic 715, an employer recognizes the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognizes changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. Additionally, pension expense is generally recognized on an accrual basis over the average remaining lifetime of participants. The pension expense calculation is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 provides the funding requirements for the Pension Plan which are different from the employer's accounting for the plan as outlined in ASC Topic 715. No funding contributions were required, and the Company made no funding contributions to the Pension Plan in 2017 and 2016. As of the date of this report, the Company does not anticipate making funding contributions to the Pension Plan in 2018. Management believes that, with respect to the Company's current operations, cash on hand and funds from operations, together with available borrowing under its credit facility and other capital resources, will be sufficient to cover the Company's Pension Plan cash requirements in both the near term and also over the longer term. The calculation of pension expense and pension liabilities requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience may differ significantly from current expectations. The Company believes that the most critical assumptions relate to the long-term rate of return on plan assets (in the case of the Pension Plan) and the discount rate used to determine the present value of projected benefit obligations. The Company's assumed annual long-term rate of return for the Pension Plan's assets was 7.00% for 2017, 2016 and 2015 based on expected future returns on the portfolio of assets. For 2018, the Company is lowering the assumed annual long-term rate of return to 6.75% based on expected future returns of the portfolio of assets. The Company develops its expected long-term rate of return assumption by evaluating input from several professional advisors taking into account the asset allocation of the portfolio and long-term asset class return expectations, as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Pension expense increases or decreases as the expected rate of return on the assets of the Pension Plan decreases or increases, respectively. Lowering or raising the expected long-term rate of return assumption on the Pension Plan's assets by 0.25% would increase or decrease the estimated 2018 pension expense by approximately $8 million. The Company discounted its future pension obligations using a weighted-average rate of 3.74% at February 3, 2018 and 4.00% at January 28, 2017 for the Pension Plan and 3.78% at February 3, 2018 and 4.07% at January 28, 2017 for the SERP. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the Company's Pension Plan and SERP obligations is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with various maturities. Each year's expected future benefit payments are discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate, thereby generating the overall discount rate for Pension Plan and SERP obligations. As the discount rate is reduced or increased, the pension liability would increase or decrease, respectively, and future pension expense would decrease or increase, respectively. Lowering the discount rates by 0.25% would increase the projected benefit obligations at February 3, 2018 by approximately $92 million and would decrease estimated 2018 pension expense by approximately $3 million. Increasing the discount rates by 0.25% would decrease the projected benefit obligations at February 3, 2018 by approximately $85 million and would increase estimated 2018 pension expense by approximately $3 million. In 2016, the Company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for the Pension Plan and SERP. The new method uses a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of net periodic benefit costs. Under this approach, the Company applies discounting using individual spot rates from the yield curve composed of the rates of return from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities available at the measurement date. These spot rates align to each of the projected benefit obligation and service cost cash flows. Historically, the Company estimated the service and interest cost components using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligations. The Company made this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively starting in 2016. 34 New Pronouncements Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which establishes principles to report useful information to financial statements users about the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue from contracts with customers. ASU No. 2014-09 along with various related amendments comprise ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and provide guidance that is applicable to all contracts with customers regardless of industry-specific or transaction-specific fact patterns. The new standard and its related updates were effective for the Company on February 4, 2018. On the effective date, the Company will apply the new guidance retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented. Overall, the new standard will not have a material impact to the results of the Company's operations or consolidated statements of financial position, but will change the presentation and timing of certain revenue transactions. The Company currently estimates the impacts to its consolidated financial statements to include gross presentation of its estimates for future sales returns and related recoverable assets, presenting income from credit operations, gift card breakage income and Thanks For Sharing loyalty program income as separate components of revenue and recognizing gift card breakage revenue over the period of redemption for gift cards associated with certain returns. In addition, on a quarterly basis, the timing of recognizing revenue for the Company's Thanks For Sharing loyalty program will change as compared to historical recognition. The Company's evaluation of the new standards included a review of certain vendor arrangements to determine whether the Company acts as principal or agent in such arrangements. The Company does not expect material changes in gross versus net presentation as a result of the adoption of the new standard. The following tables reflect the preliminary and unaudited expected impacts to reported 2017 and 2016 results, respectively, for the impact of the adoption of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 2017 (Unaudited) As Reported New Revenue Standard Adjustments As Adjusted Consolidated Statement of Income: (dollars in millions, except per share figures) Net sales $ 24,837 $ 104 $ 24,941 Credit card revenues, net 702 702 Cost of sales (15,152 ) (30 ) (15,182 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (8,131 ) (766 ) (8,897 ) Federal, state and local income tax benefit 29 (2 ) 27 Net income attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders 1,547 8 1,555 Diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders 5.04 0.02 5.06 2016 (Unaudited) As Reported New Revenue Standard Adjustments As Adjusted Consolidated Statement of Income: (dollars in millions, except per share figures) Net sales $ 25,778 $ 132 $ 25,910 Credit card revenues, net 656 656 Cost of sales (15,621 ) (46 ) (15,667 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (8,474 ) (728 ) (9,202 ) Federal, state and local income tax expense (341 ) (5 ) (346 ) Net income attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders 619 9 628 Diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders 1.99 0.03 2.02 35 2017 (Unaudited) As Reported New Revenue Standard Adjustments As Adjusted Consolidated Balance Sheet: (dollars in millions) Prepaid expenses and other current assets 448 $ 448 $ 201 $ 649 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 3,167 3,167 102 3,269 Deferred income taxes 1,122 1,122 25 1,147 Total Shareholders' equity 5,661 5,661 74 5,735 2016 (Unaudited) As Reported New Revenue Standard Adjustments As Adjusted Consolidated Balance Sheet: (dollars in millions) Prepaid expenses and other current assets 448 $ 408 $ 232 $ 640 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 3,167 3,563 143 3,706 Deferred income taxes 1,122 1,443 35 1,478 Total Shareholders' equity 5,661 4,322 54 4,376 Adoption of ASC Topic 606 is not expected to impact cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (ASC Topic 842), which requires lessees to recognize substantially all leases on-balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. The new standard establishes a right of use ("ROU") model that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for the Company on February 3, 2019. Currently, the new standard is to be adopted utilizing a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the consolidated financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. However, the FASB has proposed another transition method, in addition to the existing requirements, to transition to the new lease standard by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. The Company is awaiting finalization of the alternatives for transitioning to the new standard before deciding upon a method of adoption. The Company expects that the new lease standard will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. While the Company is continuing to assess the effects of adoption, the Company currently believes the most significant changes relate to the recognition of new ROU assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for real property and personal property operating leases as well as changes to the timing of recognition of certain real estate asset sale gains in the consolidated statements of income due to application of the new sale-leaseback guidance and ASU No. 2017-05, Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of NonFinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20). The Company expects that substantially all of its operating lease commitments disclosed in Note 4, "Properties and Leases", to the consolidated financial statements will be subject to the new guidance and will be recognized as operating lease liabilities and ROU assets upon adoption. A significant change in leasing activity between the date of this report and adoption is not expected. Retirement Plans In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (ASC Topic 715), which requires employers to disaggregate the service cost component from other components of net periodic benefit costs and to disclose the amounts of net periodic benefit costs that are included in each income statement line item. The standard requires employers to report the service cost component in the same line item as other compensation costs and to report the other components of net periodic benefit costs (which include interest costs, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost or credits and actuarial gains and losses) separately and outside a subtotal of operating income. The 36 income statement guidance requires application on a retrospective basis. For 2017 and 2016, $57 million and $55 million , respectively, of net retirement plan income, excluding service cost, and settlement charges of $105 million and $98 million , respectively, will be reclassified to separate financial statement captions below operating income. This standard was effective for the Company on February 4, 2018. Goodwill In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (ASC Topic 350), which eliminates the second step in the two-step goodwill impairment test. Previously the second step required the computation of the implied fair value of goodwill by determining the fair value of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities). Under the new standard, an entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary for its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test. If the quantitative impairment test is deemed necessary, the Company should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. This standard is effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on February 2, 2020. The Company elected to early adopt this new standard in the fourth quarter of 2017. The adoption of this new standard did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Statement of Cash Flows In 2016 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (ASC Topic 230): Restricted Cash, and ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (ASC Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. These standards were issued to resolve numerous diversities in practice with regards to the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The standards were effective for the Company on February 4, 2018, and will be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The standards will change the Company's classification of cash payments for debt prepayment and extinguishment costs from an operating outflow to a financing outflow. Additionally, the standards will result in the Company including its restricted cash balances with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on its statements of cash flows to explain the change in restricted cash during the respective periods. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of any other recent accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Comprehensive Income In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which allows for stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, to be reclassified to retained earnings. The new standard is effective for the Company on February 3, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard and does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the Company financial position or results of operations. 37
