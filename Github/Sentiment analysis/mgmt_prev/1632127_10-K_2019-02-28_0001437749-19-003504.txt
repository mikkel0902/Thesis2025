ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the discussion in the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Business . This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors. Overview Our Business We are a fully integrated provider of data, video and voice services in 21 Western, Midwestern and Southern states. We provide these broadband services to residential and business customers in more than 750 communities. The markets we serve are primarily non-metropolitan, secondary markets, with 78% of our customers located in seven states: Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. Our biggest customer concentrations are in the Mississippi Gulf Coast region and in the greater Boise, Idaho region. We provided service to 804,865 residential and business customers out of approximately 2.1 million homes passed as of December 31, 2018. Of these customers, 663,074 subscribed to data services, 326,423 subscribed to video services and 125,934 subscribed to voice services. We generate substantially all our revenues through five primary products. Ranked by share of our total revenues during 2018, they are residential data (46.0%), residential video (32.0%), business services (data, voice and video 14.5%), residential voice (3.8%) and advertising sales (2.3%). The profit margins, growth rates and capital intensity of our five primary products vary significantly due to competition, product maturity and relative costs. In 2018, our Adjusted EBITDA margins for residential data and business services were approximately six and seven times greater, respectively, than for residential video. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin for a product line as Adjusted EBITDA attributable to that product line divided by revenue attributable to that product line (see Use of Adjusted EBITDA below for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure). This margin disparity is largely the result of significant programming costs and retransmission fees incurred to deliver residential video services, which in each of the last three years represented between 53% and 62% of total residential video revenues. None of our other product lines has direct costs representing as substantial a portion of revenues as programming costs and retransmission fees represent for residential video, and indirect costs are allocated equally on a per PSU basis. Programming costs and retransmission fees have a meaningfully lower impact on business services margins than residential video because business services include data and voice, in addition to video, diminishing the relative impact of programming costs and retransmission fees on that product line as a whole. 34 Table of Contents Prior to 2012, we were focused on growing revenues through subscriber retention and growth in overall PSUs. Accordingly, our strategies consisted of, among others, offering promotional discounts to new and existing subscribers adding new services and to subscribers purchasing more than one service offering. Since 2012, we have adapted our strategy to face the industry-wide trends of declining profitability of residential video services and declining revenues from residential voice services. We believe the declining profitability of residential video services is primarily due to increasing programming costs and retransmission fees and competition from other content providers, and the declining revenues from residential voice services is primarily due to the increasing use of wireless voice services instead of residential voice services. Beginning in 2013, we shifted our focus away from maximizing customer PSUs and towards growing our higher margin businesses, namely residential data and business services. Separately, we have also focused on retaining customers with a high expected LTV, who are less attracted by discounting, require less support and churn less. This strategy focuses on increasing Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures and margins. The trends described above have impacted our four largest product lines in the following ways: Residential data . We experienced growth in the number of, and revenues from, our residential data customers every year since 2013. We expect this growth to continue due to projected increases in the number of potential customers for us to serve, as there are still a number of households in our markets that do not subscribe to data services from any provider. We expect to capture a portion of these customers and anticipate capturing additional market share from existing data subscribers due to our continued upgrades in broadband capacity, our ability to offer higher access speeds than many of our competitors and our Wi-Fi support service. Residential video. Residential video service is a highly competitive business. As we focus on the higher-margin businesses of residential data and business services, we have de-emphasized our residential video business and, as a result, expect residential video revenues to continue to decline in the future. Residential voice. We have experienced declines in residential voice customers as a result of homes in the United States deciding to terminate their residential voice services and exclusively use wireless voice services. We believe this trend will continue because of competition from wireless voice service providers. Revenues from residential voice customers have declined over recent years, and we expect this decline will continue. Business services . We have experienced significant growth in business data and voice customers and revenues, and we expect this growth to continue. We attribute this growth to our strategic focus on increasing sales to business customers and our efforts to attract enterprise business customers. Margins in products sold to business customers have remained attractive, and we expect this trend to continue. We continue to experience increased competition, particularly from telephone companies, cable and municipal overbuilders, OTT video providers and DBS television providers. Because of the levels of competition we face, we believe it is important to make investments in our infrastructure. We elevated our capital investments between 2012 and 2018 to increase our plant capacities and reliability, launch all-digital video services (which has made available approximately half of average plant bandwidth for data services) and increase data capacity by moving from four-channel bonding to 32-channel bonding (to enable our GigaONE data service). We expect to continue devoting financial resources to infrastructure improvements, including in the new markets we acquired in the NewWave and Clearwave transactions, because we believe these investments are necessary to remain competitive. We expect to spend up to $35 million during 2019, in addition to the combined nearly $27 million spent for NewWave in 2018 and 2017, to enhance those acquired operations by rebuilding low capacity markets, launching all-digital video services, implementing 32-channel bonding, converting back office functions such as billing, accounting and service provisioning, migrating products to legacy Cable One platforms and expanding our high-capacity fiber network. Our primary business goals are to continue growing residential data and business services, to increase profit margins and to deliver strong Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures. To achieve these goals, we intend to continue our industrial engineering-driven cost management, remain focused on customers with high LTV and follow through with further planned investments in broadband plant upgrades and new data service offerings for residential and business customers. On May 1, 2017, we acquired NewWave, a provider of data, video and voice services to residential and business customers throughout non-urban areas of Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. We paid a purchase price of $740.2 million in cash on a debt-free basis. In connection with the transaction, we amended our existing credit agreement and incurred $750.0 million of senior secured loans which were used to finance the acquisition, repay in full our then-existing term loan and pay related fees and expenses. Refer to notes 4 and 9 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details on these transactions. 35 Table of Contents On January 8, 2019, we acquired Clearwave, a facilities-based service provider that owns and operates a high-capacity fiber network offering dense regional coverage in Southern Illinois. We paid a purchase price of $357.0 million in cash on a debt-free basis, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The acquisition provides us with a premier fiber network within our existing footprint, further enables us to supply our customers with enhanced business services solutions and provides a platform to allow us to replicate Clearwave strategy in several of our other markets. Results of Operations PSU and Customer Counts During 2018, our total PSUs decreased 26,491, or 2.3%, compared to our total PSUs as of December 31, 2017. Residential data PSUs and business PSUs increased 15,862 and 4,827, respectively, while residential video PSUs and residential voice PSUs decreased 36,237 and 10,943, respectively. Our total customer relationships increased 7,328, or 0.9%, year-over-year, with increases of 4,089 and 3,239 in business and residential customer relationships, respectively. During 2017, our total PSUs increased 191,957, or 20.2%, compared to our total PSUs as of December 31, 2016, with increases in residential data, video and voice PSUs of 115,801, 40,149 and 12,289, respectively, and an increase in business PSUs of 23,718. Our total customer relationships increased 140,315, or 21.3%, year-over-year. The year-over-year increases were primarily attributable to new customers acquired as a result of the NewWave acquisition. The following table provides an overview of selected customer data for the time periods specified: As of December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Residential data PSUs 600,716 584,854 469,053 Residential video PSUs (1) 310,475 346,712 306,563 Residential voice PSUs 99,070 110,013 97,724 Total residential PSUs 1,010,261 1,041,579 873,340 Business data PSUs (2) 62,358 58,299 44,855 Business video PSUs 15,948 17,176 13,683 Business voice PSUs (3) 26,864 24,868 18,087 Total business PSUs 105,170 100,343 76,625 Total data PSUs 663,074 643,153 513,908 Total video PSUs 326,423 363,888 320,246 Total voice PSUs 125,934 134,881 115,811 Total PSUs 1,115,431 1,141,922 949,965 Total residential customer relationships 734,250 731,011 605,699 Total business customer relationships 70,615 66,526 51,523 Total customer relationships 804,865 797,537 657,222 (1) Residential video PSUs include all basic residential customers who receive video services and may have one or more digital set-top boxes or cable cards deployed. Residential bulk multi-dwelling accounts are included in our video PSUs at the individual unit level. (2) Business data PSUs include commercial accounts that receive data service via a cable modem and commercial accounts that receive data service optically via fiber connections. (3) Business voice customers who have multiple voice lines are only counted once in the PSU total. In recent years, our customer mix has shifted, causing subscribers to move from triple-play packages combining data, video and voice services to single and double-play packages. This is largely because some residential video customers have defected to DBS services and OTT offerings and more households have discontinued residential voice service. In addition, we have focused on selling data-only packages to new customers rather than cross-selling video to these customers. 36 Table of Contents 2018 Compared to 2017 Revenues Revenues increased $112.3 million, or 11.7%, due primarily to increases in residential data, business services and residential video revenues of $76.5 million, $24.9 million and $10.8 million, respectively. The increase was the result of four additional months of NewWave operations and organic growth in our higher margin product lines of residential data and business services. Revenues by service offering were as follows for 2018 and 2017, together with the percentages of total revenues that each item represented for the years presented (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2018 vs. 2017 Revenues % of Total Revenues % of Total $ Change % Change Residential data $ 492,816 46.0 $ 416,355 43.4 $ 76,461 18.4 Residential video 343,344 32.0 332,536 34.6 10,808 3.3 Residential voice 41,278 3.8 43,733 4.6 (2,455 ) (5.6 ) Business services 155,993 14.5 131,082 13.7 24,911 19.0 Advertising sales 24,919 2.3 24,824 2.6 95 0.4 Other 13,945 1.4 11,426 1.1 2,519 22.0 Total revenues $ 1,072,295 100.0 $ 959,956 100.0 $ 112,339 11.7 Average monthly revenue per unit for the indicated service offerings were as follows for 2018 and 2017: Year Ended December 31, 2018 vs. 2017 2018 2017 $ Change % Change Residential data (1) $ 68.70 $ 63.28 $ 5.42 8.6 Residential video (1) $ 86.96 $ 81.07 $ 5.89 7.3 Residential voice (1) $ 32.86 $ 33.80 $ (0.94 ) (2.8 ) Business services (2) $ 187.32 $ 177.73 $ 9.59 5.4 (1) Average monthly revenue per unit values represent the applicable annual residential service revenues (excluding installation and activation fees) divided by the corresponding average of the number of PSUs at the beginning and end of each year, divided by 12, except that for any new PSUs added as a result of an acquisition occurring during the reporting period, the associated average monthly revenue per unit values represent the applicable residential service revenues (excluding installation and activation fees) divided by the pro-rated number of PSUs during such period. (2) Average monthly revenue per unit values represent annual business services revenues (excluding installation and activation fees) divided by the average of the number of business customer relationships at the beginning and end of each year, divided by 12, except that for any new business customer relationships added as a result of an acquisition occurring during the reporting period, the associated average monthly revenue per unit values represent business services revenues (excluding installation and activation fees) divided by the pro-rated number of business customer relationships during such period. Revenues by service offering, excluding the impact of revenues related to legacy NewWave systems, were as follows for 2018 and 2017, together with the percentages of total revenues that each item represented for the years presented (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2018 vs. 2017 Revenues % of Total Revenues % of Total $ Change % Change Residential data $ 415,503 47.2 $ 372,876 44.8 $ 42,627 11.4 Residential video 270,170 30.7 278,445 33.4 (8,275 ) (3.0 ) Residential voice 34,690 3.9 37,460 4.5 (2,770 ) (7.4 ) Business services 126,032 14.3 112,110 13.5 13,922 12.4 Advertising sales 23,484 2.7 23,799 2.9 (315 ) (1.3 ) Other 9,753 1.2 8,007 0.9 1,746 21.8 Total revenues $ 879,632 100.0 $ 832,697 100.0 $ 46,935 5.6 37 Table of Contents Average monthly revenue per unit, excluding the impact of revenues and customers related to legacy NewWave systems, were as follows for 2018 and 2017: Year Ended December 31, 2018 vs. 2017 2018 2017 $ Change % Change Residential data (1) $ 70.86 $ 65.49 $ 5.37 8.2 Residential video (1) $ 87.72 $ 80.49 $ 7.23 9.0 Residential voice (1) $ 34.31 $ 33.54 $ 0.77 2.3 Business services (2) $ 181.65 $ 172.62 $ 9.03 5.2 (1) Average monthly revenue per unit values represent the applicable annual residential service revenues (excluding installation and activation fees) divided by the corresponding average of the number of PSUs at the beginning and end of each year, divided by 12. (2) Average monthly revenue per unit values represent annual business services revenues (excluding installation and activation fees) divided by the average of the number of business customer relationships at the beginning and end of each year, divided by 12. Residential data service revenues increased $76.5 million, or 18.4%, as a result of organic subscriber growth, an additional four months of NewWave operations, a modem rental rate adjustment in the first quarter of 2018, a reduction in package discounting and increased customer subscriptions to premium tiers. Residential video service revenues increased $10.8 million, or 3.3%, due primarily to an additional four months of NewWave operations and a broadcast television surcharge increase implemented in the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by a 10.5% year-over-year decrease in residential video subscribers. Residential voice service revenues decreased $2.5 million, or 5.6%, due primarily to a 9.9% year-over-year decrease in residential voice subscribers, partially offset by an additional four months of NewWave operations. Business services revenues increased $24.9 million, or 19.0%, due primarily to growth in our business data and voice services to small and medium-sized businesses and enterprise customers, an additional four months of NewWave operations and a rate adjustment for business video customers in the first quarter of 2018. Total business customer relationships increased 6.1% year-over-year. Operating Costs and Expenses Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) were $370.3 million for 2018 and increased $33.2 million, or 9.9%, compared to 2017. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 34.5% for 2018 compared to 35.1% for 2017. The increase in operating expenses attributable to the NewWave operations was $30.5 million. Excluding the expenses associated with the NewWave operations, operating expenses would have been $276.6 million for 2018, an increase of $2.7 million, or 1.0%, compared to 2017. The increase was due primarily to higher repairs and maintenance costs of $1.5 million and programming costs of $1.3 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, excluding the impact of the NewWave operations, would have been 31.4% for 2018 compared to 32.9% for 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $17.8 million, or 8.7%, to $222.2 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 20.7% and 21.3% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the NewWave operations was $12.8 million, including $4.6 million for system conversion costs. Excluding the expenses associated with the NewWave operations, selling, general and administrative expenses would have increased $5.0 million, or 2.7%, to $192.8 million due primarily to higher insurance expense of $4.4 million, marketing costs of $2.1 million, rebranding costs of $1.0 million and compensation expense of $0.8 million, partially offset by lower acquisition-related costs of $4.1 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues, excluding the impact of the NewWave operations, would have been 21.9% for 2018 compared to 22.5% for 2017. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $16.1 million, or 8.9%, including an $18.2 million increase attributable to the NewWave operations. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expense was 18.4% for 2018 compared to 18.9% for 2017. We recognized a net loss on asset disposals of $14.2 million in 2018 compared to $0.6 million in 2017. The prior year amount consisted of a $7.2 million net loss on asset disposals and a gain on the sale of a portion of our previous headquarters property of $6.6 million. The year-over-year increase in the net loss on asset disposals was primarily attributable to a write-off of excess equipment and a higher amount of assets retired as new assets replaced them. 38 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense increased $13.6 million, or 28.9%, to $60.4 million due primarily to additional outstanding debt incurred on May 1, 2017 to finance the NewWave acquisition and an increase in interest rates year-over-year. Other Income Other income for 2018 primarily consisted of interest income of $4.6 million. Other income for 2017 primarily consisted of interest income of $1.2 million, partially offset by a $0.6 million write-off of debt issuance costs related to the additional debt incurred to finance the NewWave acquisition. Income Tax Provision (Benefit) The income tax provision was $47.2 million in 2018 compared to an income tax benefit of $45.0 million in 2017. The year-over-year change was due primarily to a one-time reduction of our 2017 net deferred income tax liability as a result of the Federal tax reform legislation passed in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our effective tax rate was 22.3% and (23.7)% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. 2017 Compared to 2016 Revenues Revenues increased $140.6 million, or 17.2%, due primarily to increases in residential data, residential video and business services revenues of $70.8 million, $37.8 million and $31.0 million, respectively. The increase was the result of the NewWave operations since May 1, 2017 and organic growth in our higher margin product lines of residential data and business services, partially offset by a decrease in advertising sales revenues. Revenues by service offering were as follows for 2017 and 2016, together with the percentages of total revenues that each item represented for the years presented (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 vs. 2016 Revenues % of Total Revenues % of Total $ Change % Change Residential data $ 416,355 43.4 $ 345,563 42.2 $ 70,792 20.5 Residential video 332,536 34.6 294,781 36.0 37,755 12.8 Residential voice 43,733 4.6 42,949 5.2 784 1.8 Business services 131,082 13.7 100,034 12.2 31,048 31.0 Advertising sales 24,824 2.6 27,496 3.4 (2,672 ) (9.7 ) Other 11,426 1.1 8,525 1.0 2,901 34.0 Total revenues $ 959,956 100.0 $ 819,348 100.0 $ 140,608 17.2 Average monthly revenue per unit for the indicated service offerings were as follows for 2017 and 2016: Year Ended December 31, 2017 vs. 2016 2017 2016 $ Change % Change Residential data (1) $ 63.28 $ 61.68 $ 1.60 2.6 Residential video (1) $ 81.07 $ 74.84 $ 6.23 8.3 Residential voice (1) $ 33.80 $ 34.29 $ (0.49 ) (1.4 ) Business services (2) $ 177.73 $ 165.92 $ 11.81 7.1 (1) Average monthly revenue per unit values represent the applicable annual residential service revenues (excluding installation and activation fees) divided by the corresponding average of the number of PSUs at the beginning and end of each year, divided by 12, except that for any new PSUs added as a result of an acquisition occurring during the reporting period, the associated average monthly revenue per unit values represent the applicable residential service revenues (excluding installation and activation fees) divided by the pro-rated number of PSUs during such period.

Residential data service revenues increased $70.8 million, or 20.5%, due primarily to an increase in residential data customers of 24.7% year-over-year as a result of the NewWave operations and organic subscriber growth, a reduction in package discounting and increased subscriptions to premium tiers by residential customers. Residential video service revenues increased $37.8 million, or 12.8%, due primarily to an increase in residential video customers of 13.1% as a result of the NewWave operations and a rate adjustment in the first quarter of 2017. Residential voice service revenues increased $0.8 million, or 1.8%, due primarily to an increase in residential voice customers of 12.6% as a result of the NewWave operations, partially offset by a decrease in average monthly revenue per unit. Business services revenues increased $31.0 million, or 31.0%, due primarily to the NewWave operations, growth in our business data and voice services to small and medium-sized businesses and enterprise customers and a rate adjustment for business video customers in the first quarter of 2017. Total business customer relationships increased 29.1% year-over-year. Advertising sales revenues decreased $2.7 million, or 9.7%, due primarily to a decrease in political advertising and fewer video customers to be reached by advertising spots. Other revenues increased $2.9 million, or 34.0%, due primarily to the NewWave operations. Operating Costs and Expenses Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) were $337.0 million in 2017 and increased $40.5 million, or 13.6%, compared to 2016. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 35.1% for 2017 compared to 36.2% for 2016. Additional operating expenses attributable to the NewWave operations were $63.1 million for 2017. This increase was partially offset by a $12.7 million decrease in labor costs associated with our change in accounting for capitalized labor, a $3.8 million decrease in programming costs resulting from fewer video subscribers, a $3.1 million decrease in backbone and internet connectivity fees, a $1.3 million decrease in insurance costs and a $1.0 million decrease in repair and maintenance costs. Excluding the impact of the NewWave operations, operating expenses would have been $273.9 million in 2017, a decrease of $22.7 million, or 7.6%. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, excluding the impact of the NewWave operations, would have been 32.9% in 2017 compared to 36.2% in 2016. 40 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $19.4 million, or 10.5%, to $204.4 million for 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 21.3% and 22.6% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Additional selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the NewWave operations were $16.6 million for 2017. Increases in severance costs of $4.4 million, deferred compensation expenses of $2.4 million and software maintenance costs of $2.1 million were partially offset by a $3.6 million decrease in labor costs associated with the capitalized labor change and a $1.8 million decrease in employee incentive costs. Excluding the incremental expenses associated with the NewWave operations, selling, general and administrative expenses would have increased $2.8 million, or 1.5%, to $187.8 million for 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues, excluding the impact of the NewWave operations, would have been 22.5% in 2017 compared to 22.6% in 2016. Depreciation and amortization increased $33.8 million, or 22.8%, to $181.6 million for 2017 including $32.2 million attributable to the NewWave operations. The increase was due primarily to new assets placed in service in 2017 and 2016, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets acquired as part of the NewWave acquisition, partially offset by assets that became fully depreciated during those years. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expense was 18.9% for 2017 compared to 18.0% for 2016. We recognized a $0.6 million net loss on asset disposals in 2017 compared to $2.8 million in 2016. The net loss in 2017 consisted of a $7.2 million loss on disposals of property, plant and equipment, including $2.1 million associated with damage caused by Hurricane Harvey, partially offset by a $6.6 million gain on the sale of a portion of our previous headquarters property. Interest Expense Interest expense was $46.9 million and $30.2 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase was due primarily to additional debt incurred to finance the NewWave acquisition. Other Income Other income for 2017 primarily consisted of interest income of $1.2 million, partially offset by a $0.6 million write-off of debt issuance costs related to the additional debt incurred to finance the NewWave acquisition. Other income of $5.1 million in 2016 primarily consisted of a $4.1 million net gain on the sale of a cable system and interest income. Income Tax Provision (Benefit) The income tax provision (benefit) decreased $106.7 million, or 173.0%, to a benefit of $45.0 million. The decrease primarily related to a net income tax benefit of $114.0 million associated with a reduction of our net deferred income tax liability as a result of the Federal tax reform legislation passed in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $3.4 million of income tax benefits attributable to equity-based awards recorded throughout 2017. Our effective tax rate was (23.7)% for 2017 and 38.1% for 2016. Use of Adjusted EBITDA We use certain measures that are not defined by GAAP to evaluate various aspects of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as superior to, or as a substitute for, net income reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to net income below. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income plus interest expense, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, severance expense, (gain) loss on deferred compensation, acquisition-related costs, (gain) loss on asset disposals, system conversion costs, rebranding costs, other (income) expense and other unusual operating expenses, as provided in the table below. As such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of our business as well as other non-cash or special items and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. This measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and our cash cost of debt financing. These costs are evaluated through other financial measures. 41 Table of Contents We use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our performance. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generally correlates to the measure used in the leverage ratio calculation under our outstanding Senior Credit Facilities and Notes (each as defined under Financial Condition: Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activity below) to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the Senior Credit Facilities and ability to take certain actions under the Indenture (as defined under Financial Condition: Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activity below) governing the Notes. Adjusted EBITDA is also a significant performance measure used by us in our annual incentive compensation program. Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account cash used for mandatory debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures, and thus does not represent residual funds available for discretionary uses.

(2) Comprised of $4.6 million of billing system conversion costs related to NewWave and $0.4 million of enterprise resource planning system implementation costs. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures with similar titles are common measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Financial Condition: Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Our primary funding requirements are for our ongoing operations, planned capital expenditures, payments of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. We believe that existing cash balances, our Senior Credit Facilities and operating cash flows will provide adequate support for these funding requirements over the next 12 months. However, our ability to fund operations, make planned capital expenditures, pay quarterly dividends and make share repurchases depends on future operating performance and cash flows, which, in turn, are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. 42 Table of Contents The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years indicated (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 407,769 $ 324,486 $ 257,121 Net cash used in investing activities (214,295 ) (891,167 ) (141,607 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (91,113 ) 590,393 (96,673 ) Increase in cash and cash equivalents 102,361 23,712 18,841 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 161,752 138,040 119,199 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 264,113 $ 161,752 $ 138,040 During 2018 and 2017, our cash and cash equivalents increased $102.4 million and $23.7 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $264.1 million and $161.8 million of cash on hand and working capital of $184.2 million and $76.7 million, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities increased $83.3 million in 2018 compared to 2017, which was primarily attributable to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $57.2 million and a decrease in cash tax payments of $57.8 million, partially offset by a $13.7 million increase in cash paid for interest and a $1.6 million difference in changes to net operating assets and liabilities. The change in operating cash flows in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $87.5 million and a decrease in cash income tax payments of $13.4 million, partially offset by an $18.8 million difference in changes to net operating assets and liabilities and a $15.4 million increase in cash paid for interest. Cash used in investing activities during 2018 decreased $676.9 compared to 2017 due primarily to the $727.9 million used to purchase NewWave in 2017, partially offset by the receipt of $10.1 million of proceeds in 2017 from the sale of a non-operating property and a $40.6 million year-over-year increase in capital spending during 2018. The higher use of cash in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to $727.9 million in net cash paid for the NewWave acquisition and a $28.2 million increase in cash paid for capital expenditures. Cash used in financing activities was $91.1 million and $96.7 million in 2018 and 2016, respectively, and cash provided by financing activities was $590.4 million in 2017. Cash outflows in 2018 primarily related to $42.9 million of dividends paid to stockholders, $26.6 million of common stock repurchases, $14.4 million of long-term debt repayments and $7.2 million of withholding tax payments associated with equity award vesting and exercise activities. Cash inflows in 2017 were primarily attributable to $750.0 million of new debt incurred in connection with the NewWave acquisition, partially offset by long term debt payments, including a $93.8 million term loan repayment, $37.2 million of dividends paid to stockholders, a $15.2 million payment of debt issuance costs and $5.0 million of withholding tax payments associated with equity award vesting and exercise activities. Cash outflows in 2016 primarily consisted of $56.4 million for common stock repurchases, $34.4 million of dividends paid to stockholders, $3.8 million of long-term debt repayments and $2.2 million of withholding tax payments for vested restricted stock awards. On July 1, 2015, the Board authorized up to $250.0 million of share repurchases (subject to a total cap of 600,000 shares of our common stock). Purchases under the share repurchase program may be made from time to time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions. The size and timing of these purchases are based on a number of factors, including share price and business and market conditions. Since the inception of the share repurchase program through the end of 2018, we have repurchased 204,647 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $99.8 million. During 2018, we repurchased 38,814 shares at an aggregate cost of $26.6 million. We currently expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of our common stock, subject to approval of the Board. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Board approved a quarterly dividend of $2.00 per share of common stock, which was paid on December 7, 2018. On February 5, 2019, the Board approved a quarterly dividend of $2.00 per share of common stock to be paid on March 8, 2019 to holders of record as of February 19, 2019. Financing Activity On June 17, 2015, we issued $450 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the Notes ) pursuant to an indenture (the Indenture ) dated as of June 17, 2015. The Notes mature on June 15, 2022 and interest is payable on June 15th and December 15th of each year. The Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis (the Guarantees ) by each of our subsidiaries that guaranteed the Senior Credit Facilities (the Guarantors ). In addition, if a subsidiary of the Company becomes a guarantor in respect of the Senior Credit Facilities or certain other indebtedness, it is required to provide (subject to customary exceptions) a Guarantee in respect of the Notes. The Notes are unsecured and senior obligations of the Company. The Guarantees are unsecured and senior obligations of the Guarantors. At our option, we may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at the redemption prices specified in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but excluding) the redemption date. The Indenture includes certain covenants relating to debt incurrence, liens, restricted payments, asset sales, transactions with affiliates, changes in control and mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets. The Indenture also provides for customary events of default (subject, in certain cases, to customary grace periods), which include nonpayment on the Notes, breach of covenants in the Indenture, payment defaults or acceleration of other indebtedness over a specified threshold, failure to pay certain judgments over a specified threshold and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the trustee under the Indenture or holders of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal of, and accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. 43 Table of Contents On June 30, 2015, we entered into a Credit Agreement among the Company, as borrower, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( JPMorgan ), as administrative agent, and the other agents party thereto. The Credit Agreement provided for a five-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million (the Revolving Credit Facility ) and a five-year term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $100 million (the Original Term Loan Facility and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Original Credit Facilities ). Concurrently with our entry into the Credit Agreement, we borrowed the full amount of the Original Term Loan Facility (the Original Term Loan ). Borrowings under the Original Credit Facilities bore interest, at our option, at a rate per annum determined by reference to either the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) or an adjusted base rate, in each case plus an applicable interest rate margin. The applicable interest rate margin with respect to LIBOR borrowings was a rate per annum between 1.50% and 2.25% and the applicable interest rate margin with respect to adjusted base rate borrowings was a rate per annum between 0.50% and 1.25%, in each case determined on a quarterly basis by reference to a pricing grid based upon our total net leverage ratio. In addition, we are required to pay commitment fees on any unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate between 0.25% per annum and 0.40% per annum, determined by reference to the pricing grid. The Revolving Credit Facility also gives us the ability to issue letters of credit, which reduce the amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility. Letter of credit issuances under the Revolving Credit Facility of $4.1 million at December 31, 2018 were held for the benefit of certain general and liability insurance matters and bore interest at a rate of 1.88% per annum at December 31, 2018. We had $195.9 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2018. On May 1, 2017, we entered into a Restatement Agreement (the Restatement Agreement ) with JPMorgan, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, pursuant to which we amended and restated the Credit Agreement (as so amended and restated, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ) and incurred $750.0 million of senior secured loans (the 2017 New Loans ), which were used, together with cash on hand, to (i) finance the NewWave acquisition, (ii) repay in full the Original Term Loan and (iii) pay related fees and expenses. The 2017 New Loans consist of (a) a five-year incremental term A loan in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million (the Term Loan A ) and (b) a seven-year incremental term B loan in an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million (the Term Loan B and, together with the Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Credit Facilities ). The obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiaries and are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all assets of the Company and the Guarantors. On April 23, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Repricing Amendment ) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to, among other things, decrease the applicable margin for the Term Loan B to 1.75% for LIBOR borrowings and 0.75% for base rate borrowings. The interest margins applicable to the 2017 New Loans under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are, at our option, equal to either LIBOR or a base rate, plus an applicable margin equal to, (i) with respect to the Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility, 1.50% to 2.25% for LIBOR loans and 0.50% to 1.25% for base rate loans, determined on a quarterly basis by reference to a pricing grid based on our total net leverage ratio and (ii) with respect to the Term Loan B, (x) for any date on or prior to April 22, 2018, 2.25% for LIBOR loans and 1.25% for base rate loans and (y) for any day thereafter, 1.75% for LIBOR loans and 0.75% for base rate loans. The Term Loan A may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium (subject to customary LIBOR breakage provisions) and amortizes in equal quarterly installments at a rate (expressed as a percentage of the original principal amount) of 2.5% per annum for the first year after funding, 5.0% per annum for the second year after funding, 7.5% per annum for the third year after funding and 10.0% per annum for the fourth and fifth years after funding (subject to customary adjustments in the event of any prepayment), with the outstanding balance due upon maturity. The Term Loan B amortizes in equal quarterly installments at a rate (expressed as a percentage of the original principal amount) of 1.0% per annum (subject to customary adjustments in the event of repayment), with the outstanding balance due upon maturity. The Term Loan B may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium (subject to customary LIBOR breakage provisions), benefits from certain most favored nation pricing protections and is not subject to the financial maintenance covenants under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. 44 Table of Contents We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan A and Term Loan B were $237.5 million and $492.5 million, respectively, and each bore interest at a rate of 4.28% per annum. In connection with the Repricing Amendment, we incurred debt issuance costs of $2.1 million, of which $0.1 million was expensed immediately. We recorded $4.2 million, $3.2 million and $1.6 million of debt issuance cost amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Unamortized debt issuance costs totaled $17.6 million and $19.6 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. On January 7, 2019, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with CoBank, ACB, as lender, and JPMorgan, as administrative agent, to provide for a new seven-year incremental term B loan in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million (the Term B-2 Loan ). The net proceeds from the Term B-2 Loan were used to finance, in part, our acquisition of Clearwave. The Term B-2 Loan is an obligation of ours and is guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiaries that guarantee our other obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Term B-2 Loan is secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors. The interest margin applicable to the Term B-2 Loan is, at our option, equal to either LIBOR or a base rate, plus an applicable margin equal to 2.0% for LIBOR loans and 1.0% for base rate loans. The Term B-2 Loan may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium (subject to customary LIBOR breakage provisions) and is not subject to the financial maintenance covenants under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Term B-2 Loan amortizes in equal quarterly installments at a rate (expressed as a percentage of the original principal amount) of 1.0% per annum (subject to customary adjustments in the event of any prepayment), with the outstanding balance due upon maturity. The final maturity of the Term B-2 Loan may be accelerated following an event of default under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Other than with respect to maturity, amortization, prepayment premiums and pricing, the Term B-2 Loan contains terms that are substantially similar to our existing Term Loan B. Capital Expenditures We have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements. In addition, we expect to spend up to $35 million during 2019, in addition to the combined nearly $27 million spent for NewWave in 2018 and 2017, to enhance acquired operations by rebuilding low capacity markets, launching all-digital video services, implementing 32-channel bonding, converting back office functions such as billing, accounting and service provisioning, migrating products to legacy Cable One platforms and expanding our high-capacity fiber network. Capital expenditures are funded primarily by cash on hand and cash flows from operating activities. We have adopted capital expenditure disclosure guidance as supported by the NCTA The Internet & Television Association ( NCTA ). These disclosures are not required under GAAP, nor do they impact our accounting for capital expenditures under GAAP. The amounts of capital expenditures reported in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are calculated in accordance with NCTA disclosure guidelines. The following table presents our capital expenditures by category in accordance with NCTA disclosure guidelines for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Customer premise equipment $ 56,500 $ 37,071 $ 22,248 Commercial 9,832 9,595 8,257 Scalable infrastructure 46,176 40,122 41,017 Line extensions 16,381 15,947 10,470 Upgrade/rebuild 30,081 19,186 17,575 Support capital 58,796 57,442 31,257 Total $ 217,766 $ 179,363 $ 130,824 45 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingent Commitments The following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Year E nding December 31, Programming Purchase Commitments (1) Operating Lease Payments Debt Payments (2) Other Purchase Obligations (3) Total 2019 $ 201,894 $ 1,767 $ 20,625 $ 24,385 $ 248,671 2020 160,489 1,219 26,892 17,095 205,695 2021 88,872 911 30,017 9,560 129,360 2022 8,910 398 630,017 2,760 642,085 2023 6,162 204 5,017 1,581 12,964 Thereafter 3,726 299 467,683 3,648 475,356 Total $ 470,053 $ 4,798 $ 1,180,251 $ 59,029 $ 1,714,131 (1) Programming purchase commitments represent contracts that we have with cable television networks and broadcast stations to provide programming services to our subscribers. The amounts reported represent estimates of the future programming costs for these purchase commitments based on tier placement as of December 31, 2018 and the estimated subscriber numbers applied to the per-subscriber rates contained in these contracts. Actual amounts due under such contracts may differ from the amounts above based on the actual subscriber numbers and tier placements at the time. In addition, programming purchases sometimes occur pursuant to non-binding commitments, which are not reflected in the amounts shown. (2) Debt payments include principal repayment obligations as defined by the agreements described in the Financing Activity section and capital lease payment obligations. (3) Other purchase obligations include purchase obligations related to capital projects and other legally binding commitments. Other purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the amounts shown. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are included within accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We incur the following costs as part of our operations, however, they are not included within the contractual obligations table above for the reasons discussed below: We rent space on utility poles in order to provide our services to certain subscribers. Generally, pole rentals are cancellable on short notice. However, we anticipate that such rentals will recur. Rent expense for pole attachments was $8.9 million, $7.8 million and $5.7 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We pay fees to franchise authorities under multi-year franchise agreements based on a percentage of revenues generated from video service each year. Franchise fees and other franchise-related costs are included in both revenues and operating expenses within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Such amounts totaled $16.1 million, $15.7 million and $14.2 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We have franchise agreements requiring plant construction and the provision of services to customers within the franchise areas. In connection with these obligations under existing franchise agreements, we obtain surety bonds or letters of credit guaranteeing performance to municipalities and public utilities and payment of insurance premiums. Such surety bonds and letters of credit totaled $13.3 million and $12.0 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Payments under these arrangements are required only in the remote event of nonperformance. We do not expect that these contingent commitments will result in any amounts being paid. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of the items discussed within the preceding Contractual Obligations and Contingent Commitments section, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or financing arrangements with special-purpose entities. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 46 Table of Contents An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to our results of operations and financial condition and if it requires management most difficult, subjective and complex judgments in its application. For a summary of all our significant accounting policies, see note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Long-lived Assets A long-lived asset or asset group is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment may include: a significant decrease in the market value of the asset; a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant change in the physical condition of the asset; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset; a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with an asset; and a current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. When an indicator of impairment is determined, the first step is to identify the future intent of the asset or asset group: hold for continued use, hold for sale, or dispose by a means other than sale. If the asset is held for continued use and the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted sum of cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposition of the property, the impairment loss is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group, and the new cost basis is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset. If the intent is to hold the asset for sale and certain other criteria are met (e.g., the asset can be disposed of currently, appropriate levels of authority have approved the sale, and there is an active program to locate a buyer), the impairment test involves comparing the asset carrying value to its estimated fair value less disposal costs. To the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset estimated fair value less disposal costs, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference. If the asset is to be disposed by a means other than sale, the depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life. Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether an event has occurred, determining the future cash flows for the assets involved and selecting the appropriate discount rate to be applied in determining estimated fair value. Goodw ill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We have a significant amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that are reviewed at least annually for impairment. These balances were as follows (dollars in thousands): As of December 31, 2018 2017 Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets $ 984,500 $ 984,266 Total assets $ 2,303,234 $ 2,204,632 Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as a percentage of total assets 42.7 % 44.6 % Goodwill . Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from anticipated synergies and intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition, including assembled workforce, noncontractual relationships and other agreements. We assess the recoverability of our goodwill as of November 30th of each year, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. To determine our reporting units, we evaluate the components one level below the segment level and we aggregate the components if they have similar economic characteristics. As a result of this assessment, our reporting units are established at the geographic division level. We evaluate the determination of our reporting units used to test for impairment periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. The quantitative assessment considers whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Any excess amount is recorded as an impairment charge in the current period (limited to the amount of goodwill recorded). We elected to perform a quantitative assessment for our goodwill in 2018, for which the fair value of each geographic reporting unit was determined by applying a calculated multiple from our peer group companies to each reporting unit forecasted cash flow. Based on the assessment, we concluded that the fair value of goodwill for each geographic reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. We did not record any impairment of goodwill in any of the periods presented. 47 Table of Contents Ind efinite-Lived Intangible Assets . Intangible assets with an indefinite life are from franchise agreements that we have with state and local governments allowing us to contract and operate our business within a specified geographic area. We expect our franchise agreements to provide us with substantial benefit for a period that extends beyond the foreseeable horizon, and we have historically obtained renewals and extensions of such agreements without material modifications to the agreements for nominal costs, and these costs are expensed as incurred. We group the recorded values of our various franchise agreements into geographic divisions or units of account. We assess the recoverability of our indefinite-lived intangible assets as of November 30th of each year, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. We evaluate the unit of account used to test for impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur to ensure impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. When performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily based on a multi-period excess earnings method ( MPEEM ) analysis that involves significant judgment. When analyzing the fair values indicated under the MPEEM analysis, we also consider multiples of Adjusted EBITDA generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions, and profitability information. If the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than the carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets. We performed a qualitative assessment of our franchise assets in 2018. Based on the assessment, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of franchise assets in each unit of account exceeded the carrying value of such assets and, therefore, we did not perform a quantitative analysis. We did not recognize any impairment charges in any of the periods presented. Property, Plant and Equipment Our industry is capital intensive, and a significant portion of our resources is spent on capital activities associated with extending, rebuilding and upgrading our network. The following tables present certain information regarding our net property, plant and equipment and our cash paid for property, plant and equipment for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): As of December 31, 2018 2017 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 847,979 $ 831,892 Total assets $ 2,303,234 $ 2,204,632 Property, plant and equipment, net as a percentage of total assets 36.8 % 37.7 % Year Ended December 31, Cash Paid for Property, Plant and Equipment 2018 $ 215,761 2017 $ 175,196 2016 $ 147,014 48 Table of Contents Property, plant and equipment represents the costs incurred in the design, construction and implementation of plant, infrastructure and capacity improvements and upgrades. Costs associated with the installation and upgrade of services and the acquiring and deploying of customer premise equipment, including materials, internal and external labor costs and related indirect and overhead costs, are also capitalized. Indirect and overhead costs include payroll taxes, insurance and other benefits and vehicle, tool and supply expense related to installation activities. Capitalized labor costs include the direct costs of engineers and technical managers involved in the design and implementation of plant and infrastructure, the costs of technicians involved in the installation and upgrades of services and customer premise equipment, and the costs of support personnel directly involved in capitalizable activities, such as project managers and supervisors. Internal labor costs capitalized for engineering and technical personnel are based on standards developed by position for the percentage of time spent on capitalized projects while internal labor costs associated with installation and other plant activities are based on standards developed from operational data. Overhead costs are capitalized based on standards developed from historical information. Costs for repairs and maintenance, disconnecting service or reconnecting service are expensed as incurred. The estimated useful lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances warrant and such lives are revised to the extent necessary due to changing facts and circumstances. Any changes in estimated useful lives are reflected prospectively.
