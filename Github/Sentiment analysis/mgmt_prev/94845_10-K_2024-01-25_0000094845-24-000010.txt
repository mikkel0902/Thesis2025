Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors for a discussion of forward-looking statements and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements. We use a 52- or 53-week fiscal year, with each fiscal year ending on the Sunday that is closest to November 30 of that year. See Financial Information Presentation Fiscal Year. This Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. To supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures throughout this Annual Report, as described further below, to provide investors with additional useful information about our financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance from management view and because we believe they provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry. However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, our consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Overview We are an iconic American company with a rich history of profitable growth, quality, innovation and corporate citizenship. Our story began in San Francisco, California, in 1853 as a wholesale dry goods business. We created the first riveted blue jean 20 years later. Today we design, market and sell products that include jeans, casual and dress pants, tops, shorts, skirts, dresses, jackets, footwear and related accessories for men, women and children around the world under our Levi , Dockers , Signature by Levi Strauss & Co. and Denizen brands. We service our consumers through our global infrastructure which develops, sources and markets our products around the world. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired Beyond Yoga , which is a premium athletic and lifestyle apparel brand. We operate our business according to three reportable segments: Americas, Europe, and Asia, collectively comprising our Levi's Brands business, which includes the Levi's, Signature by Levi Strauss & Co. and Denizen brands. The Dockers and Beyond Yoga businesses do not meet the quantitative thresholds for reportable segments and therefore are presented in our financial statements under the caption of Other Brands. Our iconic, enduring brands are brought to life every day around the world by our talented and creative employees and partners. The Levi brand epitomizes classic, authentic American style and effortless cool. We have cultivated Levi as a lifestyle brand that is inclusive and democratic in the eyes of consumers while offering products that feel exclusive, personalized and original. This approach has enabled the Levi brand to evolve with the times and continually reach a new, younger audience, while our rich heritage continues to drive relevance and appeal across demographics. The Dockers brand helped drive Casual Friday in the 1990s and has been a cornerstone of casual menswear for more than 30 years. Seen as the khaki leader, Dockers has returned to its California roots and is bringing a full range of casual, versatile styles for men and women to show up with cool confidence every day. The Signature by Levi Strauss & Co. and Denizen brands, which we developed for value-conscious consumers, offer quality craftsmanship and great fit and style at affordable prices. The Beyond Yoga brand is a body positive, premium athleisure apparel brand focused on quality, fit and comfort. We recognize wholesale revenue from sales of our products through third-party retailers such as department stores, specialty retailers, third-party e-commerce sites and franchise locations dedicated to our brands. We also sell our products directly to consumers through a variety of formats, including our own company-operated mainline and outlet stores, company- 43 Table of Contents operated e-commerce sites and select shop-in-shops that we operate within department stores and other third-party retail locations. As of November 26, 2023, our products were sold in over 45,000 retail locations in more than 110 countries, including approximately 3,200 brand-dedicated stores and shop-in-shops. As of November 26, 2023, we had company-operated stores located in 37 countries and approximately 550 company-operated shop-in-shops. The remainder of our brand-dedicated stores and shop-in-shops were operated by franchisees and other partners. Across all of our brands, pants including jeans, casual pants, dress pants, shorts, skirts, and activewear represented 68% and 67% of our total units sold in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Tops including shirts, sweaters, jackets, dresses and jumpsuits represented 26% of our total units sold in both fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2022. The remainder of our products are footwear and accessories. Men's products generated 64% and 65% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Women's products generated 34% and 33% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The remainder of our products are non-gendered. Products other than denim bottoms which include tops, footwear and accessories and pants excluding jeans represented 39% and 38% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our Europe and Asia businesses, collectively, contributed 43% of our net revenues and 46% of our segment operating income in fiscal year 2023, as compared to 41% of our net revenues and 41% of our segment operating income in fiscal year 2022. Revenues from our international business, which includes our Europe and Asia segments, as well as Canada and Latin America from our Americas segment, represented 56% of our net revenues in fiscal year 2023, as compared to 53% in fiscal year 2022. Sales of Levi brand products represented approximately 87% of our net revenues in both fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2022. Our wholesale channel generated 57% and 62% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our DTC channel generated 43% and 38% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, with our company operated e-commerce business representing 20% and 19% of DTC channel net revenues and 9% and 7% of total net revenues in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our global digital business, which includes our e-commerce sites as well as the online business of our wholesale customers, including that of traditional wholesalers as well as pure-play (online-only) wholesalers represent approximately 21% and 22% of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our key long-term objectives are to strengthen our brands globally in order to deliver sustainable profitable growth and generate industry-leading shareholder returns. Critical strategies to achieve these objectives include being a brand-led business, putting DTC first, and further diversifying across geographies, categories, genders and channels. We intend to achieve these strategies through operational excellence, financial discipline, and the digital transformation of our business processes and ways of working, including continuing to invest in key omni-channel capabilities, digital tools across the business and updating our ERP system. Supply Chain and U.S. Distribution Center Capacity Constraints During fiscal 2023, inventory levels in our U.S. distribution centers sequentially improved from the elevated levels experienced during the latter half of the prior year. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, inventory decreased 7% on a unit basis and 9% on a dollar basis. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2023, we modified terms with the majority of our suppliers to take ownership of our inventory near the point of shipment rather than destination, which contributed approximately $110 million, or 8% of growth on a dollar basis, to the decrease in inventory versus the prior year period. Additionally, inflationary pressures, competition for, and price volatility of, resources throughout the supply chain have increased, resulting in higher labor and raw material costs. Trends such as these have and may continue to result in higher product costs and increased pressure to reduce costs and raise product prices, which could have a negative impact on demand. We continue to pursue mitigation strategies and create new efficiencies in our global supply chain. Effects of Inflation Inflationary pressures have negatively impacted our revenue, operating margins and net income in fiscal years 2022 and 2023, including increased costs of labor, products and freight, and beginning in July 2022, a slowdown in consumer demand for our products. We implemented price increases on many of our products in the latter half of 2022 in an effort to mitigate the effect of higher costs. If these inflationary pressures continue, our revenue, gross and operating margins and net income will be impacted in 2024. Impact of Russia-Ukraine Crisis on our Business As a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we suspended our business initiatives and the majority of our commercial activity in Russia and Ukraine in the second quarter of 2022. This included the closure of the majority of our company-operated stores in Russia, as well as the suspension of shipments to our wholesale and licensing customers in Russia and Ukraine. In 44 Table of Contents response to this crisis, the United States and other countries have implemented economic and other sanctions. These sanctions currently, and any additional sanctions may in the future, impact our ability to conduct business in Russia. Given the high level of uncertainty surrounding the future operations of our business in Russia, including the ability to generate future cash flows, the carrying value of our long-lived assets specific to our commercial business in Russia were deemed to be not recoverable. As a result of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, during the second quarter of 2022, we recorded total charges of $60.4 million. The charges reflect the full impairment of long-lived assets, including $35.4 million related to certain store right-of-use assets, $11.6 million related to goodwill and $4.1 million related to property, plant and equipment, as well as $9.3 million of other incremental charges. During the second half of 2022, we recognized a $15.8 million gain related to the early termination of certain store lease agreements related to the Russia-Ukraine crisis. All charges are included in selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, all of our company-operated stores were closed and substantially all commercial activity in Russia had ceased. For the year ended November 26, 2023, the results of operations for our businesses in Russia and Ukraine were not material to our consolidated financial statements. However, the impact to our Europe segment was an approximate $54 million decrease in net revenues on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year, of which $9 million was related to wholesale and $45 million was related to DTC. In comparison to the prior year quarter, the impact to our Europe segment was an approximate $14 million decrease in net revenues on a constant currency basis, of which $8 million was related to wholesale and $6 million was related to DTC. Net revenues from Russia represented approximately 2% of our total net revenues for fiscal year 2021. There is still uncertainty regarding the extent to which the war and its broader macroeconomic implications will impact our Europe segment and overall business, financial condition and results of operations. Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business During fiscal year 2023, our company-operated stores and wholesale customer doors were open. In fiscal year 2022, strict lockdowns and zero-tolerance policy shutdowns in China resulted in temporary store closures and reduced traffic throughout the country. Across the rest of our markets, most of our company-operated stores and wholesale customer doors were open throughout fiscal year 2022. Global Productivity Initiative In first quarter of 2024, our Board of Directors (the "Board") endorsed a multi-year global productivity initiative, Project Fuel designed to accelerate the execution of our Brand Led and DTC First strategies while fueling long-term profitable growth. This will be a two-year initiative beginning in 2024, with a focus on optimizing our operating model and structure, redesigning business processes and identifying opportunities to reduce costs and simplify processes across our organization. In fiscal year 2024, we expect that this initiative will generate net cost savings of approximately $100 million. The first phase of the global productivity initiative is expected to occur in the first half of 2024 and is expected to include a 10 - 15% reduction in positions within our global corporate workforce. As a result, in the first quarter of 2024, we expect to record estimated pre-tax restructuring charges of $110 million to $120 million. We may incur additional significant restructuring charges as we progress our global productivity initiative, which could be material in a future fiscal quarter or year. Other Factors Affecting Our Business We believe the other key business and marketplace factors that are impacting our business include the following: Inflation and other macroeconomic pressures in the U.S. and the global economy such as rising interest rates, energy prices and recession fears are creating a complex and challenging retail environment for us and our customers as consumers reduce discretionary spending. A decline in consumer spending has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our revenues, operating margins and net income. Challenges forecasting consumer demand has and may continue to lead to elevated inventory levels both with us and our customers, resulting in fewer full-priced sales and a more promotional environment. Additionally, elevated inventory levels, combined with the uneven flow of receipts and shipments is causing further capacity pressures within our U.S. distribution centers, resulting in higher costs and limiting our ability to fulfill our customer demand. These trends have impacted and may continue to impact our financial results, affecting inventory, revenue, operating margins and net income. 45 Table of Contents Consumer expectations and related competitive pressures have increased and are expected to continue to increase relative to various aspects of our e-commerce business, including speed of product delivery, shipping charges, return privileges, and other evolving expectations. We continue to invest in our online platforms, information systems, digital, data and AI capabilities, as well as in personnel to support the creation of a fully integrated omni-channel shopping experience. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully meet these expectations which may impact our financial results. The diversification of our business model across geographies, channels, brands, and categories affects our gross margin. For example, if our sales in higher gross margin geographies, channels, brands and categories grow at a faster rate than in our lower gross margin business geographies, channels, brands and categories, we would expect a favorable impact to aggregate gross margin over time. Gross margin in our Europe segment is generally higher than in our Americas and Asia segments. Value brands, which are focused on the value-conscious consumer, generally generate lower gross margin. DTC sales generally have higher gross margins than sales through third parties, although DTC sales also typically have higher selling expenses. As we continue to execute on our strategic framework to be DTC first, we expect to see greater impact on our gross margins. Enhancements to our existing product offerings, or our expansion into new brands and products categories, may also impact our future gross margin. Foreign currencies continue to be volatile. Significant fluctuations of the U.S. Dollar against various foreign currencies, including the Euro, Mexican Peso, and British Pound, may negatively impact our financial results, revenue, operating margins and net income. The current domestic and international political environment, including volatile trade relations, the conflict involving Russia and Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas war, and civil unrest taking place in certain parts of the world have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy. There is greater uncertainty with respect to potential changes in trade regulations, sanctions and export controls which also increase volatility in the global economy. Such changes may require us to modify our current sourcing practices, which may impact our product costs, and, if not mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The OECD reached agreement among various countries to implement a minimum 15% tax rate on certain multinational enterprises, commonly referred to as Pillar Two. Many countries continue to announce changes in their tax laws and regulations based on the Pillar Two proposals. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of these proposed and enacted legislative changes as new guidance becomes available. Some of these legislative changes could impact our effective tax rate and tax liabilities. Given the numerous proposed tax law changes and the uncertainty regarding such proposed legislative changes, the impact of Pillar Two cannot be determined at this time. As climate change evolves, we expect an increase in both the frequency and severity of seasonal and severe weather events, which may affect our consumer traffic and demand, as well as the activities of our suppliers, manufacturers, and customers. Weather events, such as droughts, heatwaves, floods, wildfires and winter storms could impact store traffic and conversion as the timing for seasonal products may be unpredictable. Additionally, weather events could impact the cost or availability of raw materials integral to our products such as cotton. There has been increased focus from our stakeholders, including consumers, employees and investors, and more recently regulatory organizations on corporate environmental, social, and governance ( ESG ) practices, including corporate practices related to the causes and impacts of climate change and corporate statements, practices or products related to a variety of social issues. We expect that stakeholder expectations and actions with respect to ESG practices and social issues will continue to evolve rapidly, which may negatively impact our financial results, and which may necessitate additional resources to monitor, report on, and adjust our operations. Wholesaler/retailer dynamics and wholesale channels remain challenged by mixed growth prospects due to increased competition from e-commerce shopping, pricing transparency enabled by the proliferation of online technologies, and vertically-integrated specialty stores. Retailers, including our top customers, have in the past and may in the future decide to consolidate, undergo restructurings or rationalize their stores, which could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry our products. These factors contribute to a global market environment of intense competition, constant product innovation and continuing cost pressure, and combine with the continuing global economic conditions to create a challenging commercial and economic environment. We evaluate these factors as we develop and execute our strategies. 46 Table of Contents Seasonality of Sales We typically achieve our largest quarterly revenues in the fourth quarter. In fiscal year 2023, our net revenues in the first, second, third and fourth quarters represented 27%, 22%, 24% and 27%, respectively, of our total net revenues for the year. In fiscal year 2022, our net revenues in the first, second, third and fourth quarters represented 26%, 24%, 24% and 26%, respectively, of our total net revenues for the year. We typically achieve a significant amount of revenues from our DTC channel on the Friday following Thanksgiving Day, which is commonly referred to as Black Friday. Due to the timing of our fiscal year end, a particular fiscal year might include one, two or no Black Fridays, which could impact our net revenues for the fiscal year. Fiscal years 2023 and 2022 included one Black Friday. The level of our working capital reflects the seasonality of our business and varies throughout the year to support our seasonal and holiday revenue patterns as well as business trends. 47 Table of Contents Our Results for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2023 Net revenues. Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, consolidated net revenues increased 3.4% on a reported basis and 1.8% on a constant-currency basis. Excluding the effects of currency, revenue growth was driven by DTC, which grew across our regions and brands. The growth was offset with a decline in wholesale, as growth in the U.S. and Asia was offset by a decline in Europe. Operating income . Compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, consolidated operating income increased 10.4% to $151.2 million from $137.0 million. The increase was due to higher gross margin in the current year partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses. Net income. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, consolidated net income of $126.8 million decreased from $150.6 million. The decrease was primarily due to higher SG&A expenses and income tax expense, partially offset by higher gross margin in the current year. Adjusted EBIT. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, Adjusted EBIT of $200.1 million increased from $142.3 million. The increase was due to higher Adjusted gross margin in the current year. Adjusted net income. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, Adjusted net income of $178.6 million increased from $136.6 million. The increase was primarily due to the higher Adjusted EBIT described above. Diluted earnings per share. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, diluted earnings per share of $0.32 decreased from $0.38 due to lower net income described above, partially offset by a decrease in weighted-average common shares outstanding. Adjusted diluted earnings per share. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.44 increased from $0.34 mainly due to the increase in Adjusted net income described above. Inventory. Compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, inventory as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 has decreased 9% primarily due to planned inventory reduction. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2023, we modified terms with the majority of our suppliers to take ownership of our inventory near the point of shipment rather than destination, which contributed approximately $110 million, or 8% of growth on a dollar basis, to the decrease in inventory versus the prior year period. Our Fiscal Year 2023 Results Net revenues. Compared to fiscal year 2022, consolidated net revenues increased 0.2% on a both a reported basis and constant-currency basis. The increase was driven by growth in DTC and in Asia as a result of higher traffic and demand in the current year, offset by declines in wholesale, primarily in the U.S. Operating income . Compared to fiscal year 2022, consolidated operating income decreased to $353.3 million from $646.5 million primarily due to higher SG&A expenses, and goodwill and other intangible impairment charges in the current year. Net income. Compared to fiscal year 2022, consolidated net income decreased to $249.6 million from $569.1 million. The decrease was due to lower operating income described above partially offset by lower income tax expense in the current year. Adjusted EBIT. Compared to fiscal year 2022, Adjusted EBIT of $554.8 million decreased from $713.0 million primarily due to higher Adjusted SG&A expenses, driven by selling expenses in support of our DTC business. Adjusted EBIT margin was 9.0%, 260 basis points lower than the prior year on a reported basis and 270 basis points lower on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted net income. Compared to fiscal year 2022, Adjusted net income decreased to $440.7 million from $603.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower Adjusted EBIT described above. Diluted earnings per share. Compared to fiscal year 2022, diluted earnings per share of $0.62 decreased from $1.41 mainly due to the lower net income described above partially offset by a decrease in weighted-average common shares. Adjusted diluted earnings per share. Compared to fiscal year 2022, Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.10 decreased from $1.50 due to the lower Adjusted net income described above offset by a decrease in weighted-average common shares outstanding. Currency translation favorably affected Adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.05. 48 Table of Contents For more information on Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share, measures not prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, and reconciliations of such measures to net income and diluted earnings per share, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Financial Information Presentation Fiscal year . We use a 52- or 53-week fiscal year, with each fiscal year ending on the Sunday that is closest to November 30 of that year. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries have fiscal years ending November 30. Each fiscal year generally consists of four 13-week quarters, with each quarter ending on the Sunday that is closest to the last day of the last month of that quarter. Fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were 52-week years, ending on November 26, 2023 and November 27, 2022, respectively, and each quarter of fiscal years 2023 and 2022 consisted of 13 weeks. Segments . Our Levi's Brands business, which includes Levi's , Signature by Levi Strauss & Co. and Denizen brands, is defined by geographical regions into three segments: Americas, Europe and Asia. Our Dockers and Beyond Yoga businesses are managed separately and do not meet the quantitative thresholds of a reportable operating segment and are reported in our financial statements under the caption of Other Brands. Classification . Our classification of certain significant revenues and expenses reflects the following: Net revenues comprise net sales and licensing revenues. Net sales include sales of products to wholesale customers, including franchised stores, and direct sales to consumers at our company-operated stores and shop-in-shops located within department stores and other third-party locations, as well as company-operated e-commerce sites. Net revenues include discounts, allowances for estimated returns and incentives. Licensing revenues, which include revenues from the use of our trademarks in connection with the manufacturing, advertising and distribution of trademarked products by third-party licensees, are earned and recognized as products are sold by licensees based on royalty rates as set forth in the applicable licensing agreements. Cost of goods sold primarily comprises product costs, labor and related overhead, sourcing costs, inbound freight, internal transfers and the cost of operating our manufacturing facilities, including the related depreciation expense. On both a reported and constant-currency basis, cost of goods sold reflects the transactional currency impact resulting from the purchase of products in a currency other than the functional currency. Selling expenses include, among other things, all occupancy costs and depreciation associated with our company-operated stores and commissions associated with our company-operated shop-in-shops, as well as costs associated with our e-commerce operations. We reflect substantially all distribution costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, including costs related to receiving and inspection at distribution centers, warehousing, shipping to our customers, handling, and certain other activities associated with our distribution network. 49 Table of Contents Results of Operations A discussion regarding our results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 is presented below. A discussion regarding our results of operations for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 can be found under Item 7 Management Discussion and Analysis in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 27, 2022, filed with the SEC on January 25, 2023. The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, our consolidated statements of income, the changes in these items from period to period and these items expressed as a percentage of net revenues: Year Ended November 26, 2023 November 27, 2022 % Increase (Decrease) November 26, 2023 November 27, 2022 % of Net Revenues % of Net Revenues (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Net revenues $ 6,179.0 $ 6,168.6 0.2 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 2,663.3 2,619.8 1.7 % 43.1 % 42.5 % Gross profit 3,515.7 3,548.8 (0.9) % 56.9 % 57.5 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,072.2 2,890.7 6.3 % 49.7 % 46.9 % Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 90.2 11.6 * 1.5 % 0.2 % Operating income 353.3 646.5 (45.4) % 5.7 % 10.5 % Interest expense (45.9) (25.7) (78.6) % (0.7) % (0.4) % Other (expense) income, net (42.2) 28.8 * (0.7) % 0.5 % Income before income taxes 265.2 649.6 (59.2) % 4.3 % 10.5 % Income tax expense 15.6 80.5 (80.6) % 0.3 % 1.3 % Net income $ 249.6 $ 569.1 (56.1) % 4.0 % 9.2 % Earnings per common share attributable to common stockholders: Basic $ 0.63 $ 1.43 (55.9) % * * Diluted $ 0.62 $ 1.41 (56.0) % * * Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions): Basic 397.2 397.3 % * * Diluted 401.7 403.8 (0.5) % * * _____________ * Not meaningful 50 Table of Contents Net revenues The following table presents net revenues for the periods indicated, and the changes in net revenues on both reported and constant-currency bases from period to period: Year Ended % Increase (Decrease) November 26, 2023 November 27, 2022 As Reported Constant Currency (Dollars in millions) Net revenues: Levi's Brands: Americas $ 3,086.9 $ 3,187.4 (3.2) % (4.2) % Europe 1,579.5 1,597.2 (1.1) % (2.1) % Asia 1,059.7 952.1 11.3 % 18.3 % Total Levi's Brands net revenues: 5,726.1 5,736.7 (0.2) % (0.1) % Other Brands 452.9 431.9 4.9 % 3.5 % Total net revenues $ 6,179.0 $ 6,168.6 0.2 % 0.2 % As compared to the same period in the prior year, currency translation did not have a significant impact on total net revenues. Americas . Net revenues in our Americas segment decreased on both reported and constant-currency bases, with currency affecting net revenues favorably by approximately $34 million. Constant-currency net revenues decreased as a result of lower revenue in our wholesale channel, partially offset by higher revenue in our DTC channels. Wholesale channel revenue decreased, primarily due to decreases in the United States driven by lower demand of our Levi's brand products due to a more cautious wholesale environment, leading to a decrease in units sold. The decrease in the United States was partially offset by increases in the international market. The increase in DTC channel revenue was driven by both strong performance within our company-operated stores as well as store expansion, leading to higher traffic in the current year and an increase in units sold. There were 31 more stores in operation as of November 26, 2023, as compared to November 27, 2022. E-commerce revenue increased primarily from higher average selling prices. Europe . Net revenues in Europe decreased on both a reported basis and on a constant-currency basis, with currency translation affecting net revenues favorably by approximately $16 million. Excluding the effects of currency, the Russia-Ukraine crisis adversely impacted net revenues by approximately $54 million or 3% for the fiscal year 2023. Constant-currency net revenues decreased in 2023 driven by lower wholesale revenue, which was primarily due to a decline in units sold as wholesale customers continued to rebalance inventory levels and experience softened consumer demand. The decrease in wholesale was partially offset by higher DTC channel revenue. The increase in DTC channel revenue was driven by strong performance in our company-operated stores. There were two more stores in operation as of November 26, 2023, as compared to November 27, 2022. E-commerce revenue increased primarily due to increased online traffic. Asia . Net revenues in Asia increased on both reported and constant-currency bases, with currency translation affecting net revenues unfavorably by approximately $56 million. Excluding the effects of currency, net revenues for 2023 grew across both our wholesale and DTC channels. The increase in wholesale channel revenue was primarily due to growth across most markets, particularly India, as a result of higher demand and order replenishments in the current year as compared to the prior year. The increase in DTC channel revenue was primarily due to strong performance in our company-operated stores, as higher traffic in the current year led to an increase in units sold, as compared to the prior year. Additionally, store expansion attributed to the revenue growth, as there were ten more stores in operation as of November 26, 2023, as compared to November 27, 2022. E-commerce revenue grew primarily due to increased online traffic as compared to the prior year. Other Brands. Net revenues in Other Brands increased on both reported and constant-currency bases, with currency translation affecting net revenues favorably by approximately $6 million. The increase in net revenues is driven by increases in revenue primarily from Beyond Yoga related to increase in e-commerce traffic and store expansion, with four more Beyond Yoga stores. There were 36 more Docker stores in operation as of November 26, 2023, as compared to November 27, 2022. 51 Table of Contents Gross profit The following table shows consolidated gross profit and gross margin for the periods indicated and the changes in these items from period to period: Year Ended November 26, 2023 November 27, 2022 % Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) Net revenues $ 6,179.0 $ 6,168.6 0.2 % Cost of goods sold 2,663.3 2,619.8 1.7 % Gross profit $ 3,515.7 $ 3,548.8 (0.9) % Gross margin 56.9 % 57.5 % As compared to the same period in the prior year, currency translation unfavorably impacted gross profit by approximately $6 million. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased product costs and lower full priced sales, partially offset by favorable channel mix. Additionally currency, including both transaction and translation impacts, favorably impacted gross margin by approximately 20 basis points. Selling, general and administrative expenses The following table shows SG&A expenses for the periods indicated, the changes in these items from period to period and these items expressed as a percentage of net revenues: Year Ended November 26, 2023 November 27, 2022 % Increase (Decrease) November 26, 2023 November 27, 2022 % of Net Revenues % of Net Revenues (Dollars in millions) Selling $ 1,370.4 $ 1,220.2 12.3 % 22.2 % 19.8 % Advertising and promotion 432.9 463.7 (6.6) % 7.0 % 7.5 % Administration 490.1 469.5 4.4 % 7.9 % 7.6 % Other 758.5 728.2 4.2 % 12.3 % 11.8 % Restructuring charges, net 20.3 9.1 123.1 % 0.3 % 0.1 % Total SG&A expenses $ 3,072.2 $ 2,890.7 6.3 % 49.7 % 46.9 % Currency translation affected SG&A expenses favorably by approximately $14 million as compared to the prior year. Selling . Currency translation impacted selling expenses favorably by approximately $6 million for the year ended November 26, 2023. The increase in selling expenses is primarily due to higher DTC sales volume in the current year as compared to the prior year as well as increased labor and store costs as a result of an increased number of stores and inflation. Advertising and promotion . Currency translation did not have a significant impact on advertising and promotion expense for the year ended November 26, 2023. The decrease in advertising and promotion expenses was primarily due to decreased media, digital investment and marketing spending. Administration . Administration expenses include functional administrative and organization costs. Currency translation impacted administration expenses favorably by approximately $10 million for the year ended November 26, 2023. The increase in administration costs was primarily due to $49.3 million in charges related to the impairment of capitalized internal-use software. This is in comparison to the year ended November 27, 2022 which included the recognition of $28.9 million in charges related to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, mostly impairment charges, including $33.3 million related to certain store right-of-use assets and $4.1 million related to other property, plant and equipment, net of a $15.8 million gain on the early termination of store leases. Additionally, the increase is attributed to higher compensation related to executives, partially offset by lower incentive accruals with $73.7 million charged to expense as compared to $104.2 million in the prior year. 52 Table of Contents Other . Other costs include distribution, information resources, and marketing organization costs. Currency translation did not have a significant impact on other SG&A expenses for fiscal year 2023. The increase in other costs was primarily due to higher distribution expenses attributable to increased freight costs and the impact of inflation, as well as higher spend on information technology expenses. Restructuring charges, net . During the year ended November 26, 2023, we recognized restructuring charges of $20.3 million as compared to $9.1 million in the prior year. The charges consist primarily of severance and other post-employment benefits related to a restructuring initiative that commenced in the prior year. Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges During the year ended November 26, 2023, we recognized impairment charges of $90.2 million related to the Beyond Yoga acquisition. The impairment charge is composed of a $75.4 million impairment of goodwill and a $14.8 million impairment of the trademark intangible asset. The impairment is due to incremental investments in the brand and team, and disciplined expansion in response to the current macroeconomic conditions as well as an increase in discount rates. During the year ended November 27, 2022, we recognized impairment charges of $11.6 million related to goodwill assigned to the Russia business. Operating income The following table shows operating income and corporate expenses for the periods indicated, the changes in these items from period to period and these items expressed as a percentage of corresponding segment net revenues or consolidated net revenues: Year Ended November 26, 2023 November 27, 2022 % Increase (Decrease) November 26, 2023 November 27, 2022 % of Net Revenues % of Net Revenues (Dollars in millions) Operating income: Levi's Brands: Americas $ 535.3 $ 654.4 (18.2) % 17.3 % 20.5 % Europe 305.0 349.9 (12.8) % 19.3 % 21.9 % Asia 147.2 111.2 32.4 % 13.9 % 11.7 % Total Levi's Brands operating income 987.5 1,115.5 (11.5) % 17.2 % 19.4 % Other Brands (0.1) 17.1 (100.6) % % 4.0 % Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges (90.2) (11.6) * (1.5) % v (0.2) % v Corporate expenses (543.9) (474.5) (14.6) % (8.8) % v (7.7) % v Total operating income $ 353.3 $ 646.5 (45.4) % 5.7 % v 10.5 % v Operating margin 5.7 % 10.5 % ______________ v Percentage of consolidated net revenues * Not meaningful Currency translation affected total operating income in fiscal year 2023 favorably by approximately $8 million as compared to the prior year. Levi's Brands operating income . Americas. Currency translation favorably affected operating income in the segment by approximately $10 million as compared to the prior year. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower net revenues and a lower gross margin, as compared to the prior year, as well as higher SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue. 53 Table of Contents Europe. Currency translation did not have a significant impact on operating income in the segment for fiscal year 2023. Excluding the effects of currency, the decrease in operating income was primarily due to a lower gross margin and higher SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue as compared to the prior year. Asia. Currency translation unfavorably affected operating income in the segment by approximately $10 million as compared to the prior year. Excluding the effects of currency, the increase in operating income was primarily due to higher net revenues in the current year as compared to the prior year as well as lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue. Other Brands. Currency translation did not have a significant impact on operating income for fiscal year 2023. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a lower gross margin and higher SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue as compared to the prior year, partially offset by higher net revenues. Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges. Currency translation did not have a significant impact on operating income for fiscal year 2023. During the year ended November 26, 2023, we recognized impairment charges of $90.2 million related to the Beyond Yoga acquisition. The impairment charge is composed of a $75.4 million impairment in goodwill and a $14.8 million impairment in the trademark intangible asset. The impairment is due to incremental investments in the brand and team, and disciplined expansion in response to the current macroeconomic conditions as well as an increase in discount rates. Corporate expenses . Currency translation favorably affected corporate expenses by approximately $9 million as compared to the prior year. Corporate expenses represent costs that management does not attribute to any of our operating segments. Included in corporate expenses are certain impairment charges, acquisition related charges and other corporate staff costs. Corporate expenses also include costs associated with our global inventory sourcing organization which are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin. The increase in corporate expenses for the year ended November 26, 2023 primarily includes $49.3 million in charges related to the impairment of capitalized internal-use software, net of a $3.9 million gain on the early termination of store leases related to the Russia-Ukraine crisis as compared to $28.9 million in charges related to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, primarily related to impairment and other related charges, net of a $15.8 million gain on the early termination of certain store leases. Operating margin . Currency translation favorably affected total operating margin by approximately 10 basis points as compared to the prior year. Compared to fiscal year 2022, consolidated operating income decreased 45.4% to $353.3 million from $646.5 million due to lower revenue, gross margin and higher SG&A expenses in the current year. Interest expense Interest expense was $45.9 million for the year ended November 26, 2023, as compared to $25.7 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to the revolver borrowings during fiscal year 2023, resulting in additional $5.0 million in interest expense. In addition, the increase is related to the inclusion of $14.1 million of gains related to the change in the value of the deferred compensation plan in the prior year. Effective as of the beginning of the current fiscal year, the impact of changes in the value of the deferred compensation plans have been classified as Other (expense) income, net. Our weighted-average interest rate on average borrowings outstanding for fiscal year 2023 was 4.20%, as compared to 3.96% for fiscal year 2022. Other (expense) income, net Other (expense) income, net, primarily consists of foreign exchange management activities and transactions. For the years ended November 26, 2023 and November 27, 2022, we recorded net other expenses of $42.2 million and net other income of $28.8 million, respectively. The net expense recognized in fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to the recognition of $19.0 million pension settlement loss, as well as $47.8 million of foreign currency transaction losses, partially offset by the $24.7 million gains on forward foreign exchange contracts. The prior year included the recognition of a $12.5 million COVID-19 related subsidy gain received from the German government as reimbursement for COVID-19 losses. Income tax expense Income tax expense was $15.6 million for the year ended November 26, 2023, compared to $80.5 million for the prior year. Our effective income tax rate was 5.9% for the year ended November 26, 2023, compared to 12.4% for the prior year. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily driven by higher benefit from the foreign derived intangible income deduction on advance royalty and prepaid service income, and no intellectual property transactions in fiscal year 2023. 54 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity outlook We believe we will have adequate liquidity over the next 12 months and in the longer term to operate our business and to meet our cash requirements. Over the long term, we plan to deploy capital across all four of our capital allocation priorities: (1) to reinvest 3.5-4% of our revenue in capital, including high growth investment opportunities and initiatives, to grow our business organically, (2) to return capital to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends, with a dividend payout ratio target of 25-35% of net income; (3) to pursue high return on investment acquisitions, both organic and inorganic, that support our current strategies; and (4) to repurchase shares with the goal of offsetting dilution or opportunistic buybacks or both, while maintaining an adequate public float of our shares. Our aim is to return 55-65% of our Adjusted free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We continue to concentrate our capital investments in new stores, distribution capacity and technology to accelerate the profitable growth of our business. For more information on our calculation of Adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measures, see - Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Future determinations regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our results of operations, payout ratio, capital requirements, financial condition, prospects, contractual arrangements, any limitations on payment of dividends present in our current and future debt agreements and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Cash sources We have historically relied primarily on cash flows from operations, borrowings under credit facilities, issuances of notes and other forms of debt financing. We regularly explore financing and debt reduction alternatives, including new credit agreements, unsecured and secured note issuances, equity financing, equipment and real estate financing, securitizations and asset sales. Our Credit Agreement provides for an asset-based, senior secured revolving credit facility ( Credit Facility ), in which the borrowing availability is primarily based on the value of our U.S. Levi trademarks and the levels of accounts receivable and inventory in the United States and Canada. The maximum availability under the facility is $1.0 billion, of which $950.0 million is available to us for revolving loans in U.S. Dollars and $50.0 million is available to us for revolving loans either in U.S. Dollars or Canadian Dollars. As of November 26, 2023, we did not have any borrowings under the Credit Facility. Unused availability under the facility was $942.8 million, and our total availability of $960.4 million (based on collateral levels as defined by the agreement less outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility) was reduced by $17.6 million from other credit-related instruments. We also had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $398.8 million resulting in a total liquidity position (unused availability and cash and cash equivalents) of approximately $1.3 billion. Of our $398.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $260.1 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. Cash uses Our principal cash requirements include working capital, capital expenditures, payments of principal and interest on our debt, payments of taxes, contributions to our pension plans and payments for postretirement health benefit plans, payment of taxes resulting from net settlement of shares issued under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended to date ("2016 Plan"), and our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan as amended to date ( 2019 Plan ), and, if market conditions warrant, occasional investments in, or acquisitions of, business ventures in our line of business. In addition, we regularly evaluate our ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock, all consistent with the terms of our debt agreements. On May 31, 2022, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $750 million of our Class A common stock. The previously approved $200 million share repurchase program was completed as of the end of the second quarter of 2022. During fiscal 2023, 0.5 million shares were repurchased for $8.1 million, plus broker's commissions, in the open market. During fiscal 2022, 8.7 million shares were repurchased for $172.9 million, plus broker's commissions, in the open market. In January 2024, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.12 per share to holders of record of its Class A and Class B common stock at the close of business on February 7, 2024, for a total quarterly dividend of approximately $48 million. In the absence of a dividend policy, we will continue to declare dividends on a quarterly basis and the expectation is that they will grow in line with net income. At this time, we expect dividends to be at $0.12 per share. Cash requirements for fiscal 2024 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in new stores, distribution capacity and technology. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 are expected to be approximately $290 million. 55 Table of Contents The following table summarizes current and long-term material cash requirements as of November 26, 2023: Material Cash Requirements Total 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter (Dollars in millions) Short-term and long-term debt obligations $ 1,030 $ 12 $ $ $ 518 $ $ 500 Interest (1) 197 47 37 35 22 18 38 Future minimum payments (2) 1,344 279 228 186 148 114 389 Inventory purchase commitments (3) 720 714 6 Purchase obligations (4) 415 116 75 67 40 28 89 Postretirement obligations (5) 42 6 6 5 5 4 16 Pension obligations (6) 133 17 13 13 13 13 64 Long-term employee related benefits (7) 117 14 6 5 4 4 84 Total $ 3,998 $ 1,205 $ 371 $ 311 $ 750 $ 181 $ 1,180 ______________ (1) Interest obligations are computed using constant interest rates until maturity. (2) Amounts reflect contractual obligations relating to our existing leased facilities as of November 26, 2023, and therefore do not reflect our planned future openings of company-operated retail stores. For more information, see Item 2 Properties. (3) Inventory purchase commitments represent agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of goods, including fabric commitments, at determinable prices. (4) Amounts reflect estimated commitments of $131 million for sponsorship, naming rights and related benefits with respect to the Levi's Stadium, and $269 million for human resources, advertising, information technology and other professional services. In January 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to extend the sponsorship deal for Levi's Stadium for an additional 10 years. This extension will add estimated commitments of $175 million after 2028 to the amounts presented in the table above. (5) The amounts presented in the table represent an estimate for the next ten years of our projected payments, based on information provided by our plans' actuaries, and have not been reduced by estimated Medicare subsidy receipts, the amounts of which are not material. Our policy is to fund postretirement benefits as claims and premiums are paid. For more information, see Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report. (6) The amounts presented in the table represent an estimate of our projected contributions to the plans for the next ten years based on information provided by our plans' actuaries. For U.S. qualified plans, these estimates can exceed the projected annual minimum required contributions in an effort to level out potential future funding requirements and provide annual funding flexibility. The 2024 contribution amounts will be recalculated at the end of the plans' fiscal years, which for our U.S. pension plan is at the beginning of our third fiscal quarter. Accordingly, actual contributions may differ materially from those presented here, based on factors such as changes in discount rates and the valuation of pension assets. For more information, see Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report. (7) Long-term employee-related benefits primarily relate to the current and non-current portion of deferred compensation arrangements and workers' compensation. We estimated these payments based on prior experience and forecasted activity for these items. For more information, see Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report. The above table does not include amounts related to our uncertain tax positions of $42.3 million. We do not anticipate a material effect on our liquidity as a result of payments in future periods of liabilities for uncertain tax positions. Based on the fair value of our capital stock and the number of shares outstanding as of November 26, 2023, future payments related to shares surrendered for employee tax withholding on the exercise or vesting of outstanding equity awards could range up to approximately $30 million, which could become payable in 2024. Information in the above table reflects our estimates of future cash payments. These estimates and projections are based upon assumptions that are inherently subject to significant economic, competitive, legislative and other uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, our actual expenditures and liabilities may be materially higher or lower than the estimates and projections reflected in the above table. The inclusion of these projections and estimates should not be regarded as a representation by us that the estimates will prove to be correct. 56 Table of Contents Cash flows The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our consolidated statements of cash flows: Year Ended November 26, 2023 November 27, 2022 (Dollars in millions) Cash provided by operating activities $ 435.5 $ 228.1 Cash used for investing activities (240.7) (235.7) Cash used for financing activities (214.1) (365.4) Cash and cash equivalents as of fiscal year end 398.8 429.6 Cash flows from operating activities Cash provided by operating activities was $435.5 million for fiscal year 2023, as compared to $228.1 million for fiscal year 2022. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2023 is primarily driven by lower spending on inventory and employee incentives, partially offset by higher spending on SG&A expenses, and lower collections on trade receivables. Cash flows from investing activities Cash used for investing activities was $240.7 million for fiscal year 2023, as compared to $235.7 million for fiscal year 2022. The increase in cash used for investing activities is due to higher payments incurred for capital expenditures during fiscal year 2023, partially offset by higher proceeds from short-term investments. Cash flows from financing activities Cash used for financing activities was $214.1 million for fiscal year 2023, as compared to $365.4 million for fiscal year 2022. Cash used in 2023 primarily reflects dividend payments of $190.5 million. Cash used in fiscal year 2022 primarily reflects dividend payments of $174.3 million and common stock repurchases of $175.7 million. Indebtedness The borrower of substantially all of our debt is Levi Strauss & Co., the parent and U.S. operating company. Of our total debt of $1.0 billion as of November 26, 2023, 100% was fixed-rate debt, net of capitalized debt issuance costs. As of November 26, 2023, our required aggregate debt principal payments of $1.0 billion begin in 2027. Short-term borrowings of $12.5 million at various foreign subsidiaries were expected to be either paid over the next 12 months or refinanced at the end of their applicable terms. Our long-term debt agreements contain customary covenants restricting our activities as well as those of our subsidiaries. We were in compliance with all of these covenants as of November 26, 2023. 57 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A Margin, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Margin, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share We define the following non-GAAP measures as follows: Most comparable GAAP measure Non-GAAP measure Non-GAAP measure definition Gross profit Adjusted gross profit Gross profit excluding COVID-19 and acquisition related inventory costs Gross margin Adjusted gross margin Adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net revenues Selling, general and administration ( SG&A ) expenses Adjusted SG&A SG&A expenses excluding changes in fair value on COVID-19 related charges, acquisition and integration related charges, impairment charges and early termination gains, net and restructuring related charges, severance and other, net.

Net income Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBIT excluding depreciation and amortization expense Net income margin Adjusted net income margin Adjusted net income as a percentage of net revenues Diluted earnings per share Adjusted diluted earnings per share Adjusted net income per weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding We believe Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted net income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income margin and Adjusted diluted earnings per share are useful to investors because they help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by certain expenses that we include in calculating net income but that can vary from company to company depending on its financing, capital structure and the method by which its assets were acquired, and can also vary significantly from period to period. Our management also uses Adjusted EBIT in conjunction with other GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including as a measure of our core operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted net income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income margin and Adjusted diluted earnings per share have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include: Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect income tax payments that reduce cash available to us; 58 Table of Contents Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness, which reduces cash available to us; Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin and Adjusted EBITDA exclude other income, which includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on our forward foreign exchange contracts and transaction gains and losses on our foreign exchange balances, although these items affect the amount and timing of cash available to us when these gains and losses are realized; Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income margin and Adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude COVID-19 government subsidy gains, unrealized gains on marketable securities originating in prior years, and loss on early extinguishment of debt; all of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude acquisition and integration charges, and restructuring and restructuring related charges, severance and other, net which can affect our current and future cash requirements; all of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain other SG&A expense items, which include severance, transaction and deal related costs, including acquisition and integration costs which can affect our current and future cash requirements; all of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain other SG&A expense items, which include non-cash property and equipment and right-of-use asset impairment charges. The store-related assets being impaired may still be in use, resulting in lower recurring expenses of depreciation of property and equipment and right-of-use asset amortization. Although property and equipment impairment charges are non-cash expenses, the assets being impaired may need to be replaced in the future which can affect our current and future cash requirements; the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculations of all of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from all of these non-GAAP financial measures or similarly titled measures; Adjusted EBITDA excludes the recurring, non-cash expenses of depreciation of property and equipment and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated may need to be replaced in the future; and Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income margin and Adjusted diluted earnings per share do not include all of the effects of income taxes and changes in income taxes reflected in net income. Because of these limitations, all of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with net income and other operating and financial performance measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. 59 Table of Contents Adjusted Gross Profit: The following table presents a reconciliation of gross profit, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted gross profit for each of the periods presented.

We define leverage ratio, as the ratio of total debt to the last 12 months Adjusted EBITDA. Our management believes that net debt and leverage ratio are important measures to monitor our financial flexibility and evaluate the strength of our balance sheet. Net debt and leverage ratio have limitations as analytical tools and may vary from similarly titled measures used by other companies. Net debt and leverage ratio should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of total debt, excluding capital leases, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to net debt for each of the periods presented. November 26, 2023 November 27, 2022 (Dollars in millions) Most comparable GAAP measure: Total debt, excluding finance leases $ 1,021.9 $ 996.2 Non-GAAP measure: Total debt, excluding finance leases $ 1,021.9 $ 996.2 Cash and cash equivalents (398.8) (429.6) Short-term investments in marketable securities (70.6) Net debt $ 623.1 $ 496.0 The following table presents a reconciliation of total debt, excluding capital leases, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to leverage ratio for each of the periods presented.

Previously, we defined Adjusted free cash flow as net cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, plus proceeds on settlement of forward foreign exchange contracts not designated for hedge accounting, less payment of debt extinguishment costs, less repurchases of common stock, tax withholdings on equity award exercises, and cash dividends to stockholders. We believe this revised definition is a more representative measure of our free cash flow, assists in the comparability of results, and is consistent with how management reviews performance. The table below includes the recast of prior period results. Additionally, we will provide updated non-GAAP reconciliations under this revised definition in future reports for the relevant prior year periods. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available after capital expenditures for operational expenses and investment in our business. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest in future growth and return capital to stockholders. Our use of Adjusted free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results under GAAP. First, Adjusted free cash flow is not a substitute for net cash flow from operating activities. Second, other companies may calculate Adjusted free cash flow or similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of Adjusted free cash flow as a tool for comparison. Additionally, the utility of Adjusted free cash flow is further limited as it does not reflect our future contractual commitments and does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. Because of these and other limitations, Adjusted free cash flow should be considered along with net cash flow from operating activities and other comparable financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted free cash flow for each of the periods presented. Year Ended November 26, 2023 November 27, 2022 (Dollars in millions) Most comparable GAAP measure: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 435.5 $ 228.1 Net cash used for investing activities (240.7) (235.7) Net cash used for financing activities (214.1) (365.4) Non-GAAP measure: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 435.5 $ 228.1 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (315.5) (268.3) Adjusted free cash flow $ 120.0 $ (40.2) Constant-Currency: We report our operating results in accordance with GAAP, as well as on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. The term foreign currency exchange rates refers to the exchange rates we use to translate our operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars. Because we are a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on our reported results. In general, our reported financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business. References to our operating results on a constant-currency basis mean our operating results without the impact of foreign currency translation fluctuations. We believe disclosure of constant-currency results is helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our results by increasing the transparency of our underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. However, constant-currency results are non-GAAP financial measures and are not meant to be 66 Table of Contents considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Constant-currency results have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Constant-currency results have limitations in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. We calculate constant-currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign exchange rates for the current period. Our constant-currency results do not eliminate the transaction currency impact, which primarily include the realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized from the measurement and remeasurement of purchases and sales of products in a currency other than the functional currency and of forward foreign exchange contracts. Additionally, gross margin and Adjusted gross margin are impacted by gains and losses related to the procurement of inventory, primarily products sourced in EUR and USD, by our global sourcing organization on behalf of our foreign subsidiaries.

Critical accounting estimates refers to those assumptions and approximations that may have a material impact on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes due to the level of subjectivity involved in developing the estimate. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting estimates, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in such estimates, based on newly available information, or different assumptions or conditions, may affect amounts reported in future periods. We summarize our critical accounting estimates and assumptions below. Sales returns and allowances . Revenue is recorded net of an allowance for estimated returns, discounts and retailer promotions and other similar incentives. We recognize allowances for estimated returns in the period in which the related sale is recorded. These estimates are calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information regarding retailer inventory levels. In addition, allowances for estimated returns may be established for significant future known or anticipated events. The types of known or anticipated events that are considered, and will continue to be considered, include the financial condition of our customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products. We recognize allowances for estimated discounts, retailer promotions and other similar incentives at the later of the period in which the related sale is recorded or the period in which the sales incentive is offered to the customer. These estimates are calculated using the most likely amount method. Under this method, certain forms of variable consideration are based on expected sell-through results, which requires subjective estimates. These estimates are supported by historical results as well as specific customer and product-specific facts and circumstances related to the current period. The determination of sales allowances is considered a critical accounting estimate because significant judgement is required to estimate sales volume and demand. Actual allowances may differ from estimates due to changes in sales volume based on wholesale customer or consumer demand and changes in customer and product-specific circumstances. Inventory valuation. We value inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. In determining inventory net realizable value, substantial consideration is given to the expected product selling price. We estimate expected selling prices based on our historical recovery rates for sale of slow-moving and obsolete inventory and other factors, such as market conditions, expected channel of disposition, and current consumer preferences. We record an adjustment to inventory when future estimated selling price is less than cost. The determination of inventory net realizable value is considered a critical accounting estimate because significant judgment is required to evaluate whether there will be future demand for inventories held as well as the prices at which our wholesale customers and retail consumers are willing to pay for these inventories. Estimates may differ from actual results due to changes in resale or market value, avenues of disposition, consumer and retailer preferences and economic conditions. Impairment . Upon acquisition, we estimate and record the fair value of purchased intangible assets, which primarily consist of trademarks and customer relationships. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, including trademark intangible assets, are not amortized, but are assessed for impairment at least annually. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable. We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Annual testing is performed in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for all indefinite-lived assets and reporting units except for the Beyond Yoga indefinite-lived assets and reporting unit, which is performed in the third quarter. When testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit or the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. For goodwill, if necessary, we perform a single step quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, if necessary, we perform a quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the asset with the asset's carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. For fiscal 2023, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for the goodwill in certain of our reporting units and 69 Table of Contents certain indefinite-lived intangible assets. This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors, as of the test date, to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value. For our other reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including Beyond Yoga , a quantitative assessment was performed. Determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset is based on management assessment, using industry accepted valuation models. Third-party valuation specialists are engaged when necessary. This determination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which may include revenue growth rates, profit margins, operating expenses, capital expenditures, terminal value, a royalty rate and a discount rate. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the amount of any such charge. Furthermore, estimating the fair value requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding not only our future plans, but industry and other market conditions outside of our control. Given the uncertainty of global economic conditions, those estimates could be significantly different than future performance. The Beyond Yoga reporting unit assets and liabilities, including the intangible assets, were established in the fourth quarter of 2021 at the fair value on the acquisition date. Based on the annual assessment in 2023, the carrying values of the reporting unit and the trademark intangible asset exceeded its estimated fair value, resulting in impairment charges being taken for the carrying values of the reporting unit and trademark intangible asset to approximate their respective approximate fair values. As our long-term strategies change, planned business performance expectations are not met over time, or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of the reporting unit, the intangible assets, or both might continue to decline and lead to additional impairment charges in the future. Several factors could impact the Beyond Yoga brand's ability to achieve expected future cash flows, including the success of retail store and international expansion, store and e-commerce productivity, the impact of promotional activity, continued economic volatility and potential operational challenges related to the macroeconomic factors and other strategic initiatives to drive increased profitability. Given that carrying value approximates fair value, if profitability trends decline over time from those that are expected, it is possible that an interim test, or our annual impairment test, could result in additional impairment of the related assets. Our other reporting units and intangible assets, primarily related to the 1985 acquisition of the Company by Levi Strauss Associates Inc., had substantial fair value in excess of carrying value. For further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for goodwill and intangible assets, see Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies - Goodwill and Intangible Assets. For further discussion of the impairment charges taken in 2023, see Note 5: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Income tax. Significant judgment is required in determining our global income tax provision, therefore, the determination of our income tax provision is considered a critical accounting estimate. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise from examinations in various jurisdictions and assumptions and estimates used in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Significant judgments are required in order to determine the realizability of deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the existence of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Changes in the expectations regarding the realization of deferred tax assets could materially impact income tax expense in future periods. We continuously review issues raised in connection with all ongoing examinations and open tax years to evaluate the adequacy of our tax liabilities. We evaluate uncertain tax positions under a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the uncertain tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on its technical merits. The second step is, for those positions that meet the recognition criteria, to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than fifty percent likely of being realized. We believe our recorded tax liabilities are adequate to cover all open tax years based on our assessment. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and involves significant judgments about future events. To the extent that our view as to the outcome of these matters changes, we will adjust income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. We classify interest and penalties related to income taxes as income tax expense. 70 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report for recently issued accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and expected impact to our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 71 Table of Contents
