ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS . Executive Overview The U.S. and global economies slowly strengthened during 2011. For the year, more than 1.8 million jobs were created in the U.S., the best performance in five years. Moreover, positive trends within the U.S. labor market continue to favor the staffing industry. Within the U.S. staffing industry, more than 650,000 jobs have been added since the recovery began in September 2009, and the temporary help penetration rate (the percentage of staffing jobs to total nonfarm jobs in the U.S.) has grown steadily for the past six months, concluding the year at 1.81%. We are encouraged by the positive economic and industry trends, which should lead to greater demand for our services. For Kelly, the strengthening trends are reflected in our 2011 fiscal year results: We achieved year-over-year revenue growth in all business segments. Operating earnings increased by over 50%, due to improved operational leverage. Year over year, OCG revenue increased 25% and results from operations improved by $15 million. Diluted earnings per share totaled $1.69 compared to $0.71 last year. We reinstated the Company dividend to stockholders during the third quarter. Our financial results were also enhanced by a very favorable tax rate. Work opportunity and HIRE Act tax credits provided over $28 million of combined benefit in 2011. Because both of these tax credit programs have expired, and it is uncertain if or when the work opportunity credit program will be reinstated, we expect our tax rate to be much higher in 2012. Kelly operates in a highly cyclical industry, which is very dependent on the global economy. Despite economic, geopolitical and other challenges we faced during the year, Kelly demonstrated its resolve to improve its financial performance and strategic position in the marketplace. We are encouraged by the trends this year, but current economic conditions across Europe are a concern. Looking forward, we remain committed to executing a business strategy that is aligned with the evolving workforce one that is focused on growing higher-margin PT staffing, expanding fee-based business and delivering customer-focused workforce solutions. Results of Operations 2011 versus 2010 Total Company Constant Currency 2011 2010 Change Change (In millions of dollars) Revenue from services $ 5,551.0 $ 4,950.3 12.1 % 9.6 % Fee-based income (included in revenue) 138.0 99.0 39.4 33.4 Gross profit 894.1 794.5 12.5 9.6 SG&A expenses excluding restructuring charges 833.6 747.2 11.6 Restructuring charges 2.8 7.2 (61.7 ) Total SG&A expenses 836.4 754.4 10.9 7.9 Asset impairments 2.0 (100.0 ) Earnings from operations 57.7 38.1 51.4 Gross profit rate 16.1 % 16.0 % 0.1 pts. Expense rates (excluding restructuring charges): % of revenue 15.0 15.1 (0.1 ) % of gross profit 93.2 94.0 (0.8 ) Operating margin 1.0 0.8 0.2 17 Table of Contents The year-over-year change in revenue resulted primarily from a 7% increase in hours worked, combined with a 2% increase in average bill rates on a constant currency basis. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased in all business segments. Compared to 2010, the 2011 gross profit rate improved slightly. The growth in fee-based income offset a decline in the temporary staffing gross profit rate due to the unfavorable impact related to the expiration of the HIRE Act payroll tax benefit in the U.S. The Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment ( HIRE ) Act, which allowed employers to receive tax incentives for hiring and retaining previously unemployed individuals, resulted in a benefit to our gross profit of $21 million in 2010. HIRE Act benefits were also available in 2011, but as an income tax credit, rather than a benefit to the Company gross profit. Fee-based income has a significant impact on gross profit rates. There are very low direct costs of services associated with fee-based income. Therefore, increases or decreases in fee-based income can have a disproportionate impact on gross profit rates. Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses increased year over year due primarily to higher compensation costs. During the year we have hired full-time employees, primarily in our PT and OCG businesses, reinstated certain retirement benefits and merit increase programs and increased incentive-based compensation. Restructuring costs incurred in 2011 primarily relate to revisions of the estimated lease termination costs for EMEA Commercial branches that closed in prior years. Restructuring costs incurred in 2010 primarily related to severance and lease termination costs for branches in the EMEA Commercial and APAC Commercial segments that were in the process of closure at the end of 2009, and severance costs related to the corporate headquarters. Income tax benefit for 2011 was $7.3 million (-12.6%), compared to income tax expense of $6.6 million (20.2%) for 2010. The income tax benefit in 2011 was largely impacted by significant employment-related income tax credits, including the favorable impact of the HIRE Act retention credit ($11 million) and continued strong work opportunity credits ($17 million). Together, these income tax credits totaled $28.5 million in 2011, compared to $11.7 million in 2010. The Company also determined that for tax reporting purposes it was eligible for worthless stock deductions related to foreign subsidiaries, which provided U.S. federal and state benefits of $8.4 million in 2011, compared to $1.0 million in 2010. The HIRE Act retention credit is available only in 2011, and is in addition to the HIRE Act payroll tax benefits recognized in cost of services in 2010. The work opportunity credit program expired at the end of 2011, and it is uncertain if or when it will be reinstated. Included in earnings from continuing operations were restructuring charges of $2.8 million, net of tax, for 2011 and $5.4 million, net of tax, for 2010. Diluted earnings from continuing operations per share for 2011 were $1.72, as compared to $0.71 for 2010. Discontinued operations in 2011 represents costs of litigation, net of tax, retained from the 2007 sale of the Kelly Home Care business unit. 18 Table of Contents Americas Commercial Constant Currency 2011 2010 Change Change (In millions of dollars) Revenue from services $ 2,660.9 $ 2,428.2 9.6 % 9.2 % Fee-based income (included in revenue) 12.0 8.8 38.1 37.0 Gross profit 377.0 354.9 6.2 5.8 SG&A expenses excluding restructuring charges 293.1 275.3 6.5 Restructuring charges 0.3 (100.0 ) Total SG&A expenses 293.1 275.6 6.3 6.0 Earnings from operations 83.9 79.3 5.9 Gross profit rate 14.2 % 14.6 % (0.4 )pts.

Americas PT revenue represented 18% of total Company revenue in both 2011 and 2010. 19 Table of Contents The Americas PT gross profit rate decreased primarily due to the unfavorable impact related to the expiration of the HIRE Act payroll tax benefit, partially offset by the favorable impact of increased fee-based income. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to the reinstatement of merit increases and certain retirement benefits, additional staff and increased performance-based compensation.

EMEA Commercial revenue represented 18% of total Company revenue in both 2011 and 2010. The increase in SG&A expenses was due to increased hiring of full-time employees in specific countries with identified high-growth potential.

EMEA PT revenue represented 3% of total Company revenue in both 2011 and 2010. The change in the EMEA PT gross profit rate was primarily due to increases in fee-based income. SG&A expenses increased, due to hiring of full-time employees and investments in additional branches in Russia, Germany and the U.K. APAC Commercial Constant Currency 2011 2010 Change Change (In millions of dollars) Revenue from services $ 397.6 $ 355.3 11.9 % 4.1 % Fee-based income (included in revenue) 13.9 11.4 23.0 14.2 Gross profit 55.7 48.4 15.3 6.6 SG&A expenses excluding restructuring charges 53.8 45.1 19.3 Restructuring charges 0.5 (100.0 ) Total SG&A expenses 53.8 45.6 17.9 8.8 Earnings from operations 1.9 2.8 (29.1 ) Gross profit rate 14.0 % 13.6 % 0.4 pts.

APAC Commercial revenue represented 7% of total Company revenue in both 2011 and 2010. The change in the APAC Commercial gross profit rate was primarily due to higher growth in fee-based income. SG&A expenses increased, primarily due to higher salaries and related costs from the investment in additional full-time employees across the region. 21 Table of Contents APAC PT Constant Currency 2011 2010 Change Change (In millions of dollars) Revenue from services $ 51.4 $ 32.5 58.1 % 48.9 % Fee-based income (included in revenue) 15.3 10.5 47.7 37.9 Gross profit 20.6 13.9 48.4 38.4 SG&A expenses 23.2 17.0 37.0 27.7 Earnings from operations (2.6 ) (3.1 ) 14.1 Gross profit rate 40.1 % 42.7 % (2.6 )pts.

APAC PT revenue represented 1% of total Company revenue in both 2011 and 2010. The change in the APAC PT gross profit rate was due primarily to a decline in fee-based income as a percentage of total revenue from services, along with changes in temporary business mix with higher volume in the IT divisions. SG&A expenses increased, due to hiring of permanent placement recruiters and increases in incentive-based compensation. OCG Constant Currency 2011 2010 Change Change (In millions of dollars) Revenue from services $ 317.3 $ 254.8 24.5 % 23.6 % Fee-based income (included in revenue) 39.5 25.6 54.3 49.8 Gross profit 87.3 60.0 45.7 43.3 SG&A expenses excluding restructuring charges 89.9 77.5 16.0 Restructuring charges 0.1 (100.0 ) Total SG&A expenses 89.9 77.6 15.9 13.1 Earnings from operations (2.6 ) (17.6 ) 85.0 Gross profit rate 27.5 % 23.5 % 4.0 pts.

OCG revenue represented 6% of total Company revenue in 2011 and 5% in 2010. 22 Table of Contents The OCG gross profit rate increased primarily due to increased volume mix in the BPO, RPO and CWO practice areas, as well as increases in gross profit rates for both the BPO and RPO practice areas for the year. The increase in SG&A expenses is primarily the result of support costs associated with the expansion of customer programs, as well as higher volumes on existing programs, in our RPO and CWO practice areas. Results of Operations 2010 versus 2009 Total Company Constant 2010 2009 Currency (52 Weeks) (53 Weeks) Change Change (In millions of dollars) Revenue from services $ 4,950.3 $ 4,314.8 14.7 % 13.7 % Fee-based income (included in revenue) 99.0 86.1 15.0 12.6 Gross profit 794.5 701.7 13.2 12.3 SG&A expenses excluding restructuring charges 747.2 764.8 (2.3 ) Restructuring charges 7.2 29.9 (75.8 ) Total SG&A expenses 754.4 794.7 (5.1 ) (5.9 ) Asset impairments 2.0 53.1 (96.2 ) Earnings from operations 38.1 (146.1 ) NM Gross profit rate 16.0 % 16.3 % (0.3 )pts. Expense rates (excluding restructuring charges): % of revenue 15.1 17.7 (2.6 ) % of gross profit 94.0 109.0 (15.0 ) Operating margin 0.8 (3.4 ) 4.2 The year-over-year change in revenue was the result of an increase in hours worked of 17%, partially offset by a decrease in average hourly bill rates of 3% on a constant currency basis. On a constant currency basis, revenue for 2010 increased in all seven business segments, with the exception of EMEA Commercial. The 2009 fiscal year included a 53 rd week. This fiscal leap year occurs every five or six years and is necessary to align the fiscal and calendar periods. The 53 rd week added approximately 1% to 2009 revenue. Compared to 2009, the 2010 gross profit rate decreased or remained flat in all business segments, with the exception of EMEA Commercial and APAC PT. The decrease in the gross profit rate was caused by a reduction in our temporary margins, primarily within the Americas and OCG businesses. Our average temporary margin continued to be impacted by shifts to a higher proportion of light industrial business compared to clerical, to large corporate customers compared to retail and, within OCG, to a higher proportion of the lower-margin PPO business. In addition, our temporary margins were impacted by higher state unemployment taxes in the Americas to the extent not recovered through pricing. All of these items negatively impacting the gross profit rate were partially offset by the favorable impact from the HIRE Act payroll tax benefit. The HIRE Act resulted in a benefit of $21 million in 2010. The HIRE Act expired at the end of 2010. SG&A expenses decreased year over year due to the impact of expense reduction initiatives implemented in 2009 and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation. Restructuring costs in 2010 relate primarily to severance and lease termination costs for branches in the EMEA Commercial and APAC Commercial segments that were in the process of closure at the end of 2009, as well as severance costs related to the corporate headquarters. Restructuring costs in 2009 relate primarily to global severance, lease terminations, asset write-offs and other miscellaneous costs incurred in connection with the reduction in the number of permanent employees and the consolidation, sale or closure of branch locations. 23 Table of Contents Asset impairment charges in 2010 represent the write-off of incomplete software projects in Europe and the U.S. Asset impairment charges in 2009 represent goodwill impairment losses related to Americas Commercial, EMEA PT and APAC Commercial, and impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets in Japan and Europe. We recorded income tax expense for 2010 at an effective rate of 20.2%, compared to an income tax benefit at an effective rate of 29.1% in 2009. The 2010 rate was positively impacted by nontaxable income from the cash surrender value of life insurance policies used to fund the Company deferred compensation plan, and by work opportunity tax credits. The 2009 rate was positively impacted by these items, but was also negatively impacted by non-deductible asset impairment charges and valuation allowances on operating losses and restructuring charges in certain foreign countries. Earnings from continuing operations were $26.1 million in 2010, compared to a loss of $105.1 million in 2009. Included in earnings from continuing operations for 2010 was $5.4 million, net of tax, of restructuring charges and $1.5 million, net of tax, of asset impairment charges. Included in loss from continuing operations in 2009 were $24.0 million, net of tax, of restructuring charges and $50.0 million, net of tax, of asset impairment charges. Net earnings for 2010 totaled $26.1 million, compared to a loss of $104.5 million in 2009. Diluted earnings from continuing operations per share for 2010 was $0.71, as compared to diluted loss from continuing operations per share of $3.01 for 2009.

Expense rates (excluding restructuring charges): % of revenue 11.3 13.8 (2.5 ) % of gross profit 77.5 93.9 (16.4 ) Operating margin 3.3 0.5 2.8 The change in Americas Commercial revenue from services reflected an increase in hours worked of 22%. Americas Commercial represented 49% of total Company revenue for 2010 and 46% for 2009. The decrease in the gross profit rate was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of lower-margin light industrial business to higher-margin clerical business and higher state unemployment taxes to the extent not recovered through pricing, partially offset by the impact of HIRE Act payroll tax benefit. The HIRE Act benefit impacted the gross profit rate by 60 basis points. SG&A expenses excluding restructuring were essentially flat as lower facilities costs, depreciation and corporate allocation offset higher performance-based compensation. 24 Table of Contents Americas PT Constant 2010 2009 Currency (52 Weeks) (53 Weeks) Change Change (In millions of dollars) Revenue from services $ 889.0 $ 792.6 12.2 % 12.0 % Fee-based income (included in revenue) 9.0 9.4 (4.5 ) (4.9 ) Gross profit 140.0 125.1 12.0 11.8 SG&A expenses excluding restructuring charges 93.7 100.9 (7.0 ) Restructuring charges 1.0 (100.0 ) Total SG&A expenses 93.7 101.9 (8.0 ) (8.2 ) Earnings from operations 46.3 23.2 100.1 Gross profit rate 15.8 % 15.8 % pts.

Americas PT revenue represented 18% of total Company revenue in both 2010 and 2009. The Americas PT gross profit rate was unchanged, as higher state unemployment taxes to the extent not recovered through pricing were offset by the impact of HIRE Act payroll tax benefit. The HIRE Act benefit impacted the gross profit rate by 60 basis points. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to lower salary expense related to reductions in personnel. EMEA Commercial Constant 2010 2009 Currency (52 Weeks) (53 Weeks) Change Change (In millions of dollars) Revenue from services $ 872.0 $ 895.2 (2.6 )% (0.9 )% Fee-based income (included in revenue) 19.1 16.6 15.9 16.0 Gross profit 141.0 140.2 0.6 2.3 SG&A expenses excluding restructuring charges 130.5 150.3 (13.2 ) Restructuring charges 2.7 15.6 (82.8 ) Total SG&A expenses 133.2 165.9 (19.7 ) (18.9 ) Asset impairments 1.5 NM Earnings from operations 6.3 (25.7 ) NM Gross profit rate 16.2 % 15.7 % 0.5 pts.

The decrease in the constant currency average hourly bill rates for EMEA Commercial was due to a change in the mix from countries with higher average bill rates to those with lower average bill rates, such as Russia and Portugal. During 2009, EMEA Commercial completed a significant restructuring within the United Kingdom and exited the staffing business in Spain, Turkey, Ukraine and Finland, and in 2010 exited the staffing business in the Czech Republic. Exiting these locations accounted for approximately 4 percentage points of the 2010 constant currency decline. EMEA Commercial revenue represented 18% of total Company revenue in 2010 and 21% in 2009. The change in the gross profit rate is due to higher fee-based income, as well as higher temporary margins as a result of business and customer mix. The restructuring actions and other continuing cost-savings initiatives, partially offset by higher incentive-based compensation, resulted in the decrease in SG&A expenses.

EMEA PT revenue represented 3% of total Company revenue in both 2010 and 2009. The decrease in the EMEA PT gross profit rate was primarily due to decreases in fee-based income. SG&A expenses declined due to reductions in personnel. 26 Table of Contents APAC Commercial Constant 2010 2009 Currency (52 Weeks) (53 Weeks) Change Change (In millions of dollars) Revenue from services $ 355.3 $ 284.9 24.7 % 12.9 % Fee-based income (included in revenue) 11.4 9.7 16.6 5.6 Gross profit 48.4 41.6 16.2 4.6 SG&A expenses excluding restructuring charges 45.1 44.6 1.3 Restructuring charges 0.5 1.6 (66.5 ) Total SG&A expenses 45.6 46.2 (1.0 ) (10.7 ) Earnings from operations 2.8 (4.6 ) NM Gross profit rate 13.6 % 14.6 % (1.0 )pts.

The decrease in the constant currency average hourly bill rates for APAC Commercial was primarily due to the decision to exit the staffing market in Japan. Excluding Japan, the average bill rate increased by 1% on a constant currency basis. APAC Commercial revenue represented 7% of total Company revenue in both 2010 and 2009. The decrease in the APAC Commercial gross profit rate was due to a decrease in temporary gross profit rates due to growth in lower margin business, primarily in Australia and Malaysia, as well as our decision to exit the staffing business in Japan. The decision to exit the staffing business in Japan impacted constant currency revenue and SG&A expense comparisons by approximately 8 percentage points and 11 percentage points, respectively.

The decrease in the constant currency average hourly bill rates for APAC PT was due to a change in mix from countries with higher average bill rates to those with lower average bill rates, such as India, as well as the decision to exit the staffing market in Japan. APAC PT revenue represented 1% of total Company revenue in both 2010 and 2009. The change in the APAC PT gross profit rate was due primarily to increases in fee-based income. SG&A expenses increased, due primarily to hiring of permanent placement recruiters. OCG Constant 2010 2009 Currency (52 Weeks) (53 Weeks) Change Change (In millions of dollars) Revenue from services $ 254.8 $ 219.9 15.8 % 15.6 % Fee-based income (included in revenue) 25.6 24.4 4.9 3.9 Gross profit 60.0 59.7 0.2 (0.1 ) SG&A expenses excluding restructuring charges 77.5 69.6 11.3 Restructuring charges 0.1 1.9 (96.0 ) Total SG&A expenses 77.6 71.5 8.5 8.1 Earnings from operations (17.6 ) (11.8 ) (50.8 ) Gross profit rate 23.5 % 27.2 % (3.7 )pts. Expense rates (excluding restructuring charges): % of revenue 30.4 31.7 (1.3 ) % of gross profit 129.5 116.6 12.9 Operating margin (7.0 ) (5.3 ) (1.7 ) Revenue from services in the OCG segment for 2010 increased in the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions, due primarily to growth in our PPO and RPO practices. OCG revenue represented 5% of total Company revenue in both 2010 and 2009. The OCG gross profit rate decreased primarily due to the growth in our lower-margin PPO practice and training costs associated with our BPO unit. The decline was mitigated somewhat from increased revenues in our higher margin RPO, CWO and executive placement practice areas during 2010. SG&A expenses increased, due to increased investments in implementation and travel costs for new customer business, as well as higher technology costs in our CWO practice area. During 2010, OCG had positive growth in our PPO, RPO and CWO practice areas. However, earnings from operations were negatively impacted by decreased operating earnings in our outplacement business unit, as well as the aforementioned investments for new customer programs and the upfront BPO training costs, where the revenue stream tends to lag our investment. Results of Operations Financial Condition Historically, we have financed our operations through cash generated by operating activities and access to credit markets. Our working capital requirements are primarily generated from temporary employee payroll and customer accounts receivable. Since receipts from customers generally lag payroll to temporary employees, working capital requirements increase substantially in periods of growth. As highlighted in the consolidated statements of cash flows, our liquidity and available capital resources are impacted by four key components: cash and equivalents, operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. 28 Table of Contents Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents totaled $81 million at the end of 2011, compared to $80 million at year-end 2010. As further described below, during 2011, we generated $19 million of cash from operating activities, used $21 million of cash for investing activities and generated $6 million in cash from financing activities. Operating Activities In 2011, we generated $19 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to generating $42 million in 2010 and using $27 million in 2009. The decrease from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to growth in trade accounts receivable, partially offset by improved operating results. The increase from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to improved earnings in 2010. Trade accounts receivable totaled $945 million at the end of 2011. Global days sales outstanding ( DSO ) for the fourth quarter were 52 days for 2011, compared to 49 days for 2010. Our working capital position was $417 million at the end of 2011, an increase of $49 million from year-end 2010. The current ratio was 1.6 at both year-end 2011 and 2010. Investing Activities In 2011, we used $21 million of cash for investing activities, compared to $11 million in 2010 and $23 million in 2009. Capital expenditures, which totaled $15 million in 2011, $11 million in 2010 and $13 million in 2009, primarily related to the Company information technology programs. In 2011, capital expenditures included costs for the implementation of the PeopleSoft payroll, billing and accounts receivable project. The PeopleSoft payroll, billing and accounts receivable project, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2004, is intended to cover the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico, the U.K. and Ireland. Through 2011, the Company implemented modules associated with accounts receivable in all locations, payroll and billing in the U.K. and Ireland, payroll in Canada and general ledger and fixed assets in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada. We anticipate spending approximately $20 to $25 million to complete the PeopleSoft project by the end of 2015. Included in the consolidated balance sheet at year-end 2011 was $4.8 million of capitalized costs related to unimplemented PeopleSoft modules. To establish the Company presence in the Brazilian market, we acquired the stock of Tradi o Planejamento e Tecnologia de Servi os S.A. and Tradi o Tecnologia e Servi os Ltda. (collectively, Tradi o ), a national service provider in Brazil, in November, 2011 for $6.6 million in cash. In addition to the cash payment, the Company assumed debt of $8.8 million as part of this transaction. The operating results of Tradi o will be included as a business unit in the Americas Commercial operating segment. Tradi o will be accounted for on a one-month lag; accordingly, Kelly consolidated financial statements for 2011 do not include operating results for Tradi o. During 2009, we made the following payments related to acquisitions: $5.7 million earnout payment related to the 2007 acquisition of access AG, $1.0 million related to the 2007 acquisition of CGR/seven LLC, $0.6 million earnout payment related to the 2006 acquisition of The Ayers Group and $0.2 million earnout payment related to the 2008 acquisition of Toner Graham. During 2011, the Company remaining two Japanese yen-denominated forward foreign currency contracts matured. Also during 2011, a non-deliverable forward foreign currency exchange contract to hedge the anticipated acquisition of Tradi o by selling U.S. dollars and buying Brazilian real matured. The settlement of these contracts resulted in net proceeds of $1.1 million to the Company. As of January 1, 2012, the Company had no open forward foreign currency exchange contracts. 29 Table of Contents Financing Activities In 2011, we generated $6 million in cash from financing activities, as compared to using $35 million in 2010 and generating $20 million in 2009. Debt totaled $96 million at year-end 2011 compared to $79 million at year-end 2010. Debt-to-total capital is a common ratio to measure the relative capital structure and leverage of the Company. Our ratio of debt-to-total capital (total debt reported on the balance sheet divided by total debt plus stockholders equity) was 12.5% at the end of 2011 and 11.2% at the end of 2010. To take advantage of improved conditions in the credit markets and obtain more favorable pricing and flexible terms and conditions, effective March 31, 2011, we refinanced our secured revolving credit facility and securitization facility. Our new revolver has total capacity of $150 million and carries a term of five years, maturing March 31, 2016. The new securitization facility carries a three-year term and has a total capacity of $150 million. In 2011, the net change in short-term borrowings included $67 million related to borrowings on the securitization facility. Subsequent to the acquisition of Tradi o in November, 2011, we established an unsecured, uncommitted revolving line of credit for the Brazilian legal entities, which used the facility to pay off short-term debt. Accordingly, also included in the net change in short-term borrowings is $6 million related to borrowings under the revolving line of credit in Brazil. In 2010, the net change in short-term borrowings included $38 million related to payments on the securitization facility. In 2009, the net change in short-term borrowings included $55 million related to borrowings on the securitization facility. During 2011, we repaid term debt of $68 million. Included in this amount is $5 million of short-term debt which was paid off by our Brazilian legal entities subsequent to the acquisition of Tradi o. During 2010, we paid $15 million due on our yen-denominated credit facility. During 2009, we repaid short-term debt of $23 million, and $8 million due on our yen-denominated credit facility. Included in financing activities during 2010 was $24 million related to the sale of 1,576,169 shares of Kelly Class A common stock to Temp Holdings. The shares were sold in a private transaction at $15.42 per share, which was the average of the closing prices of the Class A common stock for the five days from May 3, 2010 through May 7, 2010, and represented 4.8 percent of the outstanding Class A shares after the completion of the sale. Dividends paid per common share were $0.10 in 2011. No dividends were paid in 2009 or 2010. Payments of dividends are restricted by the financial covenants contained in our debt facilities. Details of this restriction are contained in the Debt footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Summarized below are our obligations and commitments to make future payments as of year-end 2011: Payment due by period Less than More than Total 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 years (In millions of dollars) Operating leases $ 115.7 $ 45.6 $ 48.5 $ 16.2 $ 5.4 Short-term borrowings 96.3 96.3 Accrued insurance 85.0 31.5 22.9 10.2 20.4 Accrued retirement benefits 97.5 6.4 12.9 13.0 65.2 Other long-term liabilities 15.4 0.9 7.2 6.9 0.4 Uncertain income tax positions 8.3 0.6 5.0 0.9 1.8 Purchase obligations 18.3 12.8 5.5 Total $ 436.5 $ 194.1 $ 102.0 $ 47.2 $ 93.2 The table above excludes interest payments and, in certain cases, payment streams are estimated. Purchase obligations above represent unconditional commitments relating primarily to voice and data communications services which we expect to utilize generally within the next two fiscal years, in the ordinary course of business. We have no material, unrecorded commitments, losses, contingencies or guarantees associated with any related parties or unconsolidated entities. Liquidity We expect to meet our ongoing short- and long-term cash requirements principally through cash generated from operations, available cash and equivalents, securitization and committed unused credit facilities. Additional funding sources could include public or private bonds, asset-based lending, additional bank facilities, issuance of equity or other sources. We utilize intercompany loans, dividends, capital contributions and redemptions to effectively manage our cash on a global basis. At the present time, we do not have plans to repatriate the majority of our international excess cash balances. We expect this international cash will be needed to fund working capital growth in our local operations. The majority of our international cash was concentrated in a cash pooling arrangement (the Cash Pool ) and was available to fund general corporate needs internationally. The Cash Pool is a set of cash accounts maintained with a single bank that must, as a whole, maintain at least a zero balance; individual accounts may be positive or negative. This allows countries with excess cash to invest and countries with cash needs to utilize the excess cash. We manage our cash and debt very closely to optimize our capital structure. As our cash balances build, we tend to pay down debt as appropriate. Conversely, when working capital needs grow, we tend to use corporate cash and cash available in the Cash Pool first, and then access our borrowing facilities. At year-end 2011, we had $144 million of available capacity on our $150 million revolving credit facility and $16 million of available capacity on our $150 million securitization facility. The securitization facility carried $84 million of short-term borrowings and $50 million of standby letters of credit related to workers compensation. Together, the revolving credit and securitization facilities provide the Company with committed funding capacity that may be used for general corporate purposes. While we believe these facilities will cover our working capital needs over the short term, if economic conditions or operating results change significantly, we may need to seek additional sources of funds. At year-end 2011, we also had additional unsecured, uncommitted short-term credit facilities totaling $16 million, under which we had borrowed $6 million. Details of our debt facilities as of the 2011 year end are contained in the Debt footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 31 Table of Contents We monitor the credit ratings of our major banking partners on a regular basis. We also have regular discussions with them. Based on our reviews and communications, we believe the risk of one or more of our banks not being able to honor commitments is insignificant. We also review the ratings and holdings of our money market funds and other investment vehicles regularly to ensure high credit quality and access to our invested cash. As of the end of fiscal 2011, we had no holdings of sovereign debt in Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Spain or Greece. Our investment policy requires our international affiliates to contribute any excess cash balances to the Cash Pool. We then manage this as counterparty exposure and distribute the risk among our Cash Pool provider and other banks we may designate from time to time. At the end of fiscal 2011, our total exposure to European receivables from our customers was $272.3 million, which represents 29% of total trade accounts receivable, net. The percentage of trade accounts receivable over 90 days past due for Europe was consistent with our global experience. Net trade accounts receivable for Italy, Portugal and Ireland, specific countries currently experiencing economic volatility, totaled $39.6 million at the 2011 year end, and we have not experienced a significant deterioration in these amounts during the fourth quarter of 2011. During 2011, we have substantially ceased on-going operations in Spain. Critical Accounting Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In this process, it is necessary for us to make certain assumptions and related estimates affecting the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the attached notes. Actual results can differ from assumed and estimated amounts. Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We consider the following estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and apply percentages to certain aged receivable categories. We also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, and we monitor historical trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. Historically, losses from uncollectible accounts have not exceeded our allowance. Since we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance may be required. In the event we determined that a smaller or larger allowance was appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to SG&A expense in the period in which we made such a determination. In addition, we also include a provision for sales allowances, based on our historical experience, in our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable. If sales allowances vary from our historical experience, an adjustment to the allowance may be required. As of year-end 2011 and 2010, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $13 million and $12 million, respectively. 32 Table of Contents Workers Compensation We have a combination of insurance and self-insurance contracts under which we effectively bear the first $500,000 of risk per single accident, except in the state of California, where we bear the first $750,000 of risk per single accident. There is no aggregate limitation on our per-risk exposure under these insurance and self-insurance programs. We establish accruals for workers compensation utilizing actuarial methods to estimate the undiscounted future cash payments that will be made to satisfy the claims, including an allowance for incurred-but-not-reported claims. This process includes establishing loss development factors, based on our historical claims experience as well as industry experience, and applying those factors to current claims information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claims liability. In preparing the estimates, we also consider the nature, frequency and severity of the claims, reserving practices of our third party claims administrators, performance of our medical cost management programs, changes in our territory and business line mix and current legal, economic and regulatory factors such as industry estimates of medical cost trends. Where appropriate, multiple generally-accepted actuarial techniques are applied and tested in the course of preparing our estimates. We evaluate the accrual, and the underlying assumptions, regularly throughout the year and make adjustments as needed. The ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accrual. While we believe that the recorded amounts are reasonable, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger accrual is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to cost of services in the period in which we made such a determination. The accrual for workers compensation, net of related receivables which are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet, was $70 million and $71 million at year-end 2011 and 2010, respectively. Goodwill We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. Generally accepted accounting principles require that goodwill be tested for impairment at a reporting unit level. We have determined that our reporting units are the same as our operating and reportable segments. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step process. In the first step, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required. To derive the estimated fair value of reporting units, we primarily relied on an income approach. Under the income approach, estimated fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit being measured. Estimated future cash flows are based on our internal projection model. Assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, a second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of a reporting unit goodwill. Determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires valuation of a reporting unit tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination. If the carrying value of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, goodwill is deemed impaired and is written down to the extent of the difference. We completed our annual impairment test for all reporting units in the fourth quarter for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2012 and January 2, 2011 and determined that goodwill was not impaired. During the second quarter of 2010, continuing operating losses in the Company OCG reporting unit were deemed to be a triggering event for purposes of assessing goodwill for impairment. Accordingly, we tested goodwill related to OCG and determined that OCG goodwill was not impaired. Our analysis used significant assumptions by segment, including: expected future revenue and expense growth rates, profit margins, cost of capital, discount rate and forecasted capital expenditures. Our revenue projections assumed near-term growth consistent with current year results, followed by long-term modest growth. 33 Table of Contents Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. Different assumptions of the anticipated future results and growth from these businesses could result in an impairment charge, which would decrease operating income and result in lower asset values on our consolidated balance sheet. For example, a 10% reduction in our growth rate assumptions would not result in the estimated fair value falling below book value for any of our segments. At year-end 2011 and 2010, total goodwill amounted to $90 and $67 million, respectively. (See the Goodwill footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements). Income Taxes Income tax expense is based on expected income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Judgment is required in determining our income tax expense. We establish accruals for uncertain tax positions under generally accepted accounting principles, which require that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities that have full knowledge of all relevant information. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of accrual provisions and changes to accruals that we consider appropriate, as well as related interest and penalties. A number of years may lapse before a particular matter, for which we have or have not established an accrual, is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that our accruals are appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles. Favorable or unfavorable adjustment of the accrual for any particular issue would be recognized as an increase or decrease to our income tax expense in the period of a change in facts and circumstances. Our current tax accruals are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within income and other taxes and long-term tax accruals are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within other long-term liabilities. Tax laws require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the income tax expense reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than the liability reported in our tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, which are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, which give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our consolidated income statement. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction on our tax return, but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements. Our net deferred tax asset is recorded using currently enacted tax rates, and may need to be adjusted in the event tax rates change. The U.S. work opportunity credit is allowed for wages earned in a fiscal period by employees in certain targeted groups. The actual amount of creditable wages in a particular period is estimated, since the credit is only available once an employee reaches a minimum employment period and the employee inclusion in a targeted group is certified by the applicable state. As these events often occur after the period the wages are earned, judgment is required in determining the amount of work opportunity credits accrued for in each period. We evaluate the accrual regularly throughout the year and make adjustments as needed. Litigation Kelly is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. Kelly routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the accruals required, if any, for these contingencies is made after analysis of each known issue. Development of the analysis includes consideration of many factors including: potential exposure, the status of proceedings, negotiations, results of similar litigation and participation rates. The required accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. For further discussion, see the Contingencies footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. At year-end 2011 and 2010, the accrual for litigation costs amounted to $5 million and $4 million, respectively, and is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. 34 Table of Contents NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See New Accounting Pronouncements footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a description of new accounting pronouncements.
