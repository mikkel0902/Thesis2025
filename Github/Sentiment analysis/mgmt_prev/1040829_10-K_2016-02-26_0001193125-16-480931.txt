Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are a Delaware corporation, originally incorporated in 1956, that, following our REIT conversion, began operating as a self-advised and self-administered REIT for federal income tax purposes on January 1, 2013, specializing in group-oriented, destination hotel assets in urban and resort markets. Our owned assets include a network of four upscale, meetings-focused resorts totaling 7,795 rooms that are managed by Marriott International, Inc. ( Marriott ) under the Gaylord Hotels brand. These four resorts, which we refer to as our Gaylord Hotels properties, consist of the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee ( Gaylord Opryland ), the Gaylord Palms Resort & Convention Center near Orlando, Florida ( Gaylord Palms ), the Gaylord Texan Resort & Convention Center near Dallas, Texas ( Gaylord Texan ) and the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center near Washington D.C. ( Gaylord National ). Our other owned assets managed by Marriott include Gaylord Springs Golf Links ( Gaylord Springs ), the Wildhorse Saloon, the General Jackson Showboat ( General Jackson ), the Inn at Opryland (renamed from the Radisson Hotel at Opryland), a 303-room overflow hotel adjacent to Gaylord Opryland, and the AC Hotel at National Harbor, Washington D.C. ( AC Hotel ), a 192-room overflow hotel adjacent to Gaylord National that opened in April 2015. We also own and operate media and entertainment assets including the Grand Ole Opry, the legendary weekly showcase of country music finest performers for over 90 years; the Ryman Auditorium, the storied live music venue and former home of the Grand Ole Opry located in downtown Nashville; and WSM-AM, the Opry radio home. Each of our award-winning Gaylord Hotels properties incorporates not only high quality lodging, but also at least 400,000 square feet of meeting, convention and exhibition space, superb food and beverage options and retail and spa facilities within a single self-contained property. As a result, our Gaylord Hotels properties provide a convenient and entertaining environment for convention guests. Our Gaylord Hotels properties focus on the large group meetings market in the United States. In 2012, we completed restructuring transactions to facilitate our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Our goal is to become the nation premier hospitality REIT for group-oriented, destination hotel assets in urban and resort markets. Marriott manages the day-to-day operations of our Gaylord Hotels properties, the Inn at Opryland, the AC Hotel, and certain of our Nashville attractions. As a result, we rely upon Marriott to generate occupancy and revenue levels at our hotel properties. Our concentration in the hospitality industry, and in particular the large group meetings sector of the hospitality industry, exposes us to certain risks outside of our control. Past recessionary conditions in the national economy, including U.S. government sequestration, have previously resulted in economic pressures on the hospitality industry generally, and on our properties. For much of 2013, we experienced difficulties in in-the-year, for-the-year sales booking levels, as overall weakness in the group sector and difficulties related to the management transition to Marriott impacted our 2013 results. Joint efforts with Marriott resulted in improvements in the latter half of 2013 and in 2014 and 2015, including increased bookings over the prior year; however, we are continuing to work with Marriott in these areas to pursue further improvements. See Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors under Part I of this report for important information regarding forward-looking statements made in this report and risks and uncertainties we face. Dividend Policy and Share Repurchase Program Pursuant to our current dividend policy, we plan to pay a quarterly cash dividend to stockholders in an amount equal to an annualized payment of at least 50% of adjusted funds from operations (as defined by us) less maintenance capital expenditures, or 100% of REIT taxable income, whichever is greater. During 2015, the Company board of directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $2.70 per share of common stock, or an aggregate of $138.4 million in cash. During 2014, the Company board of directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $2.20 per share of common stock, or an aggregate of $112.0 million in cash. During 2013, the Company board of 32 Table of Contents directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $2.00 per share of common stock, or an aggregate of $101.7 million in cash. The declaration, timing and amount of dividends will be determined by future action of our board of directors. Our dividend policy may be altered at any time by our board of directors. On August 20, 2015, we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of our common stock using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit line. The repurchases are intended to be implemented through open market transactions on U.S. exchanges or in privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities laws, with any market purchases to be made during open trading window periods or pursuant to any applicable SEC Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The authorization extends until December 31, 2016. The timing, prices, and sizes of repurchases will depend upon prevailing market prices, general economic and market conditions and other considerations. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of stock. We did not make any repurchases under this authorization during 2015. Debt Transactions As further described below in Liquidity and Capital Resources Principal Debt Agreements, (i) in the first quarter of 2015, we cash settled the remaining 4.7 million warrants associated with our previously outstanding 3.75% convertible notes for total consideration of $154.7 million, (ii) in April 2015, certain of our subsidiaries completed the private placement of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due 2023 (the $400 Million 5% Senior Notes ), and (iii) in June 2015, we refinanced our credit facility by extending the maturity of the $700 million revolving credit facility for an additional two years and modifying certain covenants. Our term loan B in the original aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million (the term loan B ) under our credit facility remains outstanding. The $300 million senior secured term loan (the term loan A ) under our credit facility was paid off and eliminated with a substantial portion of the proceeds from the $400 Million 5% Senior Notes issuance. Our Current Operations Our ongoing operations are organized into three principal business segments: Hospitality, consisting of Gaylord Opryland, Gaylord Palms, Gaylord Texan, Gaylord National, the Inn at Opryland and the AC Hotel. Marriott manages each of our Gaylord Hotels properties, as well as the Inn at Opryland and the AC Hotel. Entertainment (previously referred to as Opry and Attractions), consisting of our Grand Ole Opry assets, WSM-AM and our Nashville attractions. As a result of the REIT conversion, we own our Entertainment businesses in TRSs, which conduct their business consistent with past practice, except for the management agreements with Marriott for the General Jackson, Wildhorse Saloon and Gaylord Springs discussed above. Corporate and Other, consisting of our corporate expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our total revenues were divided among these business segments as follows: Segment 2015 2014 2013 Hospitality 91 % 92 % 92 % Entertainment 9 % 8 % 8 % Corporate and Other 0 % 0 % 0 % Our goal is to become the nation premier hospitality REIT for group-oriented, destination hotel assets in urban and resort markets. We intend to leverage our existing hotel properties with All-in-One-Place self-contained service offerings, as well as a longer-term growth strategy that includes acquisitions of hotels, particularly in the group meetings sector of the hospitality industry, either alone or through joint ventures or alliances with one or more third parties. We intend to pursue attractive investment opportunities which meet our acquisition parameters, specifically, group-oriented large hotels and overflow hotels with existing or potential leisure appeal. 33 Table of Contents Key Performance Indicators The operating results of our Hospitality segment are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our hotels and the quality of the customer mix at our hotels, which are managed by Marriott. These factors impact the price that Marriott can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities, such as food and beverage and meeting space. The following key performance indicators are commonly used in the hospitality industry: hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate ( ADR ) a price indicator calculated by dividing room revenue by the number of rooms sold; Revenue per Available Room ( RevPAR ) a summary measure of hotel results calculated by dividing room revenue by room nights available to guests for the period; Total Revenue per Available Room ( Total RevPAR ) a summary measure of hotel results calculated by dividing the sum of room, food and beverage and other ancillary service revenue by room nights available to guests for the period; and Net Definite Room Nights Booked a volume indicator which represents the total number of definite bookings for future room nights at our hotels confirmed during the applicable period, net of cancellations. Hospitality segment revenue from our occupied hotel rooms is recognized as earned on the close of business each day and from concessions and food and beverage sales at the time of the sale. Attrition fees, which are charged to groups when they do not fulfill the minimum number of room nights or minimum food and beverage spending requirements originally contracted for, as well as cancellation fees, are recognized as revenue in the period they are collected. Almost all of our Hospitality segment revenues are either cash-based or, for meeting and convention groups meeting credit criteria, billed and collected on a short-term receivables basis. The hospitality industry is capital intensive, and we rely on the ability of our hotels to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing and fund maintenance capital expenditures. The results of operations of our Hospitality segment are affected by the number and type of group meetings and conventions scheduled to attend our hotels in a given period. A variety of factors can affect the results of any interim period, including the nature and quality of the group meetings and conventions attending our hotels during such period, which meetings and conventions have often been contracted for several years in advance, the level of attrition our hotels experience, and the level of transient business at our hotels during such period. Summary Financial Results The following table summarizes our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except percentages and per share data): 2015 % Change 2014 % Change 2013 Total revenues $ 1,092,124 4.9 % $ 1,040,991 9.1 % $ 954,562 Total operating expenses 930,062 4.8 % 887,886 1.1 % 878,374 Operating income 162,062 5.9 % 153,105 101.0 % 76,188 Net income 111,511 -11.8 % 126,452 6.8 % 118,352 Net income available to common shareholders 111,511 -7.9 % 121,035 6.7 % 113,483 Net income per share available to common shareholders fully diluted 2.16 -0.5 % 2.17 19.9 % 1.81 2015 Results As Compared to 2014 Results The increase in our total revenues during 2015, as compared to 2014, is attributable to increases in our Hospitality segment and Entertainment segment revenues of $40.4 million and $10.7 million, respectively, as discussed more fully below. Total Hospitality revenues in 2015 include $6.9 million in attrition and cancellation fee collections, a $2.0 million decrease from 2014. 34 Table of Contents The increase in total operating expenses during 2015, as compared to 2014, is primarily the result of impairment and other charges of $19.2 million incurred during 2015, as well as an increase in Hospitality segment and Entertainment segment expenses of $11.1 million and $7.5 million, respectively, as discussed more fully below. The above factors resulted in a $9.0 million increase in operating income for 2015, as compared to 2014. The $14.9 million decrease in our net income in 2015, as compared to 2014, was due to the change in our operating income described above, and the following factors, each as described more fully below: A $34.3 million decrease in other gains and losses for 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily associated with 2014 including a $26.1 million gain on the sale of our rights in a letter of intent which entitled us to a portion of an economic interest in the income from the land underlying the new MGM casino project in National Harbor, Maryland. Additionally, during 2015, we incurred a $16.0 million increase in the loss on the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities associated with portions of warrants related to our previous 3.75% convertible notes, partially offset by a $6.9 million gain associated with the reimbursement of costs that were previously incurred related to our proposed development in Aurora, Colorado. These costs were impaired in 2012 as part of our strategic shift away from long-term development, but were reimbursed in 2015 by the current developer. An increase in the benefit for income taxes of $10.4 million in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily attributable to a federal tax law change enacted in the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as changes in valuation allowance. 2014 Results As Compared to 2013 Results The increase in our total revenues during 2014, as compared to 2013, is attributable to increases in our Hospitality segment and Entertainment segment revenues of $75.7 million and $10.8 million, respectively, as discussed more fully below. Total Hospitality revenues in 2014 include $8.9 million in attrition and cancellation fee collections, a $0.4 million increase from 2013. The increase in total operating expenses during 2014, as compared to 2013, is primarily the result of an increase in hotel operating expenses of $34.4 million, partially offset by a lack of REIT conversion costs during 2014, as compared to $22.2 million in 2013, as discussed more fully below. The above factors resulted in a $76.9 million increase in operating income for 2014, as compared to 2013. The $8.1 million increase in our net income in 2014, as compared to 2013, was due to the change in our operating income described above, and the following factors, each as described more fully below: A decrease in the benefit for income taxes of $91.2 million in 2014, as compared to 2013. A $21.0 million increase in other gains and losses for 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily associated with a $26.1 million gain on the 2014 sale of our rights in a letter of intent which entitled us to a portion of an economic interest in the income from the land underlying the new MGM casino project in National Harbor, Maryland. Factors and Trends Contributing to Operating Performance in 2015 Compared to 2014 The most important factors and trends contributing to our operating performance in 2015 as compared to 2014 were: Increased outside-the-room spending at Gaylord Texan (6.0%) and Gaylord Opryland (4.3%) during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in banquet revenue. Increased occupancy at Gaylord Texan (an increase of 5.8 percentage points of occupancy, during 2015, as compared to 2014), primarily as a result of an increase in group business. Increased ADR at Gaylord Texan (an increase of 5.7% for 2015, as compared to 2014), primarily as a result of room rate increases for both groups and transient business. 35 Table of Contents Decreased occupancy at Gaylord Opryland (a decrease of 1.3 points of occupancy for 2015, as compared to 2014) primarily as a result of a norovirus outbreak and a severe weather winter storm, which took place during January and February 2015. In-the-year, for-the-year cancellations for 2015 decreased 6.2% as compared to 2014. Increased attrition levels for 2015, as compared to 2014, which partially offset the increase in operating income and Total RevPAR. Attrition for 2015 was 12.8% of bookings, compared to 10.6% in 2014. Increased net definite group room nights booked (an increase of 4.6% for 2015, as compared to 2014). Increased revenue for our Entertainment segment (an increase of 12.3% for 2015, as compared to 2014), primarily due to increased attendance and additional shows at the Grand Ole Opry, as well as increased ancillary business such as tours and retail. Factors and Trends Contributing to Operating Performance in 2014 Compared to 2013 The most important factors and trends contributing to our operating performance in 2014 as compared to 2013 were: Increased outside-the-room spending at each of our hotel properties (an increase of 9.4% during 2014, as compared to 2013), primarily due to increased levels of premium groups and the resulting increase in banquet revenues. Increased occupancy at Gaylord National and Gaylord Opryland (an increase of 5.1 percentage points of occupancy and 3.4 percentage points of occupancy, respectively, during 2014, as compared to 2013), primarily as a result of an increase in corporate and association group room nights. Increased ADR at Gaylord Opryland, Gaylord Texan and Gaylord Palms (an increase of 5.9%, 5.5% and 3.3%, respectively, for 2014, as compared to 2013), primarily as a result of room rate increases for both groups and transient. In-the-year, for-the-year cancellations for 2014 decreased 52.4% as compared to 2013. Increased net definite group room nights booked (an increase of 14.0% for 2014, as compared to 2013), as overall group performance metrics continue to improve and second quarter 2014 included a record number of bookings for second quarter. Increased revenue for our Entertainment segment (an increase of 14.2% for 2014, as compared to 2013), primarily as a result of increased attendance at the Grand Ole Opry House and Ryman Auditorium. The incurrence of $22.2 million in REIT conversion costs during 2013 that did not recur in 2014. Operating Results Detailed Segment Financial Information Hospitality Segment As a result of the updates to the hospitality industry Uniform System of Accounts for the Lodging Industry, Eleventh Revised Edition, as discussed further in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein, certain amounts in prior periods related to the Hospitality segment have been reclassified to conform to the 2015 presentation. 36 Table of Contents Total Segment Results.

Results of the AC Hotel are included as of its opening date in April 2015. (2) Hospitality operating income does not include REIT conversion costs of $7.6 million in 2013, impairment charges of $19.2 million and $2.8 million in 2015 and 2013, respectively, or preopening costs of $0.9 million during 2015. See the discussion of these items set forth below. (3) We calculate Hospitality RevPAR by dividing room revenue by room nights available to guests for the period. Hospitality RevPAR is not comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues. (4) We calculate Hospitality Total RevPAR by dividing the sum of room, food and beverage, and other ancillary services revenue (which equals Hospitality segment revenue) by room nights available to guests for the period. Hospitality Total RevPAR is not comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues. (5) Same-store Hospitality performance metrics do not include the AC Hotel, which opened in April 2015. The increase in total Hospitality segment revenue in 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014, is primarily due to increases in revenue of $18.1 million, $7.8 million and $5.1 million at Gaylord Texan, Gaylord Opryland and Gaylord National, respectively, as well as $7.0 million in revenue at the AC Hotel, which opened in April 2015. The increase is primarily a result of increased rooms revenue and outside-the-room spending during 2015 as a result of an increase in premium group business discussed below. The increase in total Hospitality segment revenue in 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013, is primarily due to increases of $30.3 million, $18.4 million, $15.7 million and $10.0 million at Gaylord Opryland, Gaylord National, Gaylord Texan and Gaylord Palms, respectively, primarily a result of increased rooms revenue and outside-the-room spending during 2014 as a result of an increase in premium group business discussed below. 37 Table of Contents The percentage of group versus transient business based on rooms sold for our hospitality segment for the years ended December 31 was approximately as follows: 2015 2014 2013 Group 72% 73% 72% Transient 28% 27% 28% The type of group based on rooms sold for our hospitality segment for the years ended December 31 was approximately as follows: 2015 2014 2013 Corporate Groups 51% 47% 47% Associations 35% 36% 34% Other Groups 14% 17% 19% The decrease in rooms operating expenses in 2015, as compared to 2014, is primarily attributable to a decrease at Gaylord Opryland, as described below, partially offset by rooms expense at the AC Hotel, which opened in April 2015. The increase in rooms operating expenses in 2014, as compared to 2013, is primarily attributable to increases at Gaylord National and Gaylord Opryland, as described below. The increase in food and beverage operating expenses in 2015, as compared to 2014, is attributable to increases at Gaylord Texan, Gaylord Opryland and Gaylord National, as described below.

Other hotel expenses for the years ended December 31 consist of the following (in thousands): 2015 % Change 2014 % Change 2013 Administrative employment costs $ 107,495 7.1 % $ 100,380 -0.8 % $ 101,157 Utilities 28,394 -2.3 % 29,049 10.7 % 26,242 Property taxes 31,683 3.6 % 30,576 2.5 % 29,823 Other 145,417 -4.2 % 151,831 7.2 % 141,608 Total other hotel expenses $ 312,989 0.4 % $ 311,836 4.4 % $ 298,830 Administrative employment costs include salaries and benefits for hotel administrative functions, including, among others, senior management, accounting, human resources, sales, conference services, engineering and security. Administrative employment costs increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to previously unfilled positions at Gaylord Opryland and Gaylord Texan, as well as increased benefit costs at Gaylord National. Utility costs decreased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to decreases at Gaylord National and Gaylord Palms. Property taxes increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of an increase at Gaylord Texan. Other expenses, which include supplies, advertising, maintenance costs and consulting costs, decreased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of decreases at each of our Gaylord Hotels properties. Administrative employment costs decreased slightly during 2014, as compared to 2013. Utility costs increased during 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase at Gaylord National as a result of increased rates.

As discussed above, each of our management agreements with Marriott for our Gaylord Hotels properties requires us to pay Marriott a base management fee of approximately 2% of gross revenues from the applicable property for each fiscal year or portion thereof. Additionally, an incentive fee is based on the profitability of our Gaylord Hotels properties calculated on a pooled basis. We incurred 38 Table of Contents $16.8 million, $19.1 million and $17.6 million in total base management fees to Marriott related to our Hospitality segment properties during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We also incurred $0.8 million related to incentive management fees for our Hospitality segment during 2015. We did not incur an incentive fee to Marriott related to our Hospitality segment properties during 2014 or 2013. Management fees are presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K net of the amortization of the deferred management rights proceeds discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included herein. Hospitality segment depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of an increase at Gaylord Texan, as described below, as well as depreciation for the AC Hotel, which opened in April 2015. Hospitality depreciation and amortization expense remained stable in 2014, as compared to 2013. Property-Level Results. The following presents property-level financial results for our Gaylord Hotels properties for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013: Gaylord Opryland Results. The results of Gaylord Opryland for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows (in thousands, except percentages and performance metrics): 2015 % Change 2014 % Change 2013 Revenues: Rooms $ 134,293 0.1% $ 134,225 10.8% $ 121,150 Food and beverage 134,321 7.3% 125,196 7.4% 114,323 Other hotel revenue 50,597 -2.8% 52,040 20.0% 45,645 Total revenue 319,211 2.5% 311,461 10.8% 281,118 Operating expenses: Rooms 33,133 -7.7% 35,899 9.2% 32,861 Food and beverage 73,689 6.2% 69,414 4.3% 66,555 Other hotel expenses 99,701 -1.0% 100,681 6.2% 94,837 Management fees 4,895 -7.4% 5,287 12.9% 4,683 Depreciation and amortization 30,793 -1.7% 31,318 -4.2% 32,683 Total operating expenses 242,211 -0.2% 242,599 4.7% 231,619 Hospitality performance metrics: Occupancy 74.9 % -1.7% 76.2 % 4.7% 72.8 % ADR $ 170.42 1.7% $ 167.53 5.9% $ 158.24 RevPAR $ 127.66 0.0% $ 127.60 10.8% $ 115.17 Total RevPAR $ 303.45 2.5% $ 296.09 10.8% $ 267.24 Rooms revenue and RevPAR were stable at Gaylord Opryland during 2015, as compared to 2014, as a decrease in occupancy was offset by an increase in ADR. These results were impacted by a rooms renovation project that resulted in approximately 18,000 room nights out of service during 2015. This project was completed in September 2015. The current year was also impacted by a norovirus outbreak that occurred in January and February 2015 at the property, as well as a winter storm that occurred during February 2015. Rooms expenses decreased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of decreased employment costs due to improved productivity. The increase in food and beverage revenue at Gaylord Opryland during 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to increased banquet revenues from corporate groups. Food and beverage expenses increased in 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in variable expenses related to the increase in revenue. Other revenue decreased at Gaylord Opryland during 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to a decrease in ancillary revenues, such as parking fees, related to the decrease in occupancy, as well as a decrease in attrition and cancellation fee collections. These decreases were partially offset by the receipt of $3.6 million in insurance proceeds related to the norovirus outbreak. Other hotel expenses decreased slightly in 2015, as compared to 2014. Depreciation and amortization decreased modestly during 2015, as compared to 2014. Rooms revenue and RevPAR increased at Gaylord Opryland during 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily as a result of the increase in occupancy, which was due to an increase in group business, and the increase in ADR, which was due to a favorable mix shift to more premium corporate and association groups, as well as an increase in transient rate. Rooms expenses increased during 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily as a result of increased variable expenses associated with the increase in occupancy. 39 Table of Contents The increase in food and beverage revenue at Gaylord Opryland during 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily due to increased revenue from banquets and restaurant outlets related to the increase in occupancy and the mix shift discussed above. Food and beverage expenses increased in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily as a result of the increase in variable expenses related to the increase in revenue, partially offset by decreases in food and employment costs due to more efficient inventory and labor management. Other revenue increased at Gaylord Opryland during 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in ancillary revenues, such as parking and resort fees related to the increase in occupancy, an increase in revenues associated with our annual Christmas programs, and an increase in attrition and cancellation fee collections. Other hotel expenses increased in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to increased sales and marketing costs associated with the increase in premium group rooms and an increase in property taxes due to an increased valuation, as well as the incurrence of a $0.6 million settlement with the Federal Communications Commission during 2014. Depreciation and amortization decreased during 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily as a result of furniture, fixtures and equipment placed in service during a 2005 rooms renovation becoming fully depreciated during 2013.

Other hotel expenses increased in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily as a result of increased utility and employment costs. Depreciation and amortization decreased slightly during 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily as a result of a portion of the initial furniture, fixtures and equipment placed in service at the property opening in 2008 becoming fully depreciated during 2013. Entertainment Segment (previously Opry and Attractions) The following presents the financial results of our Entertainment segment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except percentages): 2015 % Change 2014 % Change 2013 Revenues $ 97,521 12.3% $ 86,825 14.2% $ 76,053 Operating expenses 67,363 12.6% 59,815 5.8% 56,528 Depreciation and amortization 5,747 9.3% 5,258 -2.0% 5,368 Operating income (1) $ 24,411 12.2% $ 21,752 53.6% $ 14,157 (1) Entertainment segment operating income for 2013 does not include $0.2 million and $0.2 million of REIT conversion costs and impairment charges, respectively. See the discussion of these items set forth below. The increases in revenues in the Entertainment segment during 2015, as compared to 2014, were primarily due to increased attendance and additional shows at the Grand Ole Opry, as well as increased ancillary business such as tours and retail. The increases in revenues in the Entertainment segment during 2014, as compared to 2013, were primarily due to increases at the Grand Ole Opry and the Ryman Auditorium, driven by increased attendance. Entertainment operating expenses increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of the increased variable costs associated with the increase in shows and ancillary revenue, as well as increased consulting costs.

See the discussion of these items set forth below. Corporate and Other operating expenses, which consist primarily of costs associated with senior management salaries and benefits, legal, human resources, accounting, pension and other administrative costs, increased during 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of the pension settlement charge discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included herein, partially offset by a decrease in employment benefit costs. Corporate and Other operating expenses increased during 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in employee benefit and consulting costs. Corporate and Other depreciation and amortization expense decreased during 2015, as compared to 2014, and in 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily due to the continued disposal of certain assets that were no longer required as a result of our conversion to a REIT. Operating Results REIT Conversion Costs We have segregated all costs related to the REIT conversion from normal operations and reported these amounts as REIT conversion costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During 2013, we incurred $22.2 million of various costs associated with these transactions, including employment and severance costs ($14.4 million), professional fees ($2.7 million), and various other transition costs ($5.1 million). No REIT conversion costs were incurred during 2015 or 2014. Operating Results Casualty Loss During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized $0.1 million of casualty loss expense related to the May 2010 flooding in Nashville, which primarily represents non-capitalized repairs within our Entertainment segment. Operating Results Preopening costs We expense the costs associated with start-up activities and organization costs as incurred. Our preopening costs for 2015 and 2014 primarily relate to the AC Hotel. Operating Results Impairment and Other Charges Impairment charges in 2015 include costs associated with our decision to move forward with an expansion of the guest rooms and convention space at Gaylord Texan. This capital project replaced a previously contemplated expansion that we began incurring design costs for during 2007 and had been subsequently put on hold. As the new project will be substantially different from the previously contemplated project, we incurred an impairment charge of $16.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, during 2015, we incurred $2.9 million in impairment charges related to assets previously used in special events programming that is being discontinued. During 2013, we incurred $3.0 million in impairment charges, primarily associated with disposed equipment at Gaylord National and the decision not to move forward with a proposed expansion at Gaylord Palms in the near-term. 44 Table of Contents Non-Operating Results Affecting Net Income General The following table summarizes the other factors which affected our net income for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except percentages): 2015 % Change 2014 % Change 2013 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized $ (63,901 ) 4.0 % $ (61,447 ) 0.9 % $ (60,916 ) Interest income 12,384 2.6 % 12,075 -1.6 % 12,267 Net loss on extinguishment of debt -100.0 % (2,148 ) -48.6 % (4,181 ) Other gains and (losses) (10,889 ) -146.5 % 23,400 903.4 % 2,332 Benefit for income taxes 11,855 708.1 % 1,467 -98.4 % 92,662 Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, increased $2.5 million to $63.9 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, due primarily to increased interest expense associated with our $400 Million 5% Senior Notes, which we issued in April 2015, and increased interest expense on our term loan B facility, which we entered into in June 2014. We also incurred $1.9 million in interest expense during 2015 related to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the refinancing of our credit facility. These increases were partially offset by the lack of interest expense associated with our 3.75% convertible notes, which matured in October 2014, and a decrease in interest expense associated with our credit facility due to a decrease in borrowings. Our weighted average interest rate on our borrowings, excluding the write-off of deferred financing costs during the period, was 4.2% in 2015 as compared to 4.9% in 2014. Cash interest expense increased $9.8 million to $56.6 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, and noncash interest expense, which includes amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts, the write-off of deferred financing costs, and capitalized interest, decreased $7.4 million to $7.3 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, increased $0.5 million to $61.4 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, due primarily to interest associated with our $400 million term loan B facility, which we entered into in June 2014 and an increase in interest expense associated with our $350 million 5% senior notes that were issued in April 2013, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with our 3.75% convertible notes, which were partially repurchased at various points in 2013 and 2014 with the balance paid at maturity in October 2014. Our weighted average interest rate on our borrowings, excluding the write-off of deferred financing costs during the period, was 4.9% in 2014 as compared to 5.0% in 2013. Cash interest expense increased $7.1 million to $46.8 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, and noncash interest expense decreased $6.6 million to $14.6 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. Interest Income Interest income for 2015, 2014 and 2013 primarily includes amounts earned on the bonds that we received in April 2008 in connection with the development of Gaylord National, which we hold as notes receivable. Net Loss on Extinguishment of Debt During 2014, we settled the repurchase of and subsequently cancelled $56.3 million of our 3.75% convertible notes in private transactions for aggregate consideration of $120.2 million. In addition, we settled the conversion of $15.3 million of convertible notes that were converted by holders. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.1 million in 2014 as a result of these transactions. In 2013, we settled the repurchase of and subsequently cancelled $54.7 million of our 3.75% convertible notes in private transactions for aggregate consideration of $98.6 million. In addition, we settled $1.2 million of convertible notes that were converted by a holder. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $4.2 million in 2013. Other Gains and (Losses) Other gains and (losses) for 2015 and 2014 includes $20.2 million and $4.2 million, respectively, in losses on the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities associated with portions of the warrants associated with our 3.75% convertible notes. Other gains and (losses) for 2015, 2014 and 2013 includes $2.5 million, $2.4 million and $2.3 million, respectively, from a fund associated with the 45 Table of Contents Gaylord National bonds to reimburse us for certain marketing and maintenance expenses. Other gains and (losses) for 2015 also includes a $6.9 million gain associated with the reimbursement of costs that were previously incurred related to our proposed development in Aurora, Colorado. These costs were impaired in 2012 as part of our strategic shift away from long-term development, but reimbursed in 2015 by the current developer. Other gains and (losses) for 2014 also includes a $26.1 million gain associated with the sale of our rights in a letter of intent which entitled us to a portion of an economic interest in the income from the land underlying the new MGM casino project in National Harbor, Maryland. Benefit for Income Taxes As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on ordinary taxable income and capital gains income from real estate investments that we distribute to our stockholders. We will, however, be subject to corporate income taxes on built-in gains (the excess of fair market value over tax basis at January 1, 2013) that result from gains on certain assets. In addition, we will continue to be required to pay federal and state corporate income taxes on earnings of our TRSs. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded an income tax benefit of $11.9 million, $1.5 million and $92.7 million, respectively. As a result of our conversion to a REIT in 2013, certain net deferred tax liabilities related to our real estate were reversed, as the REIT will generally not pay federal corporate income tax related to those deferred tax liabilities. In addition, we assessed the need for a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of the TRSs. As a result, we recorded a net benefit of $64.8 million related to the conversion to a REIT during 2013. In addition, in 2013 we recorded a benefit of $7.5 million related to the reversal of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions, a benefit of $1.2 million related to the filing of our 2012 federal and state income tax returns and a benefit of $19.2 million related to our current period operations. The increase in our benefit for income taxes for 2015, as compared to 2014, resulted primarily from a federal tax law change enacted in the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as a decrease in valuation allowance required at the TRSs. Because the TRSs are in a cumulative loss position, the deferred tax asset realization depends entirely on the reversal of existing future taxable differences, which fluctuate based on the current year change in deferred tax balances. The decrease in our benefit for income taxes for 2014, as compared to 2013, resulted primarily from the benefit of our conversion to a REIT effective January 1, 2013, as discussed above. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows from Operating Activities . Cash flow from operating activities is the principal source of cash used to fund our operating expenses, interest payments on debt, maintenance capital expenditures, and dividends to stockholders. During 2015, our net cash flows provided by our operating activities were $234.5 million, reflecting primarily our income before depreciation expense, amortization expense, impairment and other charges, income tax benefit, stock-based compensation expense, loss on repurchase of warrants, and other non-cash charges of approximately $265.5 million and unfavorable changes in working capital of approximately $31.0 million. The unfavorable changes in working capital primarily resulted from a decrease in accrued expenses as a result of the timing of payments and an increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of collections. During 2014, our net cash flows provided by our operating activities were $247.0 million, reflecting primarily our income before depreciation expense, amortization expense, income tax benefit, gain on sale of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation expense, and other non-cash charges of approximately $234.4 million and favorable changes in working capital of approximately $12.6 million. The favorable changes in working capital primarily resulted from a decrease in accounts receivable due to the timing of collections and an increase in accrued expenses as a result of the timing of payments. During 2013, our net cash flows provided by our operating activities were $137.7 million, reflecting primarily our income before depreciation expense, amortization expense, income tax benefit, stock-based compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, and other non-cash charges of approximately $185.7 million, partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital of approximately $48.0 million. The unfavorable changes in working capital primarily resulted from a decrease in accrued expenses primarily related to the payment of accrued REIT conversion costs and a decrease in accounts payable at our managed properties due to the timing of payments as new payment processes were developed, partially offset by an increase in accrued dividends. It should be noted that the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the recognition of valuation allowances on the net deferred tax assets of our TRSs represent the majority of the reconciling item for benefit for deferred income taxes of $89.5 million from net income to net cash flows provided by operating activities. These tax items, and their related impact on our cash provided by operating activities, are the result of our REIT conversion, and we paid out no cash in connection with such reversal and recognition. 46 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities . During 2015 our primary uses of funds for investing activities were purchases of property and equipment, which totaled $79.8 million, and an increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents associated with the furniture, fixtures and equipment ( FF&E ) reserve we are obligated to maintain for future planned and emergency-related capital expenditures at the properties that Marriott manages for us. These uses of cash were partially offset by the receipt of $10.0 million in proceeds related to the sale of our rights in a letter of intent which entitled us to a portion of an economic interest in the income from the land underlying the new MGM casino project in National Harbor, Maryland. Purchases of property, plant and equipment consisted primarily of an expansion of the Ryman Auditorium, the renovation of a portion of the guest rooms at Gaylord Opryland, and ongoing maintenance capital expenditures for our existing properties. During 2014 our primary uses of funds for investing activities were purchases of property and equipment, which totaled $58.4 million, and payments made associated with the purchase of the AC Hotel of $21.2 million, partially offset by the receipt of $9.4 million in proceeds related to the sale of our rights in the letter of intent discussed above. Purchases of property, plant and equipment consisted primarily of a rooms renovation project at Gaylord Texan, ongoing maintenance capital expenditures for our existing properties, and $0.2 million of capitalized personnel costs. During 2013, our primary uses of funds from investing activities were purchases of property and equipment of $37.0 million, consisting primarily of ongoing maintenance capital expenditures for our existing properties, and included $0.5 million of capitalized personnel costs, and an increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents associated with the FF&E reserve. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Our cash flows from financing activities reflect primarily the incurrence of and the repayment of long-term debt, the repurchase of stock, and the payment of dividends. During 2015, our net cash flows used in financing activities were approximately $179.8 million, primarily reflecting $280.1 million in repayments under our credit facility, the payment of $154.7 million to cash settle the remaining 4.7 million warrants associated with our 3.75% convertible notes, the payment of $131.3 million in cash dividends, and the payment of $11.2 million in deferred financing costs, partially offset by the issuance of $400.0 million in senior notes. During 2014, our net cash flows used in financing activities were approximately $172.7 million, primarily reflecting the payment of $177.4 million to cash settle 7.3 million of the warrants associated with our 3.75% convertible notes, the payment of $109.4 million in cash dividends, and the payment of $8.4 million in deferred financing costs. In addition, we paid $126.5 million in cash related to repurchases and the settlement of conversions of our 3.75% convertible notes prior to maturity and paid $232.2 million to repay the remaining 3.75% convertible notes at maturity. These outflows were partially offset by $398.0 million in net borrowings under our term loan B facility and $77.0 million in net borrowings under our credit facility. During 2013, our net cash flows used in financing activities were approximately $124.5 million, primarily reflecting the payment of $152.2 million to redeem all of our outstanding 6.75% senior notes, $100.0 million to repurchase 2.3 million shares of our common stock for retirement, $98.6 million to repurchase and cancel $54.7 million of our Convertible Notes in private transactions, the payment of $76.4 million in cash dividends, net repayments of $35.5 million under our credit facility, and the payment of $15.7 million in deferred financing costs, partially offset by the issuance of $350.0 million in $350 million 5% senior notes and $5.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Liquidity As of December 31, 2015, we had $56.3 million in unrestricted cash and $391.8 million available for borrowing under our credit facility, which we refinanced in June 2015 with an extended maturity to 2019. During 2015, we net repaid $280.1 million under our credit facility, cash settled the remaining 4.7 million warrants associated with our 3.75% convertible notes for $154.7 million, paid cash dividends of $131.3 million and incurred capital expenditures of $79.8 million. These outflows, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of $400.0 million in senior notes during April 2015 and cash flows provided by operations discussed above, were the primary factors in the decrease in our cash balance from 2014 to 2015. We currently plan to declare dividends of $3.00 per share in 2016, payable in equal quarterly amounts, subject to future determinations as to the timing and amount by our board of directors. We anticipate investing in our operations during 2016 by spending between $115 million and $125 million in capital expenditures, which primarily includes ongoing maintenance capital of our current facilities, a freestanding event ballroom and expanded event space at Gaylord National, an expansion of the guest rooms and convention space at Gaylord Texan, and a room renovation at Gaylord Opryland. 47 Table of Contents We believe that our cash on hand and cash from operations will be adequate to fund our other short-term commitments, as well as: (i) normal operating expenses, (ii) interest expense on long-term debt obligations, (iii) capital lease and operating lease obligations, and (iv) declared dividends. If our existing cash and cash from operations were inadequate to fund such commitments, we could draw on our credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of covenants in the credit facility. We believe that drawing on this credit facility will not be necessary for general working capital purposes. We may, however, draw on our credit facility for operational and capital needs or other needs in the future. Our outstanding principal debt agreements, none of which mature prior to 2019, are described below. Based on current projections for compliance under our financial covenants contained in these agreements, we do not foresee a maturity issue prior to their scheduled maturity date. Principal Debt Agreements As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our outstanding debt. Credit Facility . On June 5, 2015, we entered into Amendment No. 2 (the Amendment ) among the Company, as a guarantor, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, certain other subsidiaries of the Company party thereto, as guarantors, the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, to the Company Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Facility ). Prior to the Amendment, the Credit Facility consisted of a $700.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the revolving credit facility ), the term loan A, and the term loan B. Following the Amendment, the Credit Facility consists of the revolving credit facility and the term loan B, which matures on January 15, 2021. We paid off the previously outstanding Term Loan A during the second quarter of 2015 with a substantial portion of the proceeds from the Operating Partnership and RHP Finance Corporation ( Finco ) private placement of the $400 Million 5% Senior Notes, and the term loan A was eliminated. Pursuant to the Amendment, we extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility under the Credit Facility to June 5, 2019 and provided for two additional six-month extension options, at our election. In addition, the Amendment lowered the adjustable margin (the Applicable Margin ) for determining the interest rate on revolving loans based on our consolidated funded indebtedness to total asset value ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility). Interest on our borrowings under the revolving credit facility is payable quarterly, in arrears, for base rate-based loans and at the end of each interest rate period for LIBOR-based loans. The effective interest rate at December 31, 2015 was LIBOR plus 1.60%. Principal is payable in full at maturity. Further, the unused commitment fee was reduced to 0.2% to 0.3% per year of the average unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The Credit Facility continues to be guaranteed by us, each of our four wholly-owned subsidiaries that own the Gaylord Hotels properties, and certain other of our subsidiaries. The Credit Facility continues to be secured by (i) a first mortgage lien on the real property of each of our Gaylord Hotels properties, (ii) pledges of equity interests in our subsidiaries that own the Gaylord Hotels properties, (iii) our personal property and the personal property of the Operating Partnership and our subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Facility, and (iv) all proceeds and products from our Gaylord Hotels properties. Advances are subject to a 55% borrowing base, based on the appraisal value of the Gaylord Hotels properties (reduced to 50% in the event a hotel property is sold). In addition, the Credit Facility contains certain covenants which, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, investments, dividends, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, liens and encumbrances and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. The material financial covenants, ratios or tests contained in the Credit Facility are as follows: We must maintain a consolidated funded indebtedness to total asset value ratio as of the end of each calendar quarter of not more than .65 to 1.0. We must maintain a consolidated tangible net worth (as defined in the Credit Facility) of not less than $175 million plus 75% of the proceeds received by us or any of our subsidiaries in connection with any equity issuance. We must maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Facility, of not less than 1.50 to 1.00. We must maintain an implied debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of adjusted net operating income to monthly principal and interest that would be required if the outstanding balance were amortized over 25 years at an assumed fixed rate) of not less than 1.60 to 1.00. 48 Table of Contents If an event of default shall occur and be continuing under the Credit Facility, the commitments under the Credit Facility may be terminated and the principal amount outstanding under the Credit Facility, together with all accrued unpaid interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, may be declared immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2015, $306.4 million of borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Facility, and the lending banks had issued $1.8 million of letters of credit under the facility, which left $391.8 million of availability under the Credit Facility (subject to the satisfaction of debt incurrence tests under the indentures governing our $350 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2021 (the $350 Million 5% Senior Notes ) and $400 Million 5% Senior Notes. As a result of the Amendment, we wrote off $1.9 million of deferred financing costs during 2015, which is included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. $400 Million Term B Loan Facility. On June 18, 2014, we amended the Credit Facility such that we added an additional senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $400.0 million to the Credit Facility. Proceeds from the term loan B were used to repay revolving loans under the Credit Facility, to repay our 3.75% convertible notes and to settle a part of the warrant transactions described below. The term loan B has a maturity date of January 15, 2021 and borrowings bear interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus an adjustable margin, subject to a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. At December 31, 2015, the interest rate on the term loan B was LIBOR plus 2.75%. The term loan B amortizes in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.0% of the original principal amount of $400.0 million, commencing on September 30, 2014, with the balance due at maturity. Amounts borrowed under the term loan B that are repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. At closing, we drew down on the term loan B in full. Consistent with our other loans under our Credit Facility, the term loan B is guaranteed by the Company, each of our four wholly-owned subsidiaries that own the Gaylord Hotels-branded properties, and certain other of our subsidiaries. The term loan B is secured by (i) a first mortgage lien on the real property of each of our Gaylord Hotels properties, (ii) pledges of equity interests in our subsidiaries that own the Gaylord Hotels properties, (iii) the personal property of the Company, the Operating Partnership and the guarantors and (iv) all proceeds and products from our Gaylord Hotels properties. Amounts drawn on the term loan B are subject to a 55% borrowing base, based on the appraisal value of the Gaylord Hotels properties (reduced to 50% in the event a hotel property is sold). The term loan B is subject to certain covenants contained in the Credit Facility, which, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, investments, dividends, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, liens and encumbrances and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. The term loan B is subject to substantially all of the events of default provided for the Credit Facility (other than the financial maintenance covenants). If an event of default shall occur and be continuing, the commitments under the term loan B may be terminated and the principal amount outstanding under the term loan B, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, may be declared immediately due and payable. $350 Million 5% Senior Notes. On April 3, 2013, the Operating Partnership and RHP Finance Corporation, a subsidiary of the Company, completed the private placement of $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2021, which are guaranteed by the Company and its subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Facility. The $350 Million 5% Senior Notes and guarantees were issued pursuant to an indenture by and among the issuing subsidiaries and the guarantors and U.S. Bank National Association as trustee. The $350 Million 5% Senior Notes have a maturity date of April 15, 2021 and bear interest at 5% per annum, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The $350 Million 5% Senior Notes are general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the issuing subsidiaries and rank equal in right of payment with such subsidiaries existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to future subordinated indebtedness, if any. The $350 Million 5% Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to the issuing subsidiaries secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The guarantees rank equally in right of payment with the applicable guarantor existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of such guarantor. The $350 Million 5% Senior Notes will be effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness of any guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations of the Operating Partnership subsidiaries that do not guarantee the $350 Million 5% Senior Notes. The issuing subsidiaries may redeem the $350 Million 5% Senior Notes on or before April 15, 2016, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date plus a make-whole redemption premium. The $350 Million 5% Senior Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, 49 Table of Contents at any time on or after April 15, 2016 at a redemption price expressed as a percentage of the principal amount thereof, which percentage is 103.75%, 102.50%, 101.25%, and 100.00% beginning on April 15 of 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. In connection with the issuance of the $350 Million 5% Senior Notes, we completed a registered offer to exchange the $350 Million 5% Senior Notes for registered notes with substantially identical terms as the $350 Million 5% Senior Notes in November 2013. $400 Million 5% Senior Notes . On April 14, 2015, the Operating Partnership and Finco completed the private placement of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2023. The $400 Million 5% Senior Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company issuing subsidiaries and are guaranteed by the Company and its subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Facility. The $400 Million 5% Senior Notes and guarantees were issued pursuant to an indenture by and among the issuing subsidiaries and the guarantors and U.S. Bank National Association as trustee. The $400 Million 5% Senior Notes have a maturity date of April 15, 2023 and bear interest at 5% per annum, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning October 15, 2015. The $400 Million 5% Senior Notes are general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the issuing subsidiaries and rank equal in right of payment with such subsidiaries existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, including the $350 Million 5% Senior Notes, and senior in right of payment to future subordinated indebtedness, if any. The $400 Million 5% Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to the issuing subsidiaries secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The guarantees rank equally in right of payment with the applicable guarantor existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of such guarantor. The $400 Million 5% Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness of any guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations of the Operating Partnership subsidiaries that do not guarantee the $400 Million 5% Senior Notes. The issuing subsidiaries may redeem the $400 Million 5% Senior Notes before April 15, 2018, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date plus a make-whole redemption premium. The $400 Million 5% Senior Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after April 15, 2018 at a redemption price expressed as a percentage of the principal amount thereof, which percentage is 103.75%, 102.50%, 101.25%, and 100.00% beginning on April 15 of 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. The net proceeds from the issuance of the $400 Million 5% Senior Notes totaled approximately $392 million, after deducting the initial purchasers discounts, commissions and offering expenses. We used substantially all of these proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our previous term loan A, eliminating the term loan A, and to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility portion of the Credit Facility. In connection with the issuance of the $400 Million 5% Senior Notes, we completed a registered offer to exchange the $400 Million 5% Senior Notes for registered notes with substantially identical terms as the $400 Million 5% Senior Notes in September 2015. Additional Debt Limitations . Pursuant to the terms of the management agreements and pooling agreement with Marriott, we are subject to certain debt limitations described below. The management agreements provide for the following limitations on indebtedness encumbering a hotel: The aggregate principal balance of all mortgage and mezzanine debt encumbering the hotel shall be no greater than 75% of the fair market value of the hotel; and The ratio of (a) aggregate Operating Profit (as defined in the management agreement) in the 12 months prior to the closing on the mortgage or mezzanine debt to (b) annual debt service for the hotel shall equal or exceed 1.2:1; but is subject to the pooling agreement described below. The pooled limitations on Secured Debt (as defined in the pooling agreement) are as follows: The aggregate principal balance of all mortgage and mezzanine debt on Pooled Hotels (as defined in the pooling agreement), shall be no more than 75% of the fair market value of Pooled Hotels. 50 Table of Contents The ratio of (a) aggregate Operating Profit (as defined in the pooling agreement) of Pooled Hotels in the 12 months prior to closing on any mortgage or mezzanine debt, to (b) annual debt service for the Pooled Hotels, shall equal or exceed 1.2:1. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We enter into commitments under letters of credit, primarily for the purpose of securing our deductible obligations with our insurers, and lending banks under our credit facility had issued $1.8 million of letters of credit at December 31, 2015. Except as set forth in this paragraph, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonable likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Commitments and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015, including long-term debt and operating and capital lease commitments (amounts in thousands): Contractual obligations Total amounts committed Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years After 5 years Long-term debt (1) $ 1,456,400 $ 6,000 $ $ 306,400 $ 1,144,000 Capital leases 678 19 40 43 576 Operating leases (2) 622,723 4,716 8,627 9,091 600,289 Construction commitments (3) 21,205 21,205 Total contractual obligations $ 2,101,006 $ 31,940 $ 8,667 $ 315,534 $ 1,744,865 (1) Long-term debt commitments do not include approximately $327.4 million in interest payments projected to be due in future years (less than 1 year $57.4 million; 1-3 years $114.4 million; 3-5 years $104.1 million; more than 5 years $51.5 million) based on the stated interest rates on our fixed-rate debt and the rates in effect at December 31, 2015 for our variable-rate debt. Variable rates, as well as outstanding principal balances, could change in future periods. See Principal Debt Agreements above for a discussion of our outstanding long-term debt. See Supplemental Cash Flow Information in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of the interest we paid during 2015, 2014 and 2013. (2) Total operating lease commitments of $622.7 million includes the 75-year operating lease agreement we entered into during 1999 for 65.3 acres of land located in Osceola County, Florida where Gaylord Palms is located. (3) With respect to our properties that are operated under management agreements with Marriott, we are obligated to maintain an FF&E reserve account for future planned and emergency-related capital expenditures at these properties. The amount funded into each of these reserve accounts is determined pursuant to the management agreements. For fiscal year 2016, the amount funded into the reserve accounts will be 5.0% of the respective properties total annual revenue. As of December 31, 2015, $21.2 million was held in FF&E reserve accounts for future capital expenditures at our properties. According to the terms of each management agreement with Marriott, the reserve funds are to be held by Marriott in a restricted cash account. Although it is not required that such funds be expended in a given year, each management agreement provides any excess funds will carry over for use in future years. Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash payments associated with our defined benefit pension plan, our non-qualified retirement plan and our defined benefit postretirement health care and life insurance plan, we cannot make reasonably certain estimates of the period of cash settlement. Therefore, these obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. During 2016, we expect to contribute $0, $0.9 million and $0.4 million, respectively, to our defined benefit pension plan, our non-qualified retirement plan and our defined benefit postretirement health care and life insurance plan. See Note 7 and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion related to these obligations. 51 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accounting estimates are an integral part of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the financial reporting process and are based upon current judgments. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their complexity and the possibility that future events affecting them may differ materially from our current judgments and estimates. This listing of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for management judgment regarding accounting policy. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Revenue recognition. Revenue from our occupied hotel rooms is recognized as earned on the close of business each day and from concessions and food and beverage sales at the time of the sale. Revenues from other services at our hotels, such as spa, parking, and transportation services are recognized at the time services are provided. Cancellation fees, as well as attrition fees, which are charged to groups when they do not fulfill the minimum number of room nights or minimum food and beverage spending requirements originally contracted for, are recognized as revenue in the period they are collected. Revenues from the Entertainment segment are recognized when services are provided or goods are shipped, as applicable. Impairment of long-lived and other assets. In accounting for our long-lived and other assets (including our notes receivable associated with the development of Gaylord National), we assess our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets that will continue to be used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset or asset group carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows, the asset group is considered to be impaired. The impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value, which is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses that utilize comprehensive cash flow projections, as well as observable market data to the extent available. Stock-based compensation. For stock option awards, we record compensation expense equal to the fair value of each stock option award granted on a straight line basis over the option vesting period. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula, which requires various judgmental assumptions including expected volatility, expected term, expected dividend yield, and expected risk-free rate of return. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our stock. We use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. The assumptions for expected volatility, expected term, and expected dividend yield are the assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value. The expected risk-free rate of return is not significant to the calculation of fair value. For awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units, we measure compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant. The fair value of time-based awards is determined based on the closing trading price of our common shares on the measurement date, which is generally the date of grant. The fair value of performance-based awards based on a market condition is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. A Monte Carlo simulation requires the use of a number of assumptions, including historical volatility and correlation of the price of our common shares and the price of the common shares of a peer group, a risk-free rate of return, and an expected term. For time-based awards, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. For performance-based awards, compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each award. For both time-based awards and performance-based awards, once the total amount of compensation expense is determined on the date of the grant, no adjustments are made to the amount recognized each period, unless there is a change to a non-market condition assumption. No compensation expense is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service. 52 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our fixed assets. Amortization expense for leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets. The lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions, including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets, as well as specific market and economic conditions. While management believes its estimates are reasonable, a change in the estimated lives could affect our depreciation expense in future periods. Income taxes. As a REIT, generally we will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on ordinary taxable income and capital gains income from real estate investments that we distribute to our stockholders. We will, however, be subject to corporate income taxes on built-in gains (the excess of fair market value over tax basis at January 1, 2013) that result from gains on certain assets. In addition, we will continue to be required to pay federal and state corporate income taxes on earnings of our TRSs. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes is increased by recording a reserve, in the form of a valuation allowance, against the estimated deferred tax assets that will not ultimately be recoverable. In addition, we must deal with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in the calculation of tax liabilities and are subject to routine income tax audits. We provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. We make this assessment based on only the technical merits of the tax position. The technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements and a liability for unrecognized tax benefits is established. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. To the extent that we prevail in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or are required to pay amounts in excess of the liability established, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected. Retirement and postretirement benefits other than pension plans. The costs and obligations of our retirement and postretirement benefits other than pension plans recognized in our consolidated financial statements are determined from actuarial valuations, which are dependent on significant assumptions, judgments, and estimates. These assumptions, judgments, and estimates, which include discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled at the measurement date, expected return on plan assets and mortality rates, are evaluated at each annual measurement date. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from these assumptions, judgments, and estimates are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. The discount rate utilized for determining future benefit obligations is based on the market rate of a broad-based index of high-quality bonds receiving an AA- or better rating from a recognized rating agency on our annual measurement date that is matched to the future expected cash flows of the benefit plans by annual periods. The resulting discount rate increased from 3.7% for the retirement plan and 3.3% for the postretirement benefits other than pension plans at December 31, 2014 to 3.9% and 3.6%, respectively, at December 31, 2015. We determine the overall expected long-term return on plan assets based on our estimate of the return that plan assets will provide over the period that benefits are expected to be paid out. In preparing this estimate, we assess the rates of return on each allocation of plan assets, return premiums generated by portfolio management, and advice by our third-party actuary and investment consultants. The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption that is determined at the beginning of each year and generally does not significantly change annually. While historical returns are considered, the rate of return assumption is primarily based on projections of expected returns, using economic data and financial models to estimate the probability of returns. The probability distribution of annualized returns for the portfolio using current asset allocations is used to determine the expected range of returns for a ten-to-twenty year horizon. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension expense. The expected return on plan assets assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for 2015 and 2014 was 6.5% and 7.5%, respectively. Actual return on plan assets for 2015 and 2014 was (2.9)% and 5.3%, respectively. Our historical actual return averaged 5.9% for the ten-year period ended December 31, 2015. In the future, we may make additional discretionary contributions to the plan or we could be required to make mandatory cash funding payments. 53 Table of Contents The mortality rate assumption used for determining future benefit obligations as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was based on the RP 2014 Mortality Tables. In estimating the health care cost trend rate, we consider our actual health care cost experience, industry trends, and advice from our third-party actuary. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expense. For example, holding all other assumptions constant, a 1% increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate related to the retirement plan would increase or decrease, respectively, 2015 net periodic pension expense by approximately $0.2 million. Likewise, a 1% increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase, respectively, 2015 net periodic pension expense by approximately $0.7 million. Legal Contingencies. We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances.
