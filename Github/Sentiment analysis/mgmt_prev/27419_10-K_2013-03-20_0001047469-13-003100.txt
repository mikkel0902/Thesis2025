Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. The 2012 period includes 53 weeks, while 2011 and 2010 each consisted of 52 weeks. Consolidated revenues were $73,301 million for 2012, an increase of $3,436 million or 4.9 percent from the prior year. Consolidated earnings before interest expense and income taxes for 2012 increased by $49 million or 0.9 percent over 2011 to $5,371 million. Cash flow provided by operations was $5,325 million, $5,434 million and $5,271 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Diluted earnings per share in 2012 increased 5.6 percent to $4.52 from $4.28 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which we believe is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our U.S. operations, increased 7.9 percent to $4.76 in 2012 from $4.41 in the prior year. Earnings Per Share Percent Change 2012 (a) 2011 2010 2012/2011 2011/2010 GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 4.52 $ 4.28 $ 4.00 5.6 % 7.0 % Adjustments (b) 0.24 0.13 (0.14 ) Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 4.76 $ 4.41 $ 3.86 7.9 % 14.3 % Note: A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided on page 22. (a) Consisted of 53 weeks. (b) Adjustments represent the diluted EPS impact of our 2013 Canadian market entry, the gain on receivables held for sale, favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the loss on early retirement of debt. Our 2012 financial results in our U.S. Retail Segment reflect increased sales of 5.1 percent over the same period last year due to a 2.7 percent comparable-store increase, the contribution from new stores and the additional week in 2012. Our 2012 U.S. Retail Segment earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin rate decreased slightly from the prior period, primarily due to a lower gross margin rate from our 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program and our store remodel program. Our earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) margin rate remained consistent with the prior year due to a decrease in our depreciation and amortization rate. 14 Table of Contents In the U.S. Credit Card Segment, we experienced a decrease in segment profit due to annualizing over a significant reserve reduction in the prior year and lower finance charge revenue resulting from a smaller portfolio. These changes were partially offset by lower interest expense due to repayment of $2,769 million in collateralized debt in the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as the additional week in 2012. The 2012 and 2011 loss in our Canadian Segment totaling $369 million and $122 million, respectively, is comprised of start-up costs and depreciation related to our 2013 entry into the Canadian retail market. Credit Card Receivables Transaction On October 22, 2012, we reached an agreement to sell our entire consumer credit card portfolio to TD Bank Group (TD). Historically, our credit card receivables were recorded at par value less an allowance for doubtful accounts. With this agreement, our receivables are classified as held for sale at February 2, 2013, and are recorded at the lower of cost (par) or fair value. We recorded a gain of $161 million outside of our segments in 2012, representing the net adjustment to eliminate our allowance for doubtful accounts and record our receivables at lower of cost (par) or fair value. On March 13, 2013, we completed the sale to TD for cash consideration of $5.7 billion, equal to the gross (par) value of the outstanding receivables at the time of closing. Concurrent with the sale of the portfolio for $5.7 billion, we repaid the nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables (2006/2007 Series Variable Funding Certificate) at par of $1.5 billion, resulting in net cash proceeds of $4.2 billion. As of March 20, 2013, we also have open tender offers to use up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion of cash proceeds from the sale to repurchase outstanding debt. Over time, we expect to apply the remaining proceeds from the sale in a manner that will preserve our strong investment-grade credit ratings by further reducing our debt position and continuing our current share repurchase program. Following this sale, TD will underwrite, fund and own Target Credit Card and Target Visa receivables in the U.S. TD will control risk management policies and oversee regulatory compliance, and we will perform account servicing and primary marketing functions. We will earn a substantial portion of the profits generated by the Target Credit Card and Target Visa portfolios. This transaction will be accounted for as a sale, and the receivables will no longer be reported on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. In the first quarter of 2013, we will recognize a gain on sale of $391 million related to consideration received in excess of the recorded amount of the receivables. Consideration received includes cash of $5.7 billion and a beneficial interest asset of $225 million. The beneficial interest effectively represents a receivable for the present value of future profit-sharing we expect to receive on the receivables sold. Based on historical payment patterns, we estimate that the beneficial interest asset will be reduced over a four year period, with larger reductions in the early years. As a result, a portion of the profit-sharing payments we receive from TD in the first four years of the arrangement will not be recorded as income on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Following the sale of our credit card portfolio in 2013, income from the profit-sharing arrangement, net of account servicing expenses, will be recognized within SG&A expenses. Including the profit-sharing arrangement in the U.S. Segment will reduce the SG&A rate below the historical U.S. Retail Segment SG&A rate, and raise EBITDA and EBIT margin rates above historical U.S. Retail Segment rates. For comparison purposes, historical U.S. Retail Segment and U.S. Credit Card Segment results will be restated to form a new U.S. Segment. The combination of these two historical segments into a single U.S. Segment will result in a higher SG&A rate in 2013 compared with 2012, 2011 and 2010, reflecting credit card profit that will be retained by TD beginning in 2013. Although we expect lower EBITDA and EBIT margin rates in the U.S. Segment compared with prior periods, we expect that the impact of the receivables sale transaction will become neutral and ultimately accretive to EPS over time. 15 Table of Contents Analysis of Results of Operations U.S. Retail Segment U.S. Retail Segment Results Percent Change (dollars in millions) 2012 (a) 2011 2010 2012/2011 2011/2010 Sales $ 71,960 $ 68,466 $ 65,786 5.1 % 4.1 % Cost of sales 50,568 47,860 45,725 5.7 4.7 Gross margin 21,392 20,606 20,061 3.8 2.7 SG&A expenses (b) 14,342 13,774 13,367 4.1 3.0 EBITDA 7,050 6,832 6,694 3.2 2.1 Depreciation and amortization 2,031 2,067 2,065 (1.8 ) 0.1 EBIT $ 5,019 $ 4,765 $ 4,629 5.3 % 2.9 % Note: See Note 29 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes. (a) Consisted of 53 weeks. (b) Effective with the October 2010 nationwide launch of our 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program, we changed the formula under which the U.S. Retail Segment charges the U.S. Credit Card Segment to better align with the attributes of this program. Loyalty program charges were $300 million, $258 million and $102 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In all periods, these amounts were recorded as reductions to SG&A expenses within the U.S. Retail Segment and increases to operations and marketing expenses within the U.S. Credit Card Segment. U.S. Retail Segment Rate Analysis 2012 (a) 2011 2010 Gross margin rate 29.7 % 30.1 % 30.5 % SG&A expense rate 19.9 20.1 20.3 EBITDA margin rate 9.8 10.0 10.2 Depreciation and amortization expense rate 2.8 3.0 3.1 EBIT margin rate 7.0 7.0 7.0 Rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales. (a) Consisted of 53 weeks. Sales Sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, and gift card breakage. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a definition of gift card breakage. Sales growth in 2012 and 2011 resulted from higher comparable-store sales and the contribution from new stores, with 2012 also benefitting by 1.7 percentage points from the additional week. Inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented. Refer to the Merchandise section in Item 1, Business, for additional product category information. Comparable-store sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores and digital sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. The method of calculating comparable-store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable-store sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Comparable-store sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than thirteen months. Comparable-Store Sales 2012 2011 2010 Comparable-store sales change 2.7 % 3.0% 2.1 % Drivers of change in comparable-store sales: Number of transactions 0.5 % 0.4% 2.0 % Average transaction amount 2.3 % 2.6% 0.1 % Selling price per unit 1.3 % 0.3% (2.3) % Units per transaction 1.0 % 2.3% 2.5 % 16 Table of Contents The collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive and consumer behavioral factors, as well as sales mix, and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible. Credit is offered to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards: the Target Credit Card and the Target Visa (Target Credit Cards). Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary Target Debit Card. Collectively, we refer to these products as REDcards . Since October 2010, guests receive a 5-percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout, every day, when they use a REDcard. In November 2011, guests also began to receive free shipping at Target.com when they use their REDcard. We monitor the percentage of store sales that are paid for using REDcards (REDcard Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of the incremental purchases on our REDcards are also incremental sales for Target, with the remainder representing a shift in tender type. REDcard Penetration 2012 2011 2010 Target Credit Cards 7.9 % 6.8 % 5.2 % Target Debit Card 5.7 2.5 0.7 % Total store REDcard Penetration 13.6 % 9.3 % 5.9 % Gross Margin Rate Our gross margin rate was 29.7 percent in 2012, 30.1 percent in 2011 and 30.5 percent in 2010. The decrease in each period reflects the impact of our integrated growth strategies of our 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program and our store remodel program, which impacted the rate by 0.4 percent and 0.5 percent in 2012 and 2011, respectively, partially offset by underlying rate improvements within categories in 2011. The REDcard Rewards loyalty program reduces gross margin rates because it drives incremental sales among guests who receive a 5-percent discount on virtually all items purchased. The remodel program reduces the overall gross margin rate because it drives incremental sales with a stronger-than-average mix in lower-than-average gross margin rate product categories, primarily food. We changed certain merchandise vendor contracts beginning in 2013. As a result, we expect our gross margin rate to increase by about 20 to 25 basis points from prior years, with an equal and offsetting increase in our SG&A rate. This shift will result from a larger proportion of vendor income offsetting cost of sales as compared to certain advertising expenses within SG&A. This change will have no impact on our EBITDA or EBIT margins or margin rates as our SG&A rate will increase by the same amount. In January 2013 we announced plans to price match top online retailers year-round. Based on our experience during the 2012 holiday season, we do not expect this change to significantly affect our gross margin rate. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate Our SG&A expense rate was 19.9 percent, 20.1 percent and 20.3 percent in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The change in 2012 was primarily due to improvements in store hourly payroll expense, which impacted the rate by 0.1 percent, and continued disciplined expense management across the Company, partially offset by technology and multichannel investments, which impacted the rate by nearly 0.2 percent. The change in 2011 was primarily due to increased loyalty program charges to the U.S. Credit Segment and favorable leverage on store hourly payroll expense. As noted above, a 2013 change to certain merchandise vendor contracts is expected to increase our SG&A rate by about 20 to 25 basis points because vendor funding will no longer offset certain advertising expenses. This change will have no impact on our EBITDA or EBIT margins or margin rates as our gross margin rate will increase by the same amount. Following the sale of our credit card portfolio in 2013, income from the profit-sharing arrangement, net of account servicing expenses, will be recognized as an offset to SG&A expenses. 17 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Expense Rate Our depreciation and amortization expense rate was 2.8 percent, 3.0 percent and 3.1 percent in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in 2012 was due to the favorable impact of higher sales combined with stable depreciation and amortization expenses, reflecting the moderate pace of capital investments in recent years, and the impact from the additional week in 2012.

U.S. Credit Card Segment Credit is offered to qualified guests through the Target Credit Cards, which support our core retail operations and are important contributors to our overall profitability and engagement with our guests. Credit card revenues are comprised of finance charges, late fees and other revenue, and third party merchant fees, which are amounts received from merchants who accept the Target Visa. 18 Table of Contents U.S Credit Card Segment Results 2012 (a) 2011 2010 (dollars in millions) Amount Rate (e) Amount Rate (e) Amount Rate (e) Finance charge revenue $ 1,089 17.8 % $ 1,131 17.9 % $ 1,302 18.3 % Late fees and other revenue 173 2.8 179 2.8 197 2.8 Third party merchant fees 79 1.3 89 1.4 105 1.5 Total revenue 1,341 22.0 1,399 22.1 1,604 22.6 Bad debt expense (b) 196 3.2 154 2.4 528 7.4 Operations and marketing expenses (b) 562 9.2 550 8.7 433 6.1 Depreciation and amortization 13 0.2 17 0.3 19 0.3 Total expenses 771 12.6 721 11.4 980 13.8 EBIT 570 9.3 678 10.7 624 8.8 Interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables 13 72 83 Segment profit $ 557 $ 606 $ 541 Average receivables funded by Target (c) $ 4,569 $ 2,514 $ 2,771 Segment pretax ROIC (d) 12.0 % 24.1 % 19.5 % Note: See Note 29 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes.

For 2012, fourth quarter bad debt expense was replaced by net write-offs in this calculation. See footnote (b) to our U.S. Retail Segment Results table for an explanation of our loyalty program charges. (c) Amounts represent the portion of average credit card receivables, at par, funded by Target. For 2012, 2011 and 2010, these amounts exclude $1,423 million, $3,801 million and $4,335 million, respectively, of receivables funded by nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables. (d) ROIC is return on invested capital. This rate equals our segment profit divided by average credit card receivables, at par, funded by Target, expressed as an annualized rate. (e) As a percentage of average credit card receivables, at par. For 2012, the additional week has been adjusted to provide comparable results to the prior period.

(a) Consisted of 53 weeks. (b) Balance-weighted one-month LIBOR. (c) Spread to LIBOR is a metric used to analyze the performance of our total credit card portfolio because the majority of our portfolio earned finance charge revenue at rates tied to the Prime Rate, and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR. (d) As a percentage of average credit card receivables, at par. For 2012, the additional week has been adjusted to provide comparable results to the prior period. Our primary measure of segment profit is the EBIT generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables. We also measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar Spread to LIBOR at the portfolio level. This metric approximates overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio by measuring the difference between EBIT earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost applied to the entire portfolio. The interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR. We 19 Table of Contents continue to recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense within our U.S. Credit Card Segment, which allows us to evaluate the performance of the portfolio. The allowance for doubtful accounts is eliminated in consolidation to present the receivables at the lower of cost (par) or fair value. On a consolidated basis, net write-offs are reported within credit card expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In 2012 and 2011, segment revenues decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower average receivables resulting in reduced finance charge revenue. In 2012, segment expense increases were driven by higher bad debt expense, primarily attributable to annualizing over a significant reserve reduction in the prior year. In 2011, segment expenses decreased from the prior year as we significantly reduced our bad debt reserve due to improved trends in key measures of risk. Segment interest expense on nonrecourse debt declined in both 2012 and 2011 due to lower outstanding nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables. Receivables Rollforward Analysis Percent Change (dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012/2011 2011/2010 Beginning credit card receivables, at par $ 6,357 $ 6,843 $ 7,982 (7.1 )% (14.3 )% Charges at Target 6,294 5,098 3,699 23.5 37.8 Charges at third parties 4,709 5,192 5,815 (9.3 ) (10.7 ) Payments (12,286 ) (11,653 ) (11,283 ) 5.4 3.3 Other 950 877 630 8.3 39.3 Period-end credit card receivables, at par $ 6,024 $ 6,357 $ 6,843 (5.2 )% (7.1 )% Average credit card receivables, at par $ 5,992 $ 6,314 $ 7,106 (5.1 )% (11.1 )% Accounts with three or more payments (60+ days) past due as a percentage of period-end credit card receivables, at par 2.7 % 3.3 % 4.2 % Accounts with four or more payments (90+ days) past due as a percentage of period-end credit card receivables, at par 1.9 % 2.3 % 3.1 % Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Percent Change (dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012/2011 2011/2010 Allowance at beginning of period $ 430 $ 690 $ 1,016 (37.7 )% (32.1 )% Bad debt expense 196 154 528 27.3 (70.8 ) Write-offs (a) (424 ) (572 ) (1,007 ) (25.8 ) (43.2 ) Recoveries (a) 133 158 153 (15.2 ) 3.0 Segment allowance at end of period $ 335 $ 430 $ 690 (22.0 )% (37.7 )% As a percentage of period-end credit card receivables, at par 5.6 % 6.8 % 10.1 % Net write-offs as an annualized percentage of average credit card receivables, at par 4.9 % 6.6 % 12.0 % (a) Write-offs include the principal amount of losses (excluding accrued and unpaid finance charges), and recoveries include current period principal collections on previously written-off balances. These amounts combined represent net write-offs. Period-end and average credit card receivables, at par, have declined because of an increase in payment rates and a decrease in Target Visa charges at third-parties, partially offset by an increase in charges at Target over the past two years. The decrease in charges at third parties is primarily due to the fact that we no longer issue new Target Visa accounts. Canadian Segment During 2012 and 2011, start-up costs reported in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations totaled $272 million and $74 million, respectively, and primarily consisted of compensation, benefits and third-party 20 Table of Contents service expenses. Additionally, we recorded $97 million and $48 million in depreciation for 2012 and 2011, respectively. Other Performance Factors Net Interest Expense Net interest expense was $762 million in 2012, including $78 million of interest on Canadian capitalized leases. This decrease of 12.0 percent, or $104 million, from 2011 was primarily due to an $87 million loss on early retirement of debt in 2011. As of March 20, 2013, we also have open tender offers to use up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion of cash proceeds from the sale to repurchase outstanding debt, which will impact interest expense in 2013. Net interest expense was $866 million for 2011, increasing 14.4 percent, or $109 million from 2010. This increase was due to an $87 million loss on early retirement of debt, $44 million of interest on Canadian capitalized leases and higher average debt balances, partially offset by a lower average portfolio interest rate. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate increased to 34.9 percent in 2012, from 34.3 percent in 2011, primarily due to a reduction in the favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the unfavorable impact of losses in Canada, which are tax effected at a lower rate than U.S. earnings. Various income tax matters were resolved in 2012 and 2011 which reduced tax expense by $58 million and $85 million, respectively. A tax rate reconciliation is provided in Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 34.3 percent in 2011, from 35.1 percent in 2010, primarily due to a reduction in the structural domestic effective tax rate. This reduction was slightly offset by a reduction in the favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the unfavorable impact of losses in Canada, which are tax effected at a lower rate than U.S. earnings. Various income tax matters were resolved in 2011 and 2010 which reduced tax expense by $85 million and $102 million, respectively. We expect a 2013 consolidated effective income tax rate of 35.7 percent to 36.7 percent, excluding the impact of resolution of income tax matters. 21 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures Our segment measure of profit is used by management to evaluate the return on our investment and to make operating decisions. To provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes the impact of our 2013 Canadian market entry, the gain on receivables held for sale, favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the loss on early retirement of debt. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our U.S. operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share. Non-GAAP adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP adjusted EPS differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

The 2012 results also include a $55 million tax expense for the adjustment related to receivables held for sale, while the 2011 results include a $32 million tax benefit related to the loss on early retirement of debt. (g) Represents the loss on early retirement of debt. 22 Table of Contents Analysis of Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our period-end cash and cash equivalents balance was $784 million compared with $794 million in 2011. Short-term investments (highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the time of purchase) of $130 million and $194 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place certain dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments. Cash Flows Our 2012 operations were funded by both internally and externally generated funds. Cash flow provided by operations was $5,325 million in 2012 compared with $5,434 million in 2011. During 2012, we issued $1.5 billion of unsecured debt that matures in July 2042, and we amended the 2006/2007 Series Variable Funding Certificate to obtain additional funding of $500 million and to extend the maturity to 2013. These cash flows, combined with our prior year-end cash position, allowed us to fund capital expenditures, pay current maturities, pay dividends and continue purchases under our share repurchase program. Our 2012 period-end credit card receivables, at par, were $6,024 million compared with $6,357 million in 2011, a decrease of 5.2 percent. Average credit card receivables, at par, in 2012 decreased 5.1 percent compared with 2011 levels. This change was driven by the factors indicated in the U.S. Credit Card Segment above. As of February 2, 2013, $1,500 million of our credit card receivables portfolio was funded by third parties. On October 22, 2012, we reached an agreement to sell our entire consumer credit card portfolio to TD Bank Group (TD). On March 13, 2013, we completed the sale to TD for cash consideration of $5.7 billion, equal to the gross (par) value of the outstanding receivables at the time of closing. Concurrent with the sale of the portfolio, we repaid the nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables (2006/2007 Series Variable Funding Certificate) at par of $1.5 billion, resulting in net cash proceeds of $4.2 billion. As of March 20, 2013, we also have open tender offers to use up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion of cash proceeds from the sale to repurchase outstanding debt. Over time, we expect to apply the remaining proceeds from the sale in a manner that will preserve our strong investment-grade credit ratings by further reducing our debt position and continuing our current share repurchase program. Year-end inventory levels decreased slightly from $7,918 million in 2011 to $7,903 million in 2012, primarily due to supply chain management improvements and continued disciplined inventory management, partially offset by an increase in inventory for our 2013 Canadian retail market entry. Accounts payable increased by $199 million, or 2.9 percent over the same period. Share Repurchases During the first quarter of 2012, we completed a $10 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2007, and began repurchasing shares under a new $5 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2012. During 2012, we repurchased 32.2 million shares of our common stock for a total investment of $1,900 million ($58.96 per share). During 2011, we repurchased 37.2 million shares of our common stock for a total investment of $1,894 million ($50.89 per share). Dividends We paid dividends totaling $869 million in 2012 and $750 million in 2011, for an increase of 15.9 percent. We declared dividends totaling $903 million ($1.38 per share) in 2012, for an increase of 16.2 percent over 2011. We declared dividends totaling $777 million ($1.15 per share) in 2011, an increase of 17.8 percent over 2010. We have 23 Table of Contents paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future. Short-term and Long-term Financing Our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility, and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt, commercial paper and securitized debt markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings. As of February 2, 2013, our credit ratings were as follows: Credit Ratings Standard and Poor's Moody's Fitch Long-term debt A2 A+ A- Commercial paper P-1 A-1 F2 If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same as described above. As a measure of our financial condition, we monitor our interest coverage ratio, representing the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense. Our interest coverage ratio was 6.1x in 2012, 5.9x in 2011 and 6.1x in 2010. In 2012, we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through internally generated funds. In 2011, we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and used the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued. Commercial Paper (dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Maximum daily amount outstanding during the year $ 970 $ 1,211 $ Average amount outstanding during the year 120 244 Amount outstanding at year-end 970 Weighted average interest rate 0.16 % 0.11 % % We have additional liquidity through a committed $2.25 billion revolving credit facility obtained in October 2011 and expiring in October 2017. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2012 or 2011 under this facility. Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. Our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants, and these covenants have no practical effect on our ability to pay dividends. Additionally, at February 2, 2013, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control; and (ii) our long-term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, pay dividends and continue purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future. We continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and long-term financing. 24 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures 2012 2011 Capital Expenditures (a) (millions) U.S. Canada Total U.S. Canada Total 2010 New stores $ 673 $ 417 $ 1,090 $ 439 $ 1,619 $ 2,058 $ 574 Store remodels and expansions 690 690 1,289 1,289 966 Information technology, distribution and other 982 515 1,497 748 273 1,021 589 Total $ 2,345 $ 932 $ 3,277 $ 2,476 $ 1,892 $ 4,368 $ 2,129 (a) See Note 29 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for capital expenditures by segment. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2012 from the prior year was primarily driven by the purchase of Zellers leases in Canada in 2011 and fewer store remodels in the U.S. in 2012, partially offset by continued investment in new stores in the U.S. and Canada and technology and multichannel investments. We expect approximately $3.8 billion of capital expenditures in 2013, reflecting an estimated $2.3 billion in our U.S. Segment and approximately $1.5 billion in our Canadian Segment.

See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (b) Total contractual lease payments include $3,323 million and $2,039 million of capital and operating lease payments, respectively, related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised. These payments also include $947 million and $181 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that are expected to open in 2013 or later for capital and operating leases, respectively. Capital lease obligations include interest. See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (c) Real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. (d) Deferred compensation obligations include commitments related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees, forecasted investment returns, and the projected timing of future retirements. 25 Table of Contents (e) Estimated tax contingencies of $280 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (f) Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. (g) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met. (h) We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of February 2, 2013. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: Other than the unrecorded contractual obligations above, we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions. However, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment: Inventory and cost of sales: We use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method, inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's ending retail value. The cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory, freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores, and import costs, reduced by vendor income and cash discounts. The majority of our distribution center operating costs, including compensation and benefits, are expensed in the period incurred. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change, including changing consumer demand, guest preferences, changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $7,903 million and $7,918 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively, and is further described in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 26 Table of Contents Vendor income receivable: Cost of sales and SG&A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors. This "vendor income" is earned for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising allowances, as well as for our compliance programs. We establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned. The majority of all year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $621 million and $592 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively, and is described further in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Credit card receivables accounting: Historically, our credit card receivables were recorded at par value less an allowance for doubtful accounts. When receivables were recorded, we recognized an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future write-offs. The allowance included provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit-related fees. We estimated future write-offs based on historical experience of delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends and industry risk trends. Accounts were automatically written off when they became 180 days past due. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts was appropriate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable; however, unexpected, significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could have materially changed these expectations. As of February 2, 2013, our consumer credit card receivables are recorded at the lower of cost (par) or fair value because they are classified as held for sale as a result of the credit card receivables transaction. Lower of cost (par) or fair value is determined on a segmented basis using the delinquency and credit-quality segmentation we have historically used to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts. Many nondelinquent balances are recorded at cost (par) because fair value exceeds cost. Delinquent balances are generally recorded at fair value, which reflects our expectation of losses on these receivables. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our credit card receivables. Long-lived assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. A 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell or close as of February 2, 2013 would result in additional impairment of $4 million in 2012. Historically, we have not realized material losses upon sale of long-lived assets. Insurance/self-insurance: We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $627 million and $646 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self-insurance expense by $31 million in 2012. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Item 7A for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. 27 Table of Contents Income taxes: We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities, and record any changes in the financial statements as deemed appropriate. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $280 million and $318 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension and postretirement health care accounting: We maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan, as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire and/or length of service. The benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate and compensation growth rates. The assumptions used to determine the period-end benefit obligation also establish the expense for the next year, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.0 percent is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance and current market conditions. Our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans' assets was 5.7 percent, 10.0 percent, 7.8 percent and 9.5 percent for the 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 20-year periods, respectively. A one percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $27 million. The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $28 million. Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members. Pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 28 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal contingencies: We are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. We believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. We do not believe that any of the currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there may be a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. New Accounting Pronouncements We do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements. 28 Table of Contents Forward-Looking Statements This report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations.
