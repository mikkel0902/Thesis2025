Overview We are a medical device company with an innovative approach to the design, development and commercialization of products for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. Our goal is to lead in insulin therapy management by building a robust ecosystem and portfolio of data-driven products and services around our flagship insulin pumps. We believe our competitive advantage is rooted in our consumer-focused approach, and the incorporation of modern and innovative technology into our product offerings. Our manufacturing, sales and support activities principally focus on our flagship pump platform, the t:slim X2 Insulin Delivery System (t:slim X2), and our complementary product offerings. The simple-to-use t:slim X2 is based on our proprietary technology platform and is the smallest durable insulin pump available. It is the only pump currently available in the United States that is capable of remote feature updates, which positions us well to address the evolving needs and preferences of differentiated segments of the insulin-dependent diabetes market. We aim to improve and simplify the lives of people with diabetes and those of their healthcare providers, by delivering innovative hardware and software solutions, as well as best-in-class customer support. Since our initial commercial launch, we have been able to rapidly innovate and bring more products to market than our competitors. We have commercially launched seven insulin pumps in the United States since 2012 and two pumps outside the United States since 2018. Four of our insulin pumps have featured integration with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology, and two have featured an automated insulin delivery (AID) algorithm. We believe that the three new classifications defined by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the interoperability of devices for AID will help support continued rapid innovation by streamlining the regulatory pathway for integrated products. In June 2018, the t:slim X2 was the first insulin pump designated as compatible with integrated continuous glucose monitoring (known as iCGM) devices; in February 2019, the t:slim X2 was the first in a new device category called Alternate Controller Enabled Infusion Pumps (ACE pumps); and in December 2019, Control-IQ technology for the t:slim X2 insulin pump was the first automated insulin dosing software in a new interoperable automated glycemic controller category. In the four-year period ended December 31, 2019 , we shipped approximately 142,000 insulin pumps, which is representative of our estimated global installed customer base on the typical four-year reimbursement cycle. Approximately 118,000 of these pumps were shipped to customers in the United States, and approximately 24,000 were shipped to international markets. Today, our t:slim X2 hardware platform represents 100% of our new pump shipments. It is the only commercial insulin pump that allows users to update their pumps software quickly and easily from a personal computer. We have offered in-warranty t:slim customers in the United States four different software updates for no-cost using the Tandem Device Updater, including our two AID algorithms, Basal-IQ technology and Control-IQ technology. Basal-IQ technology launched in August 2018 and is a predictive low glucose suspend feature that is designed to temporarily suspend insulin delivery to help reduce the frequency and duration of hypoglycemic events. Control-IQ technology launched in January 2020 and is an advanced hybrid-closed loop feature, designed to help increase a user's time in targeted glycemic range. It is the first and only system cleared to deliver automatic correction boluses in addition to adjusting insulin to help prevent high and low blood sugar. Outside the United States we began selling efforts with t:slim X2 with Dexcom G5 integration in the third quarter of 2018, offering no-cost software updates for Basal-IQ technology in the third quarter of 2019, and intend to begin offering Control-IQ technology updates in select geographies in the second half of 2020. 52 Our insulin pump products are generally considered durable medical equipment and have an expected lifespan of at least four years. In addition to insulin pumps, we sell disposable products that are used together with our pumps and are replaced every few days, including cartridges for storing and delivering insulin, and infusion sets that connect the insulin pump to a user body. Our insulin pumps are compatible with the Tandem Device Updater, a revolutionary tool that allows pump users to update their pumps software quickly and easily from a personal computer. This unique offering positions us to bring future innovations, including our next generation AID algorithms, to our in-warranty t:slim X2 customers independent of the typical four-year insurance pump reimbursement cycle, faster than the industry has been able to in the past. The Tandem Device Updater launched in the United States in the first quarter of 2017 and outside of the United States in the third quarter of 2019. Since its launch, we have offered in-warranty t:slim customers in the United States four different software updates for no-cost using the Tandem Device Updater, including Basal-IQ technology and, most recently, Control-IQ technology. Outside the United States we began offering no-cost software updates for Basal-IQ technology in the third quarter of 2019 and intend to begin offering Control-IQ technology updates in the second half of 2020, subject to required regulatory and reimbursement approvals. For the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , our consolidated sales were $362.3 million, $183.9 million, and $107.6 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , our net loss was $24.8 million, $122.6 million, and $73.0 million, respectively. Worldwide pump sales accounted for 68% , 67% , and 66% of our total sales, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , while pump-related supplies and accessories accounted for the remainder in each year. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $624.8 million and $ 600.1 million, respectively. These amounts included $216.6 million and $147.4 million of non-cash stock-based compensation charges and non-cash changes in the fair value of common stock warrants as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. In the United States, we have rapidly increased sales since the commercial launch of our first product by expanding our sales, clinical and marketing organization, by developing, commercializing and marketing multiple differentiated products that utilize our proprietary technology platform and consumer-focused approach, and by providing strong customer support. Our sales have further increased following our scaled product launches in geographies outside of the United States. We believe that by demonstrating our product benefits and the shortcomings of existing insulin therapies, more people will choose our insulin pumps for their therapy needs, allowing us to further penetrate and expand the market worldwide. In addition, we believe publications, such as the results from the study using Control-IQ technology that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in October 2019, will be valuable in demonstrating the clinical outcome benefits derived from our system to healthcare providers and payors. We also believe we are positioned well to address consumers needs and preferences with our current products and products under development and by offering customers access to our future innovations through the Tandem Device Updater, as they are approved by the local regulating bodies. At the same time, by innovating and offering new product features and benefits using our t:slim X2 platform, we are able to leverage a shared global manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure. In the United States, we are able to leverage a single sales, marketing, and clinical organization, as well as our domestic customer support services. In Canada, we have a separate sales organization and our customer support infrastructure benefits from close collaboration with our United States organization. In other international geographies, we have contracted with experienced distribution partners to commercialize and support our t:slim X2 platform. Products Under Development Our products under development support our strategy of focusing on both consumer and clinical needs, and include AID system enhancements, a connected (mobile) health offerings and a next-generation hardware platform which we call the t:sport Insulin Delivery System (t:sport). We intend to leverage our consumer-focused approach and proprietary technology platform to continue to develop products that have the features and functionality that will allow us to meet the needs of people in differentiated segments of the insulin-dependent diabetes market, including the following: t:sport Insulin Delivery System Approximately half the size of our t:slim X2 pump, the t:sport pump is being designed for people who seek even greater discretion and flexibility with the use of their insulin pump. We anticipate that t:sport will feature a 200-unit cartridge, an on-pump bolus button, a rechargeable battery, an AID algorithm, and a Bluetooth radio. t:sport is being designed for use with leading U-100 insulins, and we are evaluating the use of insulin concentrates to provide to people with greater insulin needs. We anticipate that t:sport will be our first insulin pump to support full pump-control from our mobile application, subject to FDA review and approval. A separate controller may be offered in addition to or in advance of full mobile control availability. 53 Connected (Mobile) Health Offerings We are currently preparing for the launch of a mobile application that has been designed to utilize the capability of the Bluetooth radio integrated with the t:slim X2 to wirelessly upload pump data to t:connect, receive notification of pump alerts and alarms, and provide a discrete, secondary display of glucose and insulin data. Future updates of this app will integrate other health-related information from third party sources, and support future pump-control capabilities for our products under development. The launch of the first generation of this mobile application in the United States follows the roll-out of our Control-IQ technology and, by allowing for the wireless upload of data to t:connect, is intended to reduce patient burden and increase healthcare provider office efficiency by reducing the manual steps historically required for data extraction. Over time, we also intend to offer additional features and enhancements to the mobile application, including partial or full control of pump features. For additional information, see the section of this Annual Report under the caption Business in Part I, Item 1. Pump Shipments From inception through June 2018, we derived nearly all of our sales from the shipment of insulin pumps and associated supplies to customers in the United States. Starting in the third quarter of 2018, we commenced sales of our t:slim X2 insulin pump in select international geographies. We consider the number of insulin pump units shipped per quarter to be an important metric for managing our business. In the four-year period ended December 31, 2019 , we shipped approximately 142,000 insulin pumps, of which approximately 118,000 were shipped to customers in the United States, and approximately 24,000 were shipped to international markets. In the year ended December 31, 2019 , we shipped 73,431 insulin pumps worldwide, compared to 34,493 insulin pumps shipped in 2018 . Pump shipments to customers in the United States by fiscal quarter were as follows: Pump Units Shipped for Each of the Three Months Ended in Respective Years - U.S. March 31 June 30 September 30 December 31 Total 2012 9 204 844 1,057 2013 852 1,363 1,851 2,406 6,472 2014 1,723 2,235 2,935 3,929 10,822 2015 2,487 3,331 3,431 6,234 15,483 2016 4,042 4,582 3,896 4,418 16,938 2017 2,816 3,427 3,868 6,950 17,061 2018 4,444 5,447 7,379 12,935 30,205 2019 9,669 12,799 13,814 17,453 53,735 Pump shipments to international customers by fiscal quarter were as follows: Pump Units Shipped for Each of the Three Months Ended in Respective Years - International March 31 June 30 September 30 December 31 Total 2018 N/A N/A 1,055 3,233 4,288 2019 5,063 8,459 4,025 2,149 19,696 54 Technology Upgrade Program Beginning in the third quarter of 2016 through the third quarter of 2017, we offered a Technology Upgrade Program under a variable pricing structure, as a pathway for certain existing customers to obtain the t:slim X2. The accounting treatment for the program required us to defer up to 100% of sales at the time of pump shipment and recognize them in a subsequent period, either when the upgrade was fulfilled or at the expiration of the program. We recognized the deferred amount of sales and cost of sales at the earlier of when the obligations under the program were satisfied or upon the expiration of the program. If a customer elected to participate in the program, we recognized any upgrade fees that we received and the associated costs at the time of fulfilling the given obligation. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded incremental net sales of $5.0 million with a corresponding increase of $3.1 million in gross profit as a result of the Technology Upgrade Program. The program expired on September 30, 2017 and, therefore, had no impact on our 2018 and 2019 financial results. Trends Impacting Financial Results Overall, we have experienced considerable sales growth since the commercial launch of our first product in the third quarter of 2012, while incurring operating losses since our inception. Our operating results have historically fluctuated on a quarterly or annual basis, particularly in periods surrounding anticipated regulatory approvals, the commercial launch of new products by us and our competitors, and the commercial launch of our products in geographies outside of the United States. We expect these periodic fluctuations in our operating results to continue. We believe that our financial condition and operating results, as well as the decision-making process of our current and potential customers, has been and will continue to be impacted by a number of general trends, including the following: market acceptance of our products and competitive products by people with insulin-dependent diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers; the introduction of new products, treatment techniques or technologies for the treatment of diabetes, including the timing of the commercialization of new products by us and our competitors; seasonality in the United States associated with annual insurance deductibles and coinsurance requirements associated with the medical insurance plans utilized by our customers and the customers of our distributors; timing of holidays and summer vacations, which may vary by geography; the buying patterns of our distributors and other customers, both domestically and internationally; changes in the competitive landscape, including as a result of companies entering or exiting the diabetes therapy market; access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for our current and future products by third-party payors, and reimbursement decisions by third-party payors; the magnitude and timing of any changes to our facilities, manufacturing operations and other infrastructure; anticipated and actual regulatory approvals of our products and competitive products; and product recalls impacting, or the suspension or withdrawal of regulatory clearance or approval relating to, our products or the products of our competitors. In addition to these general trends, we believe the following specific factors have materially impacted, and could continue to materially impact our business going forward: continued increase in demand following the commercial launch of t:slim X2 and the demonstrated success of our Tandem Device Updater; anticipated new product launches; increased opportunity to achieve customer renewals as customers become eligible for insurance reimbursement to purchase a new insulin pump at the end of the typical four-year reimbursement cycle; benefit in 2018 and 2019 following the announcement by Johnson & Johnson that it discontinued the operations of Animas Corporation (Animas) and discontinued availability of Animas pump supplies in September 2019; 55 designation by UnitedHealthcare of one of our competitors as its preferred, in-network durable medical equipment provider of insulin pumps for most customers age seven and above; ability to enter into and maintain agreements with CGM partners for CGM integration; expansion and new product launches in select international geographies; accounting variability and complexity associated with certain commercial programs, such as the Technology Upgrade Program offered in 2016 and 2017 that provided a pathway for in-warranty customers to our next-generation hardware platform; and ability to effectively scale our operations to support rapid growth, including expanding our facilities, advancing our research and development efforts, increasing manufacturing capacity through third-party manufacturers, and hiring and retaining employees in customer service and support functions. In addition to working to achieve our sales growth expectations, we intend to continue to leverage our infrastructure investments to realize additional manufacturing, sales, marketing and administration cost efficiencies with the goal of improving our operating margins and ultimately achieving sustained profitability. We achieved profitability for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2018, and again in the fourth quarter of 2019, though we may be unable to achieve profitability consistently from period to period. We believe we can ultimately achieve sustained profitability by driving incremental sales growth in U.S. and international markets, meeting our pump renewal sales objectives, maximizing manufacturing efficiencies on increased production volumes, and leveraging the investments made in our sales, clinical, marketing and customer support organizations. Recent Developments In December 2019, the FDA cleared our t:slim X2 insulin pump with Control-IQ technology, an advanced hybrid-closed-loop feature designed to help increase time in range, and the first and only system cleared to deliver automatic correction boluses in addition to adjusting insulin delivery to help prevent high and low blood sugar. The system integrates with Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), which requires no fingersticks for calibration or diabetes treatment decisions. Components of Results of Operations Sales We offer products for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. We commenced commercial sales of our original t:slim insulin pump platform in the United States in the third quarter of 2012 and continued to launch various iterations of that platform during the following years. In October 2016, we began shipping our flagship pump platform, the t:slim X2 insulin pump. The t:slim X2 hardware platform, which includes remote software update capabilities, now represents 100% of our new pump shipments. Accordingly, in the third quarter of 2018 we discontinued new sales of all prior platform versions. Our products also include disposable cartridges and infusion sets. In addition, we offer accessories including protective cases, belt clips, and power adapters, although sales of these products are not significant. We primarily sell our products through national and regional distributors in the United States on a non-exclusive basis. These distributors are generally providers of medical equipment and supplies to individuals with diabetes. Our primary end customers are people with insulin-dependent diabetes. Similar to other durable medical equipment, the primary payor is generally a third-party insurance carrier and the customer is usually responsible for any medical insurance plan copay or coinsurance requirements. We believe our existing sales, clinical, and marketing infrastructure will allow us to continue to increase sales by allowing us to promote our products to a greater number of potential customers, caregivers and healthcare providers. 56 In the third quarter of 2018, we began the launch of our t:slim X2 with G5 through distribution partners outside the United States, including in select European countries, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. During the second quarter of 2019, we began selling our t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology in certain of these geographies. Our independent distributor partners perform all sales, customer support and training in their respective markets. In Canada, we market with a direct sales force and, similar to the United States, use a distributor partner for certain billing and fulfillment activities. Historically, we have experienced consistent levels of reimbursement for our products in the United States, but we expect the average sales price will vary in international markets based on a number of factors, such as the geographical mix, nature of the reimbursement environment, government regulations and the extent to which we rely on distributor relationships to provide sales, clinical and marketing support. In general, in the United States we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, pump shipments being weighted heavily towards the second half of the year, with the highest percentage of pump shipments expected in the fourth quarter due to the nature of the reimbursement environment. Consistent with our historical seasonality, we also expect domestic pump shipments from the fourth quarter to the following first quarter to decrease significantly. Internationally, we do not expect this same impact from seasonality associated with reimbursement, although the quarterly sales trends may be impacted by summer vacations and launches into new geographies. While the opportunity to transition former Animas customers during 2019 positively impacted our quarterly sales trends worldwide, we do not anticipate future significant benefit. In addition, our quarterly sales have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, substantially in the periods surrounding anticipated and actual regulatory approvals and commercial launches of new products by us or our competitors. We believe customers may defer purchasing decisions if they believe a new product may be launched in the future. Additionally, upon the announcement of FDA approval or commercial launch of a new product, either by us or one of our competitors, potential new customers may reconsider their purchasing decisions or take additional time to consider the anticipated or new approval or product launch in making their purchasing decisions. For instance, we believe certain customers paused in their decision-making during the second half of 2019 in anticipation of the commercial availability of the t:slim X2 with Control-IQ technology. However, it is difficult to quantify the extent of the impact of these or similar events on future purchasing decisions. Cost of Sales Historically, we have manufactured our pumps and disposable cartridges at our manufacturing facility in San Diego, California. In 2020, we anticipate outsourcing a portion of our cartridge manufacturing to an experienced third-party contract manufacturer. Infusion sets and pump accessories are manufactured by third-party suppliers. Cost of sales includes raw materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead expenses, product training costs, freight, reserves for expected warranty costs, scrap and excess and obsolete inventories. Manufacturing overhead expenses include expenses relating to quality assurance, manufacturing engineering, material procurement, inventory control, facilities, equipment, information technology and operations supervision and management. We anticipate that our cost of sales will continue to increase as our product sales increase. Over the long term, we expect our overall gross margin percentage, which for any given period is calculated as sales less cost of sales divided by sales, to improve, as our sales increase and our overhead costs are spread over larger production volumes. We expect we will be able to leverage our manufacturing cost structure across our products that utilize the same technology platform and manufacturing infrastructure and will be able to further reduce per unit costs with increased automation, process improvements and raw materials cost reductions. Pumps have, and are expected to continue to have, a higher gross margin than our pump-related supplies. Therefore, the percentage of pump sales relative to total sales will have a significant impact on gross margin. We also expect our warranty cost per unit to decrease as we release additional product features and functionality utilizing the Tandem Device Updater. However, our overall gross margin may fluctuate in future quarterly periods as a result of numerous factors aside from those associated with production volumes and product mix. In addition, as demand for our products increases, we have begun, and may continue, to make additional investments in manufacturing capacity or increase our reliance on third parties for manufacturing-related services, either of which could have a negative impact on gross margin in the near-term. Specifically, in 2020, we plan to invest in additional manufacturing equipment to meet anticipated long-term demand for our cartridges, which may initially place downward pressure on the gross margin on our supplies. Other factors impacting our overall gross margin may include the changing percentage of products sold to distributors versus directly to individual customers, varying levels of reimbursement among third-party payors in domestic and international markets, the timing and success of new regulatory approvals and product launches, the impact of the valuation and amortization of employee stock option grants on non-cash stock-based compensation expense allocated to cost of sales, changes in warranty estimates, training costs, licensing and royalty costs, cost associated with excess and obsolete inventories, and changes in our manufacturing processes, capacity, costs or output. 57 Selling, General and Administrative Our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses primarily consist of salary, cash-based incentive compensation, fringe benefits and non-cash stock-based compensation for our executive, financial, legal, marketing, sales, clinical, customer support, technical services, insurance verification, regulatory affairs and other administrative functions. We began expanding our U.S. field sales and clinical organization during the third quarter of 2019 to support an expected increase in demand. We expect to have approximately 90 territories by early 2020. Our existing territories are maintained by sales representatives and field clinical specialists, and supported by managed care liaisons, additional sales management and other customer support personnel. Our operations in Canada are supported by a direct sales force of approximately 17 field representatives. Other significant SG&A expenses include those incurred for product demonstration samples, commercialization activities associated with new product launches, travel, trade shows, outside legal fees, independent auditor fees, outside consultant fees, insurance premiums, facilities costs and information technology costs. Overall, we expect our SG&A expenses, including the cost of our customer support infrastructure, to increase as our customer base grows in the United States and international markets. We will continue to evaluate, and may further increase, the number of our field sales and clinical personnel in order to optimize the coverage of our existing territories. Additionally, we realized a notable increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense allocated to SG&A beginning in the third quarter of 2018, and again in the second quarter of 2019, due to the valuation of certain employee stock option grants and the impact on the valuation of the significant increase in our stock price over the previous year. We expect higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense will be sustained through the first half of 2020 and will begin to decline in future quarters. Our SG&A expenses may also increase due to anticipated costs associated with additional compliance and regulatory reporting requirements. Research and Development Our research and development (R&D), activities primarily consist of engineering and research programs associated with our products under development, as well as activities associated with our core technologies and processes. R&D expenses are primarily related to employee compensation, including salary, fringe benefits, non-cash stock-based compensation and temporary employee expenses. We also incur R&D expenses for supplies, development prototypes, outside design and testing services, depreciation, allocated facilities and information services, clinical trial costs, payments under our licensing, development and commercialization agreements and other indirect costs. We expect our R&D expenses to increase as we advance our products under development and develop new products and technologies, partially offset by future expected declines in non-cash stock-based compensation. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense primarily consists of changes in the fair value of certain warrants issued in our public offering of common stock in October 2017, and interest earned on our cash equivalents and short-term investments. In 2018 and 2017, it also included interest expense and amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs associated with our Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement (Term Loan Agreement) with Capital Royalty Partners II, L.P. and its affiliated funds (CRG), and a $5.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the full repayment of amounts due under the Term Loan Agreement in August 2018. Prior to the repayment, there was $ 82.7 million of outstanding principal under the Term Loan Agreement, which accrued interest at a rate of 11.5% per annum. As a result of the full repayment, we did not incur any interest expense or costs associated with the Term Loan Agreement subsequent to the third quarter of 2018. Other income also includes interest earned on our cash equivalents and short-term investments. We expect other income and expense to fluctuate from period to period primarily due to the revaluation of certain outstanding common stock warrants, which expire in the fourth quarter of 2022. 58 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, (in thousands, except percentages) 2019 2018 2017 Sales: Domestic $ 302,084 $ 174,188 $ 107,601 International 60,221 9,678 Total sales 362,305 183,866 107,601 Cost of sales 168,093 94,044 63,507 Gross profit 194,212 89,822 44,094 Gross margin 54 % 49 % 41 % Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 165,735 105,226 86,377 Research and development 45,199 29,227 20,661 Total operating expenses 210,934 134,453 107,038 Operating loss (16,722 ) (44,631 ) (62,944 ) Other income (expense), net: Interest and other income 3,271 1,462 239 Interest and other expense (78 ) (7,584 ) (11,341 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt (5,313 ) Change in fair value of stock warrants (11,075 ) (66,494 ) 1,021 Total other expense, net (7,882 ) (77,929 ) (10,081 ) Loss before income taxes $ (24,604 ) $ (122,560 ) $ (73,025 ) Income tax expense 149 51 8 Net loss $ (24,753 ) $ (122,611 ) $ (73,033 ) Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 Sales . For the year ended December 31, 2019 , sales were $362.3 million, which included $60.2 million of international sales. For the year ended December 31, 2018 , sales were $183.9 million, which included $9.7 million of international sales which commenced in the third quarter of 2018. The increase in total sales of $178.4 million in 2019 , as compared to 2018 , was primarily driven by a 113% increase in worldwide pump shipments to 73,431 in 2019 , compared to 34,493 in 2018 . Worldwide pump shipments were positively impacted by strong demand for our products following the August 2018 domestic launch of t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology and the commencement of commercial sales of t:slim X2 with G5 integration in select international geographies beginning in the third quarter of 2018, as well as the fulfillment of international pump demand from backlog that existed at the end of 2018 due to supply constraints. In addition, worldwide sales in 2019 and 2018 were positively impacted by the transition of former Animas customers to our products. However, we do not anticipate significant benefit from conversion of Animas customers beyond 2019. Sales from pump-related supplies increased 91% primarily due to an overall increase in our installed base of customers reordering supplies. The ratio of the number of infusion sets shipped to the number of cartridges shipped was over 100% in both of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Domestic sales by product were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Pump $ 205,492 $ 115,719 Infusion sets 66,034 40,260 Cartridges 30,022 17,796 Other 536 413 Total Domestic Sales $ 302,084 $ 174,188 59 International sales by product were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Pump $ 42,094 $ 8,205 Infusion sets 11,221 629 Cartridges 6,656 781 Other 250 63 Total International Sales $ 60,221 $ 9,678 Sales to distributors accounted for 73% and 78% of our total domestic sales for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Our percentage of sales to distributors versus individual customers is principally determined by the mix of customers ordering our products within the period and whether or not we have a contractual arrangement with their underlying third-party insurance payor. Sales to distributors accounted for 92% and 100% of our total international sales for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Cost of Sales and Gross Profit . Our cost of sales in 2019 was $168.1 million, resulting in gross profit of $194.2 million, compared to $94.0 million of cost of sales in 2018 resulting in gross profit of $89.8 million. The gross margin for 2019 was 54% , compared to 49% in 2018 . The improvement in both gross profit and gross margin was primarily the result of the increase in insulin pump sales which have a higher gross margin than pump-related supplies. Gross margin and gross profit also increased as a result of per-unit manufacturing cost improvements from higher production volumes and continued overall manufacturing efficiencies gained from our new manufacturing facility which became fully operational at the beginning of 2018. On an aggregate basis, other non-manufacturing costs, which primarily consist of warranty, freight and training costs, also reflected improvement on a per unit basis. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense allocated to cost of sales increased to $6.4 million in 2019 compared to $2.6 million in 2018, due primarily to the valuation of certain 2018 and 2019 employee stock option grants and the impact on the valuation of the significant increase in our stock price. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increase d 58% to $165.7 million in 2019 from $105.2 million in 2018 . Employee-related expenses for our SG&A functions comprise the majority of the SG&A expenses. These expenses increase d $49.6 million during 2019 compared to 2018 , which included an increase of $23.6 million in salaries, incentive compensation and other employee benefits due to an increase in personnel to support our growing installed customer base, and a $26.0 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense allocated to SG&A increased to $42.9 million in 2019, compared to $16.8 million in 2018, due primarily to the valuation of certain 2018 and 2019 employee stock options grants and the impact on the valuation of the significant increase in our stock price. We also experienced increased costs for equipment and supplies, outside consulting and services, and travel of $10.9 million. Research and Development Expenses . R&D expenses increased 55% to $45.2 million in 2019 from $29.2 million in 2018 . The increase in R&D expenses was primarily the result of an increase of $4.8 million in salaries, incentive compensation and other employee benefits due to an increase in personnel to support our product development efforts, and a $4.5 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense allocated to R&D increased to $8.8 million in 2019, compared to $4.3 million in 2018, due primarily to the valuation of certain 2018 and 2019 employee stock option grants and the impact on the valuation of the significant increase in our stock price. We also experienced increased costs for outside consulting and services, clinical trials, and supplies of $5.8 million. Other Income (Expense) . Total other expense in 2019 was $7.9 million, compared to $77.9 million in 2018 . Other expense in 2019 primarily consisted of a $11.1 million revaluation loss from the change in fair value of certain warrants due to the significant appreciation in our stock price during 2019, offset by interest and other income of $3.3 million . Other expense in 2018 consisted primarily of a $66.5 million revaluation loss from the change in fair value of certain warrants due to the significant appreciation in our stock price during 2018, $7.6 million of interest expense associated with the Term Loan Agreement, as well as a $5.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the full repayment of our Term Loan Agreement in August 2018. Interest and other income primarily consisted of interest earned on our cash equivalents and short-term investments, for which our average invested balances were significantly higher in 2019 as compared to 2018 . 60 Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 Sales . For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales were $183.9 million, which included $9.7 million of international sales which commenced in the third quarter of 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales were $107.6 million, which included incremental net pump sales of $5.0 million as a result of the Technology Upgrade Program in place at that time. The increase in total sales of $76.3 million in 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily driven by a 102% increase in worldwide pump shipments to 34,493 in 2018, compared to 17,061 in 2017. Worldwide pump shipments were positively impacted by strong demand for our products following the August 2018 domestic launch of t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ technology, the August 2017 launch of t:slim X2 with G5 integration, and the commencement of commercial sales in select international geographies beginning in the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, sales from pump-related supplies increased 66% primarily due to the September 2017 launch of infusion set products using the t:lock connector, as well as an overall increase in our installed customer base of customers reordering supplies. The ratio of the number of infusion sets shipped to the number of cartridges shipped increased to over 100% in 2018 from 69% in the year ended 2017. Domestic sales by product were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Pump $ 115,719 $ 71,518 Infusion sets 40,260 21,444 Cartridges 17,796 14,173 Other 413 466 Total Domestic Sales $ 174,188 $ 107,601 International sales by product were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 (1) Pump $ 8,205 $ Infusion sets 629 Cartridges 781 Other 63 Total International Sales $ 9,678 $ (1) International sales commenced in the third quarter of 2018. We did not have any international sales during the year ended December 31, 2017. Sales to distributors accounted for 78% and 75% of our total domestic sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our percentage of sales to distributors versus individual customers is principally determined by the mix of customers ordering our products within the period and whether or not we have a contractual arrangement with their underlying third-party insurance payor. The percentage was particularly impacted in 2018 by the mid-2017 launch of the t:lock connector, which resulted in greater purchases of infusion sets by our independent distributors during the period as compared to the same period during the prior year. Sales to distributors accounted for 100% of our total international sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cost of Sales and Gross Profit . Our cost of sales in 2018 was $94.0 million, resulting in gross profit of $89.8 million, compared to $63.5 million of cost of sales and gross profit of $44.1 million in 2017, which included incremental gross profit of $3.1 million associated with the Technology Upgrade Program. The gross margin for 2018 was 49%, compared to 41% in 2017. The incremental gross profit associated with the Technology Upgrade Program benefited our 2017 gross margin by one percentage point. 61 The improvement in both gross profit and gross margin was primarily the result of the increase in insulin pump sales which have a higher gross margin than pump-related supplies, as well as per-unit cost improvements on all products from increased production volumes and manufacturing efficiencies. On an aggregate basis, other non-manufacturing costs, which primarily consist of warranty, freight and training costs, also reflected improvement on a per unit basis. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense allocated to cost of sales increased to $2.6 million in 2018, compared to $1.4 million in 2017, due primarily to the valuation of certain 2018 employee stock option grants and the impact on the valuation of the significant increase in our stock price during 2018. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A expenses increased 22% to $105.2 million in 2018 from $86.4 million in 2017. Employee-related expenses for our SG&A functions comprise the majority of the SG&A expenses. These expenses increased $18.4 million during 2018 compared to 2017, which included an increase of $11.6 million in salaries, incentive compensation and other employee benefits due in part to an increase in personnel to support our growing installed customer base, as well as the impact of our strong year-over-year sales growth on incentive-based compensation. Additionally, there was a $6.8 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense allocated to SG&A increased to $16.8 million in 2018, compared to $10.0 million in 2017, due primarily to the valuation of certain 2018 employee stock option grants and the impact on the valuation of the significant increase in our stock price during 2018. Research and Development Expenses . R&D expenses increased 41% to $29.2 million in 2018 from $20.7 million in 2017. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily the result of an increase of $4.1 million in salaries, incentive compensation and other employee benefits due to an increase in personnel to support our product development efforts, and a $3.1 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense due to the significant increase in our stock price in 2018. In addition, our strong year-over-year sales growth drove a substantial year-over-year increase in incentive-based compensation. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense allocated to R&D increased to $4.3 million in 2018, compared to $1.2 million in 2017, due primarily to the valuation of certain 2018 employee stock option grants and the impact on the valuation of the significant increase in our stock price during 2018. Other Income (Expense) . Total other expense in 2018 was $77.9 million, compared to $10.1 million in 2017. Other expense in 2018 primarily consisted of a $66.5 million revaluation loss from the change in fair value of certain warrants due to the significant appreciation in our stock price during 2018, $7.6 million of interest expense associated with the Term Loan Agreement, as well as a $5.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the full repayment of our Term Loan Agreement in August 2018. Other expense in 2017 consisted primarily of interest expense associated with the Term Loan Agreement. The outstanding principal balance under the Term Loan Agreement was $82.7 million prior to the repayment and as of December 31, 2017. Interest and other income primarily consisted of interest earned on our cash equivalents and short-term investments, for which our average invested balances were significantly higher in 2018 as compared to 2017. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2019 , we had $176.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this filing. Historically, our principal sources of cash have included private placements and public offerings of equity securities, debt financing, and cash collected from product sales. Since the beginning of 2018, we completed the following financings: In February 2018, we completed a registered public offering of 34,500,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $2.00 per share. The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $69.0 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. In August 2018, we completed a registered public offering of 4,035,085 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $28.50 per share. The gross proceeds from the offering were $115.0 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. From January 2018 through December 2019, we received proceeds of $29.9 million from the exercise of 8,829,235 outstanding warrants which were originally issued in a registered public offering of common stock in October 2017. As of December 31, 2019 , there were warrants to purchase 417,315 shares outstanding relating to the October 2017 offering. 62 From January 2018 through December 2019, we issued 1,554,995 shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options, and 409,653 shares of common stock were purchased under our 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which generated aggregate proceeds of $26.3 million. Our historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with cash used for operating activities such as the development and commercialization of our products, the expansion and support of our sales, marketing, clinical and customer support organizations, the expansion of our R&D activities, the expansion of our commercial activities to select international geographies, the acquisition of intellectual property, expenditures related to increases in our manufacturing capacity and improvements to our manufacturing efficiency, overall expansion of our facilities and operations, and other working capital needs. Additionally, we have used cash to pay the interest expense associated with our Term Loan Agreement. The outstanding balance associated with the Term Loan Agreement was fully repaid in August 2018, and we have ceased incurring interest expense and other costs associated with the Term Loan Agreement subsequent to the third quarter of 2018. We expect our sales performance and the resulting operating income or loss, as well as the status of each of our new product development programs, will significantly impact our cash flow from operations, liquidity position and cash management decisions. The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2019 2018 2017 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 41,906 $ (8,319 ) $ (66,136 ) Investing activities (56,955 ) (90,739 ) 2,782 Financing activities 24,207 117,184 40,376 Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash 191 Total $ 9,349 $ 18,126 $ (22,978 ) Operating activities . Net cash provided by operating activities was $ 41.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 , compared to net cash used of $ 8.3 million and $ 66.1 million for the same periods in 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The improvement to net cash provided by operating activities for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by higher sales and gross margins in 2019, which resulted in a significant reduction in net loss when adjusted for non-cash expenses, particularly stock-based compensation expense and the change in the fair value of common stock warrants, offset by net changes in working capital. Our operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included $7.6 million in interest expense, and a $5.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt. Working capital changes in 2019 primarily consisted of increases in accounts receivable and inventories, offset by increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses, employee-related liabilities, deferred revenue, and other long-term liabilities related to warranty reserves for 2019 pump sales. Accounts receivable increased to $46.6 million at December 31, 2019 from $35.2 million at December 31, 2018, as a result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Inventories increased to $49.1 million at December 31, 2019 from $19.9 million at December 31, 2018, primarily to support the growth in our business. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily associated with a reduction in the net loss when adjusted for non-cash expenses, particularly the change in the fair value of certain common stock warrants, increased stock-based compensation expense, and a $5.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt in 2018, as well as net changes in working capital. Our operating loss also included $7.6 million and $11.3 million in interest expense during 2018 and 2017, respectively. Working capital changes were due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher sales, offset by a reduction in inventories and increases in employee related liabilities and deferred revenue. Inventories decreased to $19.9 million at December 31, 2018 from $27.0 at December 31, 2017 due to an increase in sales demand during the fourth quarter of 2018, and the timing of pump production and certain inventory receipts. 63 Investing activities . Net cash used by investing activities was $ 57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 , which was primarily related to purchases of short-term investments of $164.6 million and $19.5 million in purchases of property and equipment, offset by $127.2 million in proceeds from maturities and sales of short-term investments. Net cash used by investing activities was $ 90.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 , which was primarily related to purchases of short-term investments of $123.6 million using the net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in August of 2018, and $3.0 million in purchases of property and equipment, offset by $35.8 million in proceeds from maturities of short-term investments. Net cash provided by investing activities was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was primarily related to proceeds from maturities of short-term investments of $8.5 million offset by $5.7 million in purchases of property and equipment. Financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $ 24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 , which was primarily the result of proceeds of $23.9 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans. Net cash provided by financing activities was $ 117.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 , which was primarily the result of net proceeds of approximately $172.9 million from the public offerings of our common stock in February 2018 and August 2018, as well as proceeds of $29.6 million from the exercise of common stock warrants that were issued in the public offering of common stock in October 2017, offset by the $87.7 million repayment of our term loan and associated financing fees. Net cash provided by financing activities was $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was primarily the result of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Our liquidity position and capital requirements are subject to fluctuation based on a number of factors. In particular, our cash inflows and outflows are principally impacted by the following: our ability to generate sales, the timing of those sales, the mix of products sold and the collection of receivables from period to period; the timing of any additional financings, and the net proceeds raised from such financings; the timing and amount of the exercise of outstanding warrants, and proceeds from the issuance of equity awards pursuant to employee stock plans; fluctuations in gross margins and operating margins; and fluctuations in working capital, including changes in accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, employee related liabilities, and operating lease liabilities. Our primary short-term capital needs are expected to include expenditures related to: support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products; expansion of our customer support resources for our growing installed customer base; research and product development efforts, including clinical trial costs; acquisitions of equipment, technology, intellectual property and other assets; additional facilities leases and related tenant improvements, and manufacturing equipment to support business growth and increase manufacturing capacity; and payments under licensing, development and commercialization agreements. 64 Although we believe the foregoing items reflect our most likely uses of cash in the short-term, we cannot predict with certainty all of our particular cash uses or the timing or amount of cash used. In addition, from time to time we may consider opportunities to acquire or license other products or technologies that may enhance our product platform or technology, expand the breadth of our markets or customer base, or advance our business strategies. Any such transaction may require short-term expenditures that may impact our capital needs. If for any reason our cash and cash equivalents balances, or cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, we may in the future be required to seek additional capital from public or private offerings of our equity or debt securities, or we may elect to borrow capital under new credit arrangements or from other sources. We may also seek to raise additional capital from such offerings or borrowings on an opportunistic basis when we believe there are suitable opportunities for doing so. If we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, we may incur significant financing or debt service costs, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. There can be no assurance that financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Our ability to raise additional financing may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including our recent and projected financial results, recent changes in and volatility of our stock price, perceptions about the dilutive impact of financing transactions, the competitive environment in our industry, and uncertainties regarding the regulatory environment in which we operate. Indebtedness Repayment of Term Loan Agreement In August 2018, we fully repaid our term loan with CRG pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement. The balance of the outstanding debt at the time of repayment was $82.7 million. The total repayment amount of $88.8 million included approximately $1.1 million in accrued interest, and approximately $5.0 million in associated financing fees that became due. Therefore, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. At the time of repayment, the remaining $5.3 million debt discount balance associated with the financing fees and certain debt issuance costs was accelerated and recognized as a loss on extinguishment of debt during the third quarter of 2018. Contractual Obligations & Commitments The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal period for our outstanding contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 : Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Operating lease obligations (1)(2) $ 31,464 $ 7,010 $ 15,209 $ 5,269 $ 3,975 Firm purchase commitments (3) 128,215 112,173 16,042 Total contractual obligations $ 159,679 $ 119,183 $ 31,251 $ 5,269 $ 3,975 (1) Operating lease obligations of $23.1 million were included in operating lease liabilities current and long-term in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019 (see Note 5, "Leases"). The additional $8.3 million included in the above table consists of $8.2 million due under the lease of additional general office space located on Shoreline Drive, Boise, Idaho (Shoreline Lease), which we entered into in November of 2019, and $0.1 million related to short-term leases. Minimum annual lease payments under the Shoreline Lease will be approximately $0.5 million in 2020, $1.1 million in 2021 and 2022, $1.2 million in 2023 and 2024, and $3.1 million thereafter. The Company currently estimates that it will recognize the Shoreline Lease operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet upon the lease commencement in the first quarter of 2020. (2) Does not include $2.5 million due under the lease of additional general office space located on High Bluff Drive, San Diego, California, which we entered into in January of 2020. Minimum annual lease payments under the lease will be approximately $1.0 million in 2020, $1.2 million in 2021, and $0.3 million in 2022. (3) Includes purchase orders that are cancellable under the standard terms of our purchase order agreements. In certain cases, cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments may require payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation. 65 Critical Accounting Policies Involving Management Estimates and Assumptions Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about our financial condition and results of operations that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Our revenue is generated primarily from sales of our insulin pumps, disposable cartridges and infusion sets to individual customers and third-party distributors that resell the product to insulin-dependent diabetes customers. We are paid directly by customers who use the products, distributors and third-party insurance payors. We recognize revenue when control of our products is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive from our customers in exchange for those products. This process involves identifying the contract with a customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied. Revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the separate satisfaction of each distinct performance obligation within the contract. A performance obligation is considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and is separately identified in the contract. We consider a performance obligation satisfied once we have transferred control of a product to the customer, meaning the customer has the ability to use and obtain the benefit of the product. Complementary products, such as the t:connect cloud-based data management application and the Tandem Device Updater, are considered performance obligations satisfied over time, as access and support for these products is provided throughout the typical four-year warranty period of the insulin pumps. Accordingly, revenue related to the complementary products is deferred and recognized ratably over a four-year period. There is no standalone value for these complementary products. Therefore, we determine their value by applying the expected cost plus a margin approach and then allocate the residual to the insulin pumps. Warranty Reserve We generally provide a four- year warranty on our insulin pumps to end user customers and may replace any pumps that do not function in accordance with the product specifications. Insulin pumps returned to us may be refurbished and redeployed. Additionally, we offer a six-month warranty on disposable cartridges and infusion sets. Estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of shipment. We evaluate the reserve quarterly. Warranty costs are primarily estimated based on the current expected product replacement cost and expected replacement rates utilizing historical experience. Recently released versions of our pump may not incur warranty costs in a manner similar to previously released pumps, on which we initially base our warranty estimate of newer pumps. We may make further adjustments to the warranty reserve when deemed appropriate, giving additional consideration to length of time the pump version has been in the field and future expectations of performance based on new features and capabilities that may become available through Tandem Device Updater . Changes to the actual replacement rates or the expected product replacement cost could have a material impact on our estimated warranty reserve . 66 Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved. The evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, and includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence. Factors reviewed include projections of pre-tax book income for the foreseeable future, determination of cumulative pre-tax book income after permanent differences, earnings history, and reliability of forecasting. We will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist. Any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the statement of operations for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required. Utilization of our net operating loss and research credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards before utilization. We have completed an analysis through December 31, 2018 to determine whether our net operating losses and credits are likely to be limited by Section 382. Based on this study, we determined that an ownership change, as defined under Section 382, occurred in 2018 and the resulting limitation significantly reduced our ability to utilize our net operating loss and credit carryovers before they expire. As a result, in 2019 we reduced our deferred tax assets for the net operating loss and research credit carryforwards that are projected to expire unused with a corresponding offset to the valuation allowance recorded against such assets. Additionally, future ownership changes under Section 382 may also limit our ability to fully utilize any remaining tax benefits. The Company income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of the Company tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential revisions and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2019 , we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
