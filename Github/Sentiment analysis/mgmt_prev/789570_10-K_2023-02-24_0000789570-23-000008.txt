ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes discussion as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. Discussion of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on February 25, 2022. Description of our business and key performance indicators Our primary business is the operation of casino resorts, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. We operate several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. Most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to pay rent, fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, repay debt financings, and return capital to our shareholders. We lease the real estate assets of our domestic resorts pursuant to triple-net lease agreements and make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities. We also offer online gaming and sports betting through LeoVegas, our consolidated subsidiary, as well as through BetMGM, our unconsolidated affiliate. Our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access to capital and our cost of capital. While we continue to be focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity and returning capital to shareholders, we are also dedicated to capitalizing on strategic development or initiatives. Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major conventions, Far East baccarat volumes, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year and Lunar New Year. While our results do not depend on key individual customers, a significant portion of our operating income is generated from high-end gaming customers, which can cause variability in our results. In addition, our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or high-end gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results. Our results will also depend upon our ability to expand our ownership, management and operation of gaming facilities and accessing new markets for iGaming and online sports betting. Impact of COVID-19 The spread of COVID-19 and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in 2020, 2021 and 2022 and may continue to impact our business thereafter. In March 2020, all of our domestic properties were temporarily closed pursuant to state and local government restrictions imposed as a result of COVID-19. Throughout the second and third quarters of 2020, all of our properties that were temporarily closed re-opened to the public, with temporary re-closures and re-openings occurring for certain of our properties or portions thereof into the first quarter of 2021. Upon re-opening, the properties continued to operate without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations, with restrictions varying by jurisdiction. Beginning in the latter part of the first quarter of 2021 and continuing into the second quarter of 2021, our domestic jurisdictions eased and removed prior operating restrictions, including capacity and occupancy limits, as well as social distancing policies. As of December 31, 2022, all of our domestic properties were open and not subject to operating restrictions; however, travel and business volume were negatively affected in the early part of the first quarter of 2022 due to the spread of the omicron variant. In Macau, following a temporary closure of our properties on February 5, 2020, operations resumed on February 20, 2020, subject to certain health safeguards, such as limiting the number of seats available at each table game, slot machine spacing, reduced operating hours at a number of restaurants and bars, temperature checks, and mask protection. The issuance of tourist visas (including the individual visit scheme) for residents of Zhuhai, Guangdong Province and all other provinces in mainland China to travel to Macau resumed on August 12, 2020, August 26, 2020 and September 23, 2020, respectively, however several travel and entry restrictions in Macau, Hong Kong and mainland China remained in place (including the temporary suspension of ferry services between Hong Kong and Macau, the negative nucleic acid test result 32 certificate, and mandatory quarantine requirements for returning residents, for visitors from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and certain regions in mainland China, and bans on entry on other visitors), which significantly impacted visitation to our Macau properties. In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, local COVID-19 cases were identified in Macau. Upon such occurrences, a state of immediate prevention was declared and mass mandatory nucleic acid testing was imposed in Macau, the validity period of negative test results for re-entry into mainland China was shortened and quarantine requirements were imposed, certain events were cancelled or suspended, and in some instances, certain entertainment and leisure facilities were closed throughout Macau. Gaming operations were temporarily suspended on July 11, 2022 due to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Macau and resumed on July 23, 2022, subject to certain continuing health safeguards, with most restaurants and bars and certain retail outlets remaining closed. On October 30, 2022, a COVID-19 case was identified as connected to MGM Cotai. All guests and staff at MGM Cotai were isolated until November 1, 2022 and all gaming, hotel, restaurant, and retail operations were suspended with limited operations resumed beginning November 3, 2022. More broadly, electronic applications for individual and group travel visas to Macau resumed on November 1, 2022, however, certain travel and entry restrictions in Macau and mainland China remained in place at the time, including COVID-19 testing and certain quarantine requirements, which significantly impacted visitation to our Macau properties. Beginning in December 2022, Macau and mainland China started to unwind testing and quarantine requirements as well as travel and entry restrictions associated with the dynamic zero COVID-19 policy. On January 8, 2023, Macau lifted the majority of its COVID-19 pandemic travel and quarantine restrictions with the exception of overseas visitors travelling from outside of mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan being required to present a negative nucleic acid test or rapid antigen test result in place until February 6, 2023 when all remaining COVID-19 travel restrictions were removed. Visitation Statistics The Las Vegas Strip segment results of operations are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Las Vegas visitor volume increased 21% compared to the prior year period according to information published by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. The Las Vegas market has had the expansion of convention center, sporting, music, and entertainment events in the current year, which have significantly impacted visitation positively among business and leisure travel. The MGM China segment results of operations also are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Macau visitor arrivals decreased 26% compared to the prior year period according to statistics published by the Statistics and Census Service of the Macau Government, as the current year period was more negatively affected by travel and entry restrictions in Macau than in the prior year period. For a discussion of the risks to our business resulting from COVID-19, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business, Industry, and Market Conditions. Other Developments In February 2020, we completed the MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay transaction pursuant to which the real estate assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay (including Mandalay Place) were contributed to VICI BREIT Venture, owned 50.1% by MGP OP (now owned by VICI) and 49.9% by a subsidiary of BREIT. In exchange for the contribution of the real estate assets, MGM and MGP received total consideration of $4.6 billion, which was comprised of $2.5 billion of cash, $1.3 billion of MGP OP secured indebtedness assumed by VICI BREIT Venture, and MGP OP 50.1% equity interest in VICI BREIT Venture (now owned by VICI). In addition, MGP OP issued approximately 3 million MGP OP units to us representing 5% of the equity value of VICI BREIT Venture. We also provide a shortfall guarantee of the principal amount of indebtedness of VICI BREIT Venture (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon). On the closing date, BREIT also purchased approximately 5 million MGP Class A shares for $150 million. See Note 1, Note 11, and Note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this transaction, lease agreement, and shortfall guarantee, respectively. In connection with the MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay transaction, the master lease with MGP was modified to remove the Mandalay Bay property and VICI BREIT Venture entered into a lease with us for the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas. See Note 11 for information regarding the MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay lease. Also, in January 2020, we, MGP OP, and MGP entered into an agreement for MGP OP to waive its right following the closing of the MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay transaction to issue MGP Class A shares, in lieu of cash, to us in connection with us exercising our right to require MGP OP to redeem the MGP OP units we hold, at a price per unit 33 equal to a 3% discount to the ten day average closing price prior to the date of the notice of redemption . The waiver was effective upon closing of the transaction on February 14, 2020 and was scheduled to terminate on the earlier of February 14, 2022 or upon our receipt of cash proceeds of $1.4 billion as consideration for the redemption of our MGP OP units. On May 18, 2020 MGP OP redeemed approximately 30 million MGP OP units that we held for $700 million, or $23.10 per unit, and on December 2, 2020, MGP OP redeemed approximately 24 million of the MGP OP units that we held for the remaining $700 million, or $29.78 per unit. As a result, the waiver terminated in accordance with its terms. In March 2021, we delivered a notice of redemption to MGP covering approximately 37 million MGP OP units that they held which was satisfied with aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion, using cash on hand together with the proceeds from MGP issuance of Class A shares. See Note 13 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this transaction, which eliminates in consolidation. In September 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest in CityCenter for cash consideration of $2.125 billion. Upon the closing of the transaction, we own 100% of CityCenter and accordingly no longer account for our interest under the equity method of accounting, and we now consolidate CityCenter in our financial statements. See Note 4 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this transaction. In September 2021, we sold the real estate assets of Aria and Vdara for cash consideration of $3.89 billion and entered into a lease pursuant to which we lease back the real property. See Note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this lease. In October 2021, MGP acquired the real estate assets of MGM Springfield from us and MGM Springfield was added to the master lease with MGP. Transactions with MGP, including transactions under the master lease with MGP, have been eliminated in our consolidation of MGP. In April 2022, we completed the VICI Transaction in a stock-for-stock transaction. In connection with the transaction, VICI OP redeemed the majority of our VICI OP units for cash consideration of $4.4 billion, with us retaining an approximate 1% ownership interest in VICI OP. MGP Class B share that was previously held by us was cancelled. Accordingly, we no longer hold a controlling interest in MGP and deconsolidated MGP upon the closing of the transactions. In connection with the VICI Transaction, we entered into an amended and restated master lease with VICI. See Note 4 and Note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the transaction and lease, respectively. In May 2022, we acquired the operations of The Cosmopolitan for cash consideration of $1.625 billion, plus working capital adjustments for a total purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion. Additionally, we entered into a lease agreement for the real estate assets of the The Cosmopolitan. See Note 4 and Note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the transaction and lease, respectively. In June 2022, the Macau government enacted a new gaming law that provides for material changes to the legal form of gaming concessions in Macau, including discontinuing and prohibiting gaming subconcessions subsequent to their expiration, and also includes material changes to the rights and obligations provided for under the new gaming concessions that were awarded in the public tender that concluded in December 2022, such as limiting the term of concessions to a maximum of 10 years. As a result, we reassessed the useful life of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession intangible asset and reduced the useful life to align with the contractual term of the subconcession, which expired on December 31, 2022, thereby accelerating the recognition of amortization within our statements of operations. See Note 1 and Note 7 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion. In December 2022, we were awarded a new gaming concession, which permits the operation of games of chance or other games in casinos in Macau, commencing on January 1, 2023. In September 2022, we acquired LeoVegas through a tender offer at a cash price of SEK 61 per share, for a total fair value of equity interests acquired of approximately $556 million, inclusive of cash settlement of equity awards. See Note 4 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of this transaction. In December 2022, we completed the sale of the operations of The Mirage to Hard Rock for cash consideration of $1.075 billion, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. At closing, the master lease with VICI was amended to remove The Mirage and reflect a $90 million reduction in annual cash rent. Refer to Note 4 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of this transaction. 34 In February 2023, we completed the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica to CNE for cash consideration of $450 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. At closing, the master lease with VICI was amended to remove Gold Strike Tunica and reflect a $40 million reduction in annual cash rent. Refer to Note 4 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction. Key Performance Indicators Key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue are: Gaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); win or hold percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. Our normal table games hold percentage at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts is in the range of 25.0% to 35.0% of table games drop for Baccarat and 19.0% to 23.0% for non-Baccarat; however, reduced gaming volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could cause volatility in our hold percentages; and Hotel revenue indicators (for Las Vegas Strip Resorts): hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate ( ADR, a price indicator); and revenue per available room ( REVPAR, a summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on standalone selling price. Because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites. Rooms that were out of service during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 as a result of property closures due to the pandemic were excluded from the available room count when calculating hotel occupancy and REVPAR. Additional key performance indicators at MGM China are: Gaming revenue indicators: MGM China utilizes turnover, which is the sum of nonnegotiable chip wagers won by MGM China calculated as nonnegotiable chips purchased plus nonnegotiable chips exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned. Turnover provides a basis for measuring VIP casino win percentage. Win for VIP gaming operations at MGM China is typically in the range of 2.6% to 3.3% of turnover; however, reduced gaming volumes as a result of the pandemic could cause volatility in MGM China hold percentages. Results of Operations Summary Operating Results The following table summarizes our operating results: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In thousands) Net revenues $ 13,127,485 $ 9,680,140 $ 5,162,082 Operating income (loss) 1,439,372 2,278,699 (642,434) Net income (loss) 206,731 1,208,389 (1,319,907) Net income (loss) attributable to MGM Resorts International 1,473,093 1,254,370 (1,032,724) Certain of our properties or portions thereof were temporarily closed due to COVID-19 during the comparative period in 2021 as follows: Park MGM and Mandalay Bay's hotel tower operations were closed midweek and full week hotel operations resumed March 3, 2021. The Mirage's hotel tower operations were closed midweek, with the entire property closed midweek starting January 4, 2021, and re-opened on March 3, 2021. MGM Springfield's hotel was closed and partial hotel operations resumed with midweek closures on March 5, 2021. Full hotel operations resumed on December 13, 2021. MGM Grand Detroit's hotel tower operations were closed and resumed on February 9, 2021. 35 Consolidated net revenues were $13.1 billion in 2022 compared to $9.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 36%. The current year benefited from the inclusion of the net revenues of The Cosmopolitan and a full year of net revenues related to Aria, partially offset by the disposition of The Mirage. The current year was initially negatively affected by a decrease in business volume and travel due to the spread of the omicron variant in the early part of the year; however, business volumes subsequently improved at our domestic resorts with a significant increase primarily at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts over the prior year, which was negatively affected by midweek property and hotel closures, lower travel activity, and operational restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At MGM China, the current and prior years were significantly impacted by travel and entry restrictions in Macau with the current year being negatively affected by property closures and more significantly impacted by restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the prior year. As a result, net revenues at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts increased 77%, Regional Operations increased 12%, and MGM China decreased 44% compared to the prior year. Consolidated operating income was $1.4 billion in 2022 compared to $2.3 billion in 2021, a decrease of 37%. The current year period benefited from an increase in gains from transactions and the increase in domestic business volumes discussed above, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expense, an increase in depreciation and amortization expense, and a decrease in income from unconsolidated affiliates. Gains from transactions in the current year included a $2.3 billion net gain related to the VICI Transaction recorded in gain on REIT transactions, net, and a $1.1 billion net gain related to the sale of the operations of The Mirage recorded within property transactions, net, while the prior year benefited from the $1.6 billion net gain on consolidation of CityCenter. General and administrative expense increased $1.7 billion primarily due to an increase of rent expense of $1.1 billion related to the Aria and Vdara, VICI, and The Cosmopolitan leases, which commenced in September 2021, April 2022, and May 2022, respectively, as well as other increases, primarily in payroll costs. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.3 billion compared to the prior year period, due primarily to an increase of $2.5 billion in amortization expense of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming concession as a result of the change in its useful life.

Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In thousands) Las Vegas Strip Resorts net revenues $ 8,398,372 $ 4,737,185 $ 2,245,785 Acquisitions (1) (2,226,495) (366,879) Dispositions (2) (559,858) (419,063) (172,720) Las Vegas Strip Resorts same-store net revenues $ 5,612,019 $ 3,951,243 $ 2,073,065 Las Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted Property EBITDAR $ 3,142,308 $ 1,738,211 $ 232,188 Acquisitions (1) (908,841) (159,930) Dispositions (2) (159,267) (122,127) 18,354 Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR $ 2,074,200 $ 1,456,154 $ 250,542 (1) Excludes the net revenues and Adjusted Property EBITDAR of The Cosmopolitan and Aria (2) Excludes the net revenues and Adjusted Property EBITDAR of The Mirage 39 Operating Results Details of Certain Charges Property transactions, net consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In thousands) Gain on sale of the operations of The Mirage $ (1,066,784) $ $ Other property transactions, net 29,787 (67,736) 93,567 $ (1,036,997) $ (67,736) $ 93,567 See Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of property transactions, net. Income (loss) from Unconsolidated Affiliates The following table summarizes information related to our share of operating income (loss) from unconsolidated affiliates: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In thousands) CityCenter (through September 26, 2021) $ $ 128,127 $ (29,753) VICI BREIT Venture (through April 29, 2022) 51,051 155,817 136,755 BetMGM (234,464) (211,182) (61,663) Other 23,200 12,061 (2,401) $ (160,213) $ 84,823 $ 42,938 In June 2021, CityCenter closed the sale of its Harmon land, for which we recorded a $50 million gain within our share of operating income from unconsolidated affiliates. In September 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest in CityCenter and now own 100% of the equity interest in CityCenter. Accordingly, we no longer account for our interest in CityCenter under the equity method of accounting, and we now consolidate CityCenter in our financial statements. In April 2022, we completed the VICI Transaction pursuant to which the assets and liabilities of MGP were derecognized, which included MGP OP investment in the VICI BREIT Venture. Non-operating Results Interest expense The following table summarizes information related to interest expense, net: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In thousands) Total interest incurred $ 595,692 $ 800,156 $ 679,251 Interest capitalized (738) (563) (2,871) $ 594,954 $ 799,593 $ 676,380 Gross interest expense was $596 million in 2022 compared to $800 million in 2021. The decrease from the prior year period is due primarily to a decrease in debt outstanding as a result of the derecognition of MGP OP senior notes in connection with the deconsolidation of MGP, partially offset by an increase in the debt outstanding under MGM China revolving credit facilities. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion on long-term debt and see Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussion on issuances and repayments of long-term debt and other sources and uses of cash. 40 Other, net Other income, net was $83 million in 2022 compared to $66 million in 2021. The current and prior year included interest income of $87 million and $22 million, respectively, and a net gain on equity investments of $10 million and $28 million, respectively. The current year income was partially offset by a $12 million loss relating to interest rate swaps, while the prior year included a $39 million gain on interest rate swaps. Income taxes The following table summarizes information related to our income taxes: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In thousands) Income (loss) before income taxes $ 903,799 $ 1,461,804 $ (1,511,479) Benefit (provision) for income taxes (697,068) (253,415) 191,572 Effective income tax rate 77.1 % 17.3 % 12.7 % Federal, state and foreign income taxes paid, net of refunds $ 22,955 $ 43,018 $ 8,543 Our effective rate for 2022 was unfavorably impacted by losses in Macau that we could not benefit and an increase in state deferred tax liabilities as a result of the New Jersey income tax regulation issuance, partially offset by a decrease in Macau deferred tax liabilities resulting from the acceleration of amortization of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession and the extension of the exemption from the Macau 12% complementary tax to the end of the year as well as the impact of a decrease in state deferred tax liabilities as a result of the VICI Transaction. Our effective rate for 2021 was favorably impacted by the permanent exclusion of a portion of the gain on consolidation of CityCenter, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of losses in Macau that we could not benefit. Cash taxes paid decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to refunds received from carryback claims related to losses incurred in 2020. Reportable Segment GAAP measure Adjusted Property EBITDAR is our reportable segment GAAP measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments and underlying operating segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, gain on REIT transactions, net, restructuring costs (which represents costs related to severance, accelerated stock compensation expense, and consulting fees directly related to the operating model component of the MGM 2020 Plan), rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures, and also excludes gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net, gain related to CityCenter sale of Harmon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates, corporate expense (which includes CEO transition expense and October 1 litigation settlement) and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each operating segment, and rent expense related to the master lease with MGP that eliminated in consolidation. We manage capital allocation, tax planning, stock compensation, and financing decisions at the corporate level. Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin is Adjusted Property EBITDAR divided by related segment net revenues. Non-GAAP Measures Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is Adjusted Property EBITDAR further adjusted to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of acquired operating segments from the date of acquisition through the end of the reporting period and to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of disposed operating segments from the beginning of the reporting period through the date of disposition. Accordingly, we have excluded the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of The Cosmopolitan for periods subsequent to its acquisition on May 17, 2022, Aria for periods subsequent to its acquisition on September 27, 2021, and The Mirage for the periods prior to its disposition on December 19, 2022 in Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR for the periods indicated, as applicable. Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a non-GAAP measure and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because management believes this measure is useful in providing meaningful 41 period-to-period comparisons of the results of our operations for operating segments that were consolidated for the full period presented to assist users of the financial statements in reviewing operating performance over time. Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, considered in isolation, or as an alternative to our reportable segment GAAP measure or net income, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR may not be defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies, and such differences may be material. A reconciliation of our reportable segment Adjusted Property EBITDAR GAAP measure to Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is included herein. Adjusted EBITDAR is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, gain on REIT transactions, net, gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net, CEO transition expense, October 1 litigation settlement, restructuring costs (which represents costs related to severance, accelerated stock compensation expense, and consulting fees directly related to the operating model component of the MGM 2020 Plan), rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, gain related to CityCenter sale of Harmon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates, and income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures. Adjusted EBITDAR information is a non-GAAP measure that is a valuation metric, should not be used as an operating metric, and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because we believe this measure is widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies. We believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAR may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends. Also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. In addition, management excludes rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases. Management believes excluding rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases provides useful information to analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors when valuing us, as well as comparing our results to other gaming companies, without regard to differences in capital structure and leasing arrangements since the operations of other gaming companies may or may not include triple-net operating leases or ground leases. However, as discussed herein, Adjusted EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, an indicator of our performance, considered in isolation, or construed as an alternative to operating income or net income, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis and excludes certain expenses, including the rent expense related to our triple-net operating leases and ground leases, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBITDAR may calculate Adjusted EBITDAR in a different manner and such differences may be material. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes, triple-net lease and ground lease payments, and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDAR. A reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDAR is included herein. 42 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to MGM Resorts International to Adjusted EBITDAR: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In thousands) Net income (loss) attributable to MGM Resorts International $ 1,473,093 $ 1,254,370 $ (1,032,724) Plus: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (1,266,362) (45,981) (287,183) Net income (loss) 206,731 1,208,389 (1,319,907) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 697,068 253,415 (191,572) Income (loss) before income taxes 903,799 1,461,804 (1,511,479) Non-operating (income) expense Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized 594,954 799,593 676,380 Non-operating items from unconsolidated affiliates 23,457 83,243 103,304 Other, net (82,838) (65,941) 89,361 535,573 816,895 869,045 Operating income (loss) 1,439,372 2,278,699 (642,434) Preopening and start-up expenses 1,876 5,094 84 Property transactions, net (1,036,997) (67,736) 93,567 Depreciation and amortization 3,482,050 1,150,610 1,210,556 Gain on REIT transactions, net (2,277,747) (1,491,945) Gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net (1,562,329) CEO transition expense 44,401 October 1 litigation settlement 49,000 Restructuring 26,025 Triple-net operating lease and ground lease rent expense 1,950,566 833,158 710,683 Gain related to sale of Harmon land - unconsolidated affiliate (49,755) Income from unconsolidated affiliates related to real estate ventures (61,866) (166,658) (148,434) Adjusted EBITDAR $ 3,497,254 Guarantor Financial Information As of December 31, 2022, all of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of our wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our senior credit facility. Our principal debt arrangements are not guaranteed by MGM Grand Detroit, MGM National Harbor, Blue Tarp reDevelopment, LLC (the entity that operates MGM Springfield), and each of their respective subsidiaries. Our foreign subsidiaries, including LeoVegas, MGM China, and each of their respective subsidiaries, are also not guarantors of our principal debt arrangements. In the event that any subsidiary is no longer a guarantor of our credit facility or any of our future capital markets indebtedness, that subsidiary will be released and relieved of its obligations to guarantee our existing senior notes. The indentures governing the senior notes further provide that in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of, or capital stock in a subsidiary guarantor then such subsidiary guarantor will be released and relieved of any obligations under its subsidiary guarantee. The guarantees provided by the subsidiary guarantors rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated debt of ours or such subsidiary guarantors, junior to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt and effectively subordinated to any indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes. In addition, the obligations of each subsidiary guarantor under its guarantee is limited so as not to constitute a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, which may eliminate the subsidiary guarantor obligations or reduce such obligations to an amount that effectively makes the subsidiary guarantee lack value. The summarized financial information of us and our guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis, is presented below. Prior to the VICI Transaction, certain of our guarantor subsidiaries accounted for the master lease with MGP as an operating lease with the rent expense reflected within the summarized financial information. Additionally, assets held for 43 sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale associated with Gold Strike Tunica are included within current assets and other current liabilities, respectively, within the summarized financial information. December 31, 2022 Balance Sheet (In thousands) Current assets $ 6,733,048 Other long-term assets 28,802,794 Other current liabilities 3,892,694 Other long-term liabilities 28,285,295 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Income Statement (In thousands) Net revenues $ 10,477,542 MGP master lease rent expense 429,065 Operating income 4,981,058 Income from continuing operations 2,589,135 Net income 1,668,214 Net income attributable to MGM Resorts International 1,668,214 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows Summary Our cash flows consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 1,756,462 $ 1,373,423 $ (1,493,043) Net cash provided by investing activities 2,118,181 1,543,645 2,159,304 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (3,024,302) (2,814,095) 2,103,427 Cash Flows Operating activities. Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, and tax payments or refunds . Cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion in 2022 compared to $1.4 billion in 2021. The change from the prior year was due primarily to the increase in Adjusted Property EBITDAR at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations discussed within the Results of Operations section above and a decrease in cash paid for interest, partially offset by an increase in triple-net lease rent payments. Investing activities. Our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our resorts. Capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms . Cash provided by investing activities was $2.1 billion in 2022 compared to $1.5 billion in 2021 . In 2022, we received $4.4 billion in net cash proceeds related to the VICI Transaction and $1.1 billion in net cash proceeds related to the sale of the operations of The Mirage, which were partially offset by cash paid of $1.6 billion to acquire The Cosmopolitan, net of cash acquired, cash paid of $279 million in connection with the LeoVegas tender offer, net of cash acquired, cash paid of $183 million to acquire shares of LeoVegas in the open market during the tender offer period, payments of $765 million in capital expenditures, as further discussed below, contributions of $225 million to our unconsolidated affiliate, BetMGM, and $282 million in net investments in debt securities . In comparison, in the prior year period, we received $3.9 billion in net cash proceeds from the sale of the real estate of Aria and Vdara, received $107 44 million in net proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, primarily related to the sale of art, which were partially offset by our payments of $1.8 billion to acquire CityCenter, net of cash acquired, $491 million in capital expenditures, as further discussed below, and contributions of $225 million to BetMGM. Capital Expenditures In 2022, we made capital expenditures of $765 million, of which $31 million related to MGM China. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate and other entities of $734 million were primarily related to expenditures in information technology, room remodels, and convention center remodels. In 2021, we made capital expenditures of $491 million, of which $68 million related to MGM China. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $49 million primarily related to construction of the Emerald Tower project at MGM Cotai and $19 million related to projects at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of $423 million were primarily related to expenditures in information technology and room remodels. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities was $3.0 billion in 2022 compared to $2.8 billion in 2021. In 2022 , we had net borrowings of debt of $78 million, as further discussed below, distributed $211 million to noncontrolling interest owners, and we repurchased $2.8 billion of our common stock. In comparison, in the prior year period, we had net repayments of debt of $1.3 billion, as further discussed below, distributed $324 million to noncontrolling interest owners, and we repurchased $1.8 billion of our common stock, partially offset by net proceeds received of $793 million from the issuance of MGP's Class A shares. Borrowings and Repayments of Long-term Debt In 2022, we had net borrowings of debt of $78 million, which consisted of net draws of $40 million on MGP OP revolving credit facility, net borrowings of $884 million on MGM China first revolving credit facility and borrowings of $224 million on MGM China second revolving credit facility t o fund an increase in share capital of MGM Grand Paradise pursuant to the capital requirements under the new Macau gaming law and for general corporate purposes, partially offset by the repayment of $1.0 billion of aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% senior notes due 2022 at maturity, and the repayments of $30 million of LeoVegas senior unsecured notes and $40 million of LeoVegas revolving credit facility due to change-in-control provisions. In 2021, we had net repayments of debt of $1.3 billion, which consisted of the repayment of the $1.7 billion outstanding on CityCenter's credit facility in full, which was assumed in the acquisition, using cash on hand, and net repayments of $407 million on MGM China first revolving credit facility. These repayments were partially offset by MGM China March 2021 issuance of $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior notes due 2027 at an issue price of 99.97% and net draws of $40 million on MGP OP's revolving credit facility, of which $35 million was used in connection with MGP acquisition of MGM Springfield with the remainder used to fund MGP OP and MGP distribution and dividend payments. The net proceeds from MGM China 4.75% senior notes due 2027 issuance were used to partially repay amounts outstanding under the MGM China first revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. Dividends, Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners and Share Repurchases In 2022, we repurchased and retired $2.8 billion of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plans. In connection with those repurchases, the February 2020 $3.0 billion stock repurchase plan was completed. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining availability under the March 2022 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was $475 million. Additionally, in February 2023, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan. In 2021, we repurchased and retired $1.8 billion of our common stock pursuant to our May 2018 $2.0 billion and February 2020 $3.0 billion stock repurchase plans. In connection with those repurchases, we completed our May 2018 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan. In March 2022, June 2022, September 2022, and December 2022, we paid dividends of $0.0025 per share, totaling $4 million for 2022. In March 2021, June 2021, September 2021, and December 2021, we paid dividends of $0.0025 per share, totaling $5 million for 2021. 45 MGP OP paid the following distributions to its partnership unit holders during 2022 and 2021: $283 million of distributions paid in 2022, of which we received $117 million and MGP receiv ed $166 million, which MGP concurrently paid as a dividend to its Class A shareholders; and $545 million of distributions paid in 2021, of which we received $243 million and MGP receiv ed $302 million, which MGP concurrently paid as a dividend to its Class A shareholders. Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Anticipated Uses of Cash We require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts. In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. Funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resorts daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. In addition, from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities subject to limitations in our revolving credit facility and Delaware law, as applicable. We have significant outstanding debt, interest payments, rent payments, and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures and commitments . As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 billion, of which MGM China held $860 million. In addition to the cash and cash equivalents, MGM China also had approximately $124 million of restricted cash. At December 31, 2022, we had $8.8 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including $1.2 billion outstanding under MGM China first revolving credit facility and $224 million outstanding under MGM China second revolving credit facility. No amounts were drawn on our revolving credit facility. We have $1.3 billion of debt maturing in the next twelve months, which we expect to repay with cash on hand. Due to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in February 2022, MGM China further amended each of its first revolving credit facility and its second revolving credit facility to extend the financial covenant waivers through maturity in May 2024. Our estimated cash interest payments, based on principal amounts of debt outstanding and the contractual maturity dates and interest rates as of December 31, 2022, for 2023, 2024, and 2025 are approximately $230 million, $190 million, and $145 million, respectively, excluding MGM China, and approximately $480 million, $355 million, and $235 million, respectively, on a consolidated basis, which includes MGM China. We are also required as of December 31, 2022 to make annual cash rent payments of $1.7 billion over the next twelve months under triple-net lease agreements, which triple-net leases are also subject to annual escalators and also require us to pay substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, ground lease payments, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the annual cash rent. See Note 11 for discussion of our leases and lease obligations. We have planned capital expenditures in 2023 of approximately $795 million to $835 million domestically, which is inclusive of the capital expenditures required under the triple-net lease agreements, each of which requires us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the respective domestic properties, and an estimate of approximately $110 million to $150 million at MGM China. Refer to Note 12 for discussion of MGM Grand Paradise commitment to investment in gaming and non-gaming projects and the development of international tourist markets as well as other contractual obligations pursuant to its gaming concession. The estimated amount of the investment for 2023 that relates to capital projects is included within the capital expenditure amounts above. We additionally have planned contributions to BetMGM in 2023 of approximately $75 million. We continue to explore potential development or investment opportunities, such as a commercial gaming facility in New York and our venture in Japan, which may require cash commitments in the future. We also expect to continue to repurchase shares pursuant to our share repurchase plans. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we repurchased approximately 6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $38.12 per share for an aggregate amount of $210 million . Repurchased shares were retired. On February 8, 2023, we announced that the Board of Directors has determined to suspend the ongoing dividends in light of our current preferred method of returning value to shareholders through our share repurchase plan. To the extent we determine to reinstate the dividend in the future, determinations regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our results of operations, financial condition, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant . 46 For additional information related to our long-term obligations, refer to the maturities of long-term debt table in Note 9 and the lease liability maturity table in Note 11. Principal Debt Arrangements See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding our debt agreements as of December 31, 2022. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. We regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates, where the estimates and assumptions involve both a significant level of estimation uncertainty due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for the matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change is high and also have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates. Loss Reserve for Casino Receivables Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our Las Vegas resorts. Our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well. MGM China extends credit to certain in-house VIP gaming customers. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts, including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States and Macau. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. We consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when we issue credit to customers at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the United States. MGM China performs background checks and investigates credit worthiness prior to issuing credit. We maintain a loss reserve for casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. Expected credit losses, an operating expense, increases the loss reserve. We regularly evaluate the loss reserve for casino accounts, which involves judgments and assumptions about realizability, current and expected future economic conditions in various geographies, and business conditions. At domestic resorts where marker play is not significant, the loss reserve is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances, which is supported by ongoing evaluation of relevant historical analysis and any other known information such as the current economic conditions that could drive losses. At domestic resorts where marker play is significant, we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer current and expected future financial condition, collection history, and current and expected future economic conditions. MGM China specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account, the financial condition and the collection history of the customer. Approximately $54 million and $63 million of casino receivables and $25 million and $31 million of the loss reserve for casino receivables relate to MGM China at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables: December 31, 2022 2021 (In thousands) Casino receivables $ 500,986 $ 380,907 Loss reserve for casino accounts receivable 97,929 117,539 Loss reserve as a percentage of casino accounts receivable 20 % 31 % The loss reserve as a percentage of casino accounts receivable decreased in the current year primarily due to a decrease in the age of outstanding receivables. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the loss reserve and credit losses can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes 47 known or as changes in economic conditions occur. At December 31, 2022, a 100 basis-point change in the loss reserve as a percentage of casino receivables would change income before income taxes by $5 million. Fixed Asset Capitalization Property and equipment are stated at cost. A significant amount of our property and equipment was acquired through business combinations and was therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. When we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries. We must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense, or a capital asset is a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also may be a matter of judgment. In addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives. We determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively. Impairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets We evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used. Several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset. For operating assets, fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses. There are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets. First, management must determine the usage of the asset. To the extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized. Assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. This means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets. Future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. On a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment. Potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economic factors, significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. We estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group, including potential sale. Historically, undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. We perform our annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights and trademarks. For our 2022 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a qualitative ( step zero ) analysis for certain of our indefinite-lived intangibles and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. As discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. If certain future operating results do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of the intangibles to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in an impairment charge. We review goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. None of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2022. For our 2022 annual impairment tests, we either utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the 48 fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin or we elected to perform a quantitative analysis and the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value by a substantial margin. There are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment. In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. If future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. In addition, the determination of multiples, capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions or events outside of our control. The value of our Empire City reporting unit is dependent upon us obtaining a commercial gaming license and the timing thereof, as well as other assumptions that may change throughout the bidding process as additional information becomes known, which includes the size, scope, and timing of constructing an expanded facility, the potential for and timing of a transaction for the monetization of the improvements and the proceeds and any rent associated with such transaction, and the incremental cash flows generated by the expanded facility, such as license payments and other payments to government entities, gaming tax rates, and forecasted revenue and expenses from operations. While the quantitative impairment analysis performed in 2022 resulted in the fair value of Empire City exceeding its carrying value by a substantial margin based upon the assumptions as of the date of the analysis, any of these assumptions could change materially as a result of new or additional information and, if they do, could result in an impairment of up to the full amount of the reporting unit goodwill of $256 million. See Note 2 and Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets. Long-lived assets - MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession In connection with the enactment of the new Macau gaming law in June 2022, that provides for material changes to the legal form of gaming concessions in Macau, including discontinuing and prohibiting gaming subconcessions subsequent to their expiration, which occurred on December 31, 2022, and provided for other material changes to the rights and obligations provided for under new gaming concessions, we determined that MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession and new gaming concession are two separate units of account. Further, as the material changes in the legal and regulatory environment could have had an adverse effect on the value of MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession, we concluded that a trigger event had occurred in June 2022 for the MGM China asset group. The gaming subconcession was an entity-wide asset of MGM China as the benefit of the right to conduct gaming provided by the gaming subconcession was shared by each of MGM China casino resorts and the cash flows generated by the gaming subconcession cannot be separated from the casino resorts in which gaming operations are conducted. We determined that the real estate is the primary asset of the asset group as the real estate component generates a significant portion of the entity cash flows through gaming operations conducted at its casino resorts. Accordingly, cash flows were projected over the remaining useful life of the real estate, including cash flows from gaming operations. The estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset group significantly exceeded the carrying value; accordingly, no impairment was indicated. There were several estimates inherent in evaluating the gaming subconcession asset for impairment. The determination of the asset group to be tested for recoverability and the primary asset of the asset group are matters of judgment as it is dependent on corporate structure, the legal and regulatory environment in which the entity operates, and the level of interdependency between assets used in revenue generating activities. The determination of the primary asset directly affects the period over which cash flows are forecasted when performing the recoverability test. In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, the determination of undiscounted cash flows used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of land concession renewals and successfully obtaining a gaming concession in connection with future public tenders. Additionally, we reassessed the useful life of the gaming subconcession intangible asset and, given the new gaming law and the resulting changes described above, we determined that the useful life would no longer be based on the initial term of the MGM Cotai land concession that ends in January 2038, and that the new useful life is consistent with the remaining contractual term of the existing gaming subconcession, which ended on December 31, 2022. Accordingly, amortization of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession was recognized on a straight-line basis over its reduced useful life, thereby accelerating the recognition of amortization within our statements of operations. The determination of the unit of account and useful life of the gaming subconcession are based upon facts and circumstances as of a point in time and may change as such conditions develop, evolve, or change. We have determined the 49 unit of account and useful life based upon the final gaming law and its enactment in June 2022 as the enactment reflects the finalization of the changes in legal form and rights and obligations related to gaming concessions in Macau. Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates See Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates. During 2022, our investments in unconsolidated affiliates had no material impairments. In 2021 and 2020, we recorded $22 million and $64 million, respectively, in other-than-temporary impairment charges on equity method investments. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities related to net operating losses, tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences with future tax consequences. We reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on such "more-likely-than-not" realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies. We recorded a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of our domestic jurisdictions of $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets of foreign jurisdictions of $245 million and $149 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We reassess the realization of deferred tax assets each reporting period. In the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination. Likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located. Furthermore, we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax provision, net income and cash flows. Refer to Note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to income taxes. 50
