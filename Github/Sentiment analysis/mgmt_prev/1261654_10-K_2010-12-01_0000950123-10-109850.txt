ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with the Selected Financial Data and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those we discuss under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K. General Overview We are the leading provider of postsecondary education for students seeking careers as professional automotive, diesel, collision repair, motorcycle and marine technicians as measured by total average undergraduate enrollment and graduates. We offer undergraduate degree, diploma or certificate programs at 11 campuses across the United States. We also offer manufacturer specific advanced training programs that are sponsored by the manufacturer or dealer, at dedicated training centers. We have provided technical education for 45 years. Our revenues consist principally of student tuition and fees derived from the programs we provide and are presented after reductions related to discounts and scholarships we sponsor, refunds for students who withdraw from our programs prior to specified dates and the portion of tuition students have funded through our proprietary loan program. We generally recognize tuition revenue and fees ratably over the terms of the various programs we offer. We supplement our tuition revenues with additional revenues from sales of textbooks and program supplies, student housing and other revenues, all of which are recognized as sales occur or services are performed. In aggregate, these additional revenues represented less than 3% of our total revenues in each year for the three-year period ended September 30, 2010. Tuition revenue and fees generally vary based on the average number of students enrolled and average tuition charged per program. Average student enrollments vary depending on, among other factors, the number of (i) continuing students at the beginning of a period, (ii) new student enrollments during the period, (iii) students who have previously withdrawn but decide to re-enroll during the period, and (iv) graduations and withdrawals during the period. Our average student enrollments are influenced by the attractiveness of our program offerings to high school graduates and potential adult students, the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, the depth of our industry relationships, the strength of employment markets and long term career prospects, the quality of our instructors and student services professionals, the persistence of our students, the length of our education programs, the availability of federal and alternative funding for our programs, the number of graduates of our programs who elect to attend the advanced training programs we offer and general economic conditions. Our introduction of additional program offerings at existing schools and opening additional schools is expected to influence our average student enrollment. We currently offer start dates at our campuses that range from every three to six weeks throughout the year in our various undergraduate programs. The number of start dates of advanced programs varies by the duration of those programs and the needs of the manufacturers who sponsor them. Our tuition charges vary by type and length of our programs and the program level, such as undergraduate or advanced training. Tuition rates have increased by approximately 3% to 5% per annum in each year in the three-year 45 Table of Contents period ended September 30, 2010. We continually evaluate our tuition pricing based on individual campus markets, the competitive environment and ED regulations. Most students at our campuses rely on funds received under various government-sponsored student financial aid programs, predominantly Title IV Programs, to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education-related expenses. In 2010, approximately 73% of our revenues, on a cash basis, as defined by the U.S. Department of Education (ED), were derived from federal student financial aid programs. We extend credit for tuition and fees, for a limited period of time, to the majority of our students. Our credit risk is mitigated through the students participation in federally funded financial aid programs unless students withdraw prior to the receipt by us of Title IV funds for those students. In addition, we bear all credit and collection risk for the portion of our student tuition that is funded under our proprietary loan program. We categorize our operating expenses as (i) educational services and facilities and (ii) selling, general and administrative. Major components of educational services and facilities expenses include faculty and other campus administration employees compensation and benefits, facility rent, maintenance, utilities, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment used in the provision of educational services, tools, training aids, royalties under our licensing arrangements and other costs directly associated with teaching our programs and providing educational services to our students. Selling, general and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits of employees who are not directly associated with the provision of educational services, such as executive management; finance and central accounting; legal; human resources; marketing and student enrollment expenses, including compensation and benefits of personnel employed in sales and marketing and student admissions; costs of professional services; bad debt expense; costs associated with the implementation and operation of our student management and reporting system; rent for our home office; depreciation and amortization of property and equipment that is not used in the provision of educational services and other costs that are incidental to our operations. All marketing and student enrollment expenses are recognized in the period incurred. Costs related to the opening of new facilities, excluding related capital expenditures, are expensed in the period incurred or when services are provided. 2010 Overview Operations Our average undergraduate full-time student enrollment increased 17.0% to 18,600 students for the year ended September 30, 2010, resulting in revenue growth of 18.9%. Our revenues for the year ended September 30, 2010 were $435.9 million, an increase of $69.3 million from the prior year, and our net income for the year was $28.8 million, an increase of $17.1 million from the prior year. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in average undergraduate full-time student enrollment, an increase in tuition rates and a decrease in tuition scholarships. Our revenues excluded $9.7 million of tuition revenue related to students participating in our proprietary loan program. Additionally, our revenues related to our industry training programs declined during the year. The increase in our average undergraduate full-time student enrollment drove an increase in student centric variable costs including compensation and related benefits, supplies and maintenance, tools and training aids. Additionally, our advertising expense increased to generate additional high quality student inquiries to support future student enrollments. Student starts increased by 10.7% for the year ended September 30, 2010, as compared to an increase of 16.6% for the year ended September 30, 2009. The increase in starts is a result of the investments we made in our student recruitment representatives as well as the recruitment, training and development of additional financial aid and future student advisors during 2009. Additionally, although not quantifiable, we believe broader economic conditions have contributed to a portion of our recent enrollment growth. In 2011, we anticipate low single digit start growth. 46 Table of Contents Given the solid performance in 2010 and the uncertain regulatory environment, we expect growth in new students and average enrollments to moderate in the coming year while improving financial results and operating margins. Regulatory Environment On October 29, 2010, ED issued final regulations pertaining to certain aspects of the administration of Title IV Programs. With minor exceptions, these regulations will become effective July 1, 2011. ED previously announced that it was delaying until early 2011 publication of final regulations on certain further proposed gainful employment regulations, which are expected to become effective July 1, 2012 or thereafter. Currently, we have identified the rules concerning gainful employment, compensation, the definition of a credit hour and the broadened definition of misrepresentation as the rules most likely to materially impact our business. We are in the process of reviewing and assessing the likely impact of the October 29, 2010 final regulations on our operations. Compliance with these final rules could have a material impact on the manner in which we conduct our business and the results of operations. We cannot currently predict how significant any such impact will be. For a description of additional information regarding these regulatory changes, see Business Regulatory Environment Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs Final rulemaking by the U.S. Department of Education included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K. Dividend Payment On July 16, 2010 we paid a special cash dividend of $1.50 per share totaling $36.3 million to common stockholders of record as of July 6, 2010. We continuously evaluate our cash position in light of growth opportunities, operating results and general market conditions. Periodically, we may return shareholder earnings through cash dividends or stock repurchases, or a combination thereof. New Campus We opened a new campus in Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas in June 2010, providing our Automotive Technology II program at the time of opening. For the year ended September 30, 2010, this campus had revenues of $1.2 million and operating expenses of $8.3 million. We anticipate this new campus will become profitable within 9 to 15 months after opening. We have invested approximately $19.7 million in the building and land purchase, building improvements and equipment through September 30, 2010. We anticipate offering our Automotive/Diesel Technology II training program in 2011 at this campus. Curriculum Transformation We are transforming our Automotive Technology and Diesel Technology program curricula to a blend of daily instructor-led theory and hands-on lab training complemented by web-based training, which is reflective of current industry training methods and standards. In addition to improving the overall educational experience for our students, the new curricula offer more convenience and training flexibility for our students while meeting industry standards. We began offering the new curricula at the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas campus at the time of opening. We intend to integrate the new curricula at our other campuses in the future. To date we have invested approximately $15.1 million for this transformation and anticipate investing within the range of $4.0 million to $6.0 million during 2011. 47 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected statement of operations data as a percentage of revenues for each of the periods indicated. Year Ended September 30, 2010 2009 2008 Revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Operating expenses: Educational services and facilities 48.8 % 52.8 % 54.4 % Selling, general and administrative 40.6 % 42.1 % 42.5 % Total operating expenses 89.4 % 94.9 % 96.9 % Income from operations 10.6 % 5.1 % 3.1 % Interest income 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.9 % Other income 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.1 % Total other income 0.2 % 0.2 % 1.0 % Income before income taxes 10.8 % 5.3 % 4.1 % Income tax expense 4.2 % 2.1 % 1.7 % Net income 6.6 % 3.2 % 2.4 % Our earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the years ending September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $67.8 million, $37.5 million and $28.9 million, respectively. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which is provided to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. We choose to disclose to investors this non-GAAP financial measure because it provides an additional analytical tool to clarify our results from operations and helps to identify underlying trends. Additionally, such measure helps compare our performance on a consistent basis across time periods. To obtain a complete understanding of our performance, this measure should be examined in connection with net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Since the items excluded from this measure are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance under GAAP, this measure should not be considered to be an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating performance or profitability. Exclusion of items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure across companies. Investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating our financial performance. EBITDA reconciles to net income as follows: Year Ended September 30, 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net income $ 28,828 $ 11,733 $ 8,216 Interest income, net (250 ) (198 ) (3,146 ) Income tax expense 18,451 7,572 5,805 Depreciation and amortization 20,803 18,417 18,052 EBITDA $ 67,832 $ 37,524 $ 28,927 Return on equity for the trailing four quarters ended September 30, 2010 was 25.6% compared to 11.3% for the trailing four quarters ended September 30, 2009. Return on equity is calculated as the sum of our net income for the last four quarters divided by the average of our total shareholders equity balances at the end of each of the last five quarters. 48 Table of Contents Capacity utilization is the ratio of our average undergraduate full-time student enrollment to total seats available. Total seats available represents our maximum capacity, however, due to certain dynamics, our operating capacity tends to be lower. The following table sets forth our average capacity utilization during each of the periods indicated and the total seats available at the end of each of the periods indicated: Year Ended September 30, 2010 2009 2008 Average undergraduate full-time student enrollment 18,600 15,900 14,900 Total seats available 27,200 24,800 25,000 Average capacity utilization 68.4 % 64.1 % 59.6 % During the years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we started 19,500 students, 17,600 students, and 15,100 students, respectively. The increase in our total seats available was primarily due to classrooms transferred to our Automotive Technology programs as a result of reductions in and discontinuation of training for certain manufacturer specific training programs and the opening of our Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas campus. During 2011, we plan to continue to seek alternate uses for our underutilized space at existing campuses. Alternate uses may include subleasing space to third parties, allocating additional space for use by our manufacturer specific advanced training programs, adding new industry relationships or consolidating administrative functions into campus facilities. Year Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2009 Revenues. Our revenues for the year ended September 30, 2010 were $435.9 million, representing an increase of $69.3 million, or 18.9%, as compared to revenues of $366.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2009. The increase was due to a 17.0% increase in the average undergraduate full-time student enrollment, tuition increases of between 3% and 5%, depending on the program, and a decrease of approximately $1.1 million in tuition scholarships. Our revenues for the year ended September 30, 2010 excluded $9.7 million of tuition revenue related to students participating in our proprietary loan program. In accordance with our accounting policy, we will recognize the related revenue as payments are received from the students participating in this program. In addition, industry training revenue decreased by $6.5 million due to reductions in and discontinuation of training for certain manufacturer specific training programs. Educational services and facilities expenses. Our educational services and facilities expenses for the year ended September 30, 2010 were $212.6 million, representing an increase of $19.1 million, or 9.9%, as compared to $193.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2009. The following table sets forth the significant components of our educational services and facilities expenses: % of Revenues Year Ended September 30, Year Ended September 30, 2010 2009 2010 2009 (In thousands) Compensation and related costs $ 111,515 $ 102,061 25.6 % 27.8 % Occupancy costs 36,410 36,175 8.4 % 9.9 % Other educational services and facilities expenses 23,993 21,306 5.5 % 5.8 % Depreciation expense 15,632 14,838 3.6 % 4.1 % Tools and training aids expense 13,108 9,183 3.0 % 2.5 % Supplies and maintenance 11,919 9,927 2.7 % 2.7 % $ 212,577 $ 193,490 48.8 % 52.8 % The increase in average undergraduate full-time student enrollment drove the increase in student centric variable costs including compensation and related costs, supplies and maintenance and tools and training aids. 49 Table of Contents The significant components of educational services and facilities expenses at our Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas campus included $1.1 million related to tools and training aids and $0.9 million in compensation costs for instructors and other staff during the year ended September 30, 2010. We anticipate our compensation and related costs will increase during 2011 due to planned increased staffing necessary to support teaching the Diesel and Industrial program at our Rancho Cucamonga, California campus and in support of anticipated growth in average undergraduate full-time student enrollments at our Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas campus. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2010 were $176.8 million, an increase of $22.3 million, or 14.4%, as compared to $154.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2009. The following table sets forth the significant components of our selling, general and administrative expenses: % of Revenues Year Ended September 30, Year Ended September 30, 2010 2009 2010 2009 (In thousands) Compensation and related costs $ 100,804 $ 90,228 23.1 % 24.6 % Advertising costs 32,552 23,708 7.5 % 6.5 % Other selling, general and administrative expenses 31,164 27,265 7.2 % 7.4 % Bad debt expense 6,520 6,732 1.5 % 1.8 % Contract services expense 5,754 6,571 1.3 % 1.8 % $ 176,794 $ 154,504 40.6 % 42.1 % Total compensation and related costs increased by approximately $10.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2010 as a result of an increase in the number of staff to support the growth associated with the increase in average undergraduate full-time student enrollments and an increase in the number of sales force representatives who were hired to drive an increase in the number of enrollments. Additionally, bonus expense increased $2.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2010, due to improved operating results. We anticipate our compensation and related costs will increase during 2011 due to planned increased staffing to support the transformation of our Automotive Technology and Diesel Technology program curricula. Advertising expense increased $8.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2010 primarily due to an increase in our advertising spend to generate high quality inquiries to support future student enrollments. We anticipate our advertising expense will continue to increase in 2011 due to higher overall advertising costs. We anticipate our depreciation expense will increase during 2011 due to the investment in the transformation of our Automotive Technology and Diesel Technology program curricula and leasehold improvements and equipment necessary to begin offering our Diesel and Industrial program at our Rancho Cucamonga, California campus. Income taxes. Our provision for income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2010 was $18.5 million, or 39.0% of pre-tax income compared with $7.6 million or 39.2% of pre-tax income for the year ended September 30, 2009. The effective income tax rate in each year differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35% primarily as a result of state income taxes, net of related federal income tax benefits. Net income. As a result of the foregoing, we reported net income for the year ended September 30, 2010 of $28.8 million, as compared to net income of $11.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2009. Year Ended September 30, 2009 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2008 Revenues. Our revenues for the year ended September 30, 2009 were $366.6 million, representing an increase of $23.2 million, or 6.7%, as compared to revenues of $343.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2008. The increase was due to a 6.1% increase in the average undergraduate full-time student enrollment, tuition 50 Table of Contents increases of between 3% and 5%, depending on the program, and a decrease of approximately $1.5 million in tuition scholarships. Our revenues for the year ended September 30, 2009 excluded $8.0 million of tuition revenue related to students participating in our proprietary loan program. In accordance with our accounting policy, we will recognize the related revenue as payments are received from the students participating in this program. In addition, industry training revenue decreased by $2.0 million due to adjustments to the training calendars for certain manufacturer specific training programs. The manufacturers we work with periodically review their technician hiring and training needs which results in adjustments to the training schedules and staffing requirements. Certain manufacturers performed such an assessment this year which resulted in a reduction in the number of courses offered. We also experienced one less earning day in 2009, which resulted in a decrease to revenue of $1.4 million. Educational services and facilities expenses. Our educational services and facilities expenses for the year ended September 30, 2009 were $193.5 million, representing an increase of $6.9 million, or 3.7%, as compared to $186.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2008. The following table sets forth the significant components of our educational services and facilities expenses: % of Revenues Year Ended September 30, Year Ended September 30, 2009 2008 2009 2008 (In thousands) Compensation and related costs $ 102,061 $ 96,506 27.8 % 28.1 % Occupancy costs 36,175 36,068 9.9 % 10.5 % Other educational services and facilities expenses 25,010 24,607 6.8 % 7.1 % Depreciation expense 14,838 14,936 4.1 % 4.4 % Tools and training aids expense 9,183 9,112 2.5 % 2.7 % Contract services expense 6,223 5,411 1.7 % 1.6 % $ 193,490 $ 186,640 52.8 % 54.4 % Total compensation and related costs increased by approximately $5.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2009 primarily due to increases in salaries, bonuses and benefits. Salaries increased $4.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2009 primarily due to the growth in applications and our related investment in the recruitment, training, and development of additional financial aid and future student advisors to ensure we provide a high level of service to our future students. The increase in salaries also included $0.6 million in severance for instructors and support staff impacted by the reduction in courses offered for certain manufacturer training programs during the year and the cancellation of the Audi of America, Inc. and Volkswagen of America, Inc. training agreements in September 2009. Bonus expense increased by $0.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2009 due to improved operating results for the year. Benefits expense increased $0.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2009 primarily due to increased expenses under our self-insured employee benefit plans, although benefits as a percentage of total compensation decreased for the current year. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2009 were $154.5 million, an increase of $8.4 million, or 5.7%, as compared to $146.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2008. 51 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the significant components of our selling, general and administrative expenses: % of Revenues Year Ended September 30, Year Ended September 30, 2009 2008 2009 2008 (In thousands) Compensation and related costs $ 90,228 $ 78,751 24.6 % 22.9 % Other selling, general and administrative expenses 27,265 28,413 7.4 % 8.2 % Advertising costs 23,708 26,400 6.5 % 7.7 % Contract services expense 6,732 8,180 1.8 % 2.4 % Bad debt expense 6,571 4,379 1.8 % 1.3 % $ 154,504 $ 146,123 42.1 % 42.5 % Compensation and related costs increased due to increases in salaries, bonuses and benefits expense, partially offset by costs capitalized in connection with the transformation of our automotive and diesel curriculum and a decrease in stock compensation expense. Salaries expense increased $8.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2009 primarily due to an increase in the number of information technology employees hired to fill open positions and an increase in the number of sales force representatives who were hired in response to the increase in the number and quality of inquiries we have been experiencing. The increase in salaries was also due to $1.6 million in severance related to the departure of executives during the year ended September 30, 2009 compared to $1.0 million in severance related to the departure of executives during the year ended September 30, 2008. Bonuses increased $2.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2009, due to improved operating results. Benefits expense increased $1.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2009 primarily due to increased expenses under our self-insured employee benefit plans. The increases were partially offset by an increase of $0.8 million in salaries and related costs we capitalized related to employees involved in the transformation of our automotive and diesel curriculum. The increases were also offset by a decrease of $0.6 million in stock-based compensation expense due to the departure of executives who forfeited stock-based awards. Advertising expense decreased $2.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2009 primarily due to successful inquiry generation campaigns that require fewer sponsorships of national television programs and less local market promotion of specific campuses than in prior periods. Bad debt expense increased $2.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2009, due to changes in the student funding environment, internal execution challenges, and the declining general economic conditions experienced over the past eighteen months. Contract services expense decreased $1.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2009 primarily due to a decrease of $1.2 million for contract employees as open positions were filled in our information technology and finance departments. Interest income. Our interest income for the year ended September 30, 2009 was $0.2 million, representing a decrease of $3.0 million, or 92%, compared to interest income of $3.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2008. The decrease in interest income was attributable to reductions in available interest rates, our decision to change to a more conservative investment strategy in the current economic environment, and reduced amounts available for investment as a result of share repurchases totaling $16.9 million during 2009. Income taxes. Our provision for income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2009 was $7.6 million, or 39.2% of pre-tax income compared with $5.8 million or 41.4% of pre-tax income for the year ended September 30, 2008. The effective income tax rate in each year differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35% primarily as a result of state income taxes, net of related federal income tax benefits. The decrease in the tax rate as a percentage of pretax income was primarily attributable to the establishment of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating losses in 2008. Net income. As a result of the foregoing, we reported net income for the year ended September 30, 2009 of $11.7 million, as compared to net income of $8.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2008. 52 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash flow from operations, cash on hand and investments will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through the next 12 months. We believe that the strategic use of our cash resources includes funding our new campus as well as subsidizing funding alternatives for our students. In addition, we evaluate the repurchase of our common stock, payment of dividends, consideration of strategic acquisitions and other potential uses of cash. To the extent that potential acquisitions are large enough to require financing beyond cash from operations, we may issue debt resulting in increased interest expense. Our aggregate cash and cash equivalents and current investments were $77.5 million and $81.3 million at September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. A majority of our revenues are derived from Title IV Programs. Federal regulations dictate the timing of disbursements of funds under Title IV Programs. Students must apply for a new loan for each academic year consisting of thirty-week periods. Loan funds are generally provided by lenders in two disbursements for each academic year. The first disbursement is usually received after the start of a student academic year and the second disbursement is typically received at the beginning of the sixteenth week from the start of the student academic year. We established a proprietary loan program in which we bear all credit and collection risk and students are not required to begin repayment until six months after the student completes or withdraws from his or her program. These factors, together with the timing of when our students begin their programs, affect our operating cash flow. Operating Activities Our net cash provided by operating activities was $67.5 million, $49.5 million and $21.1 million for the years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase from 2009 to 2010 is primarily attributable to higher net income resulting from increased revenues due to an increase in our average undergraduate full-time student enrollment. The increase from 2008 to 2009 is primarily attributable to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. During the year ended September 30, 2010, the changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in cash inflows of $10.0 million. The inflows were a result of a $15.1 million increase in deferred revenue primarily due to the timing of student starts, the number of students in school and where they were at year end in relation to the completion of their program coupled with an increase in average undergraduate full-time student enrollment at September 30, 2010 compared to September 30, 2009. The inflows are also due to a $6.0 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily attributable to an increase in accrued bonuses as a result of improved operating results. There was a use of cash as a result of an increase in receivables by $9.9 million due to an increase in our average undergraduate full-time student enrollment. During the year ended September 30, 2009, the changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in cash inflows of $10.0 million. The inflows were primarily attributable to a $7.0 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily due to an increase in accrued bonuses as a result of improved operating results. The inflows are also due to a $3.5 million increase in deferred revenue which was primarily attributable to the timing of student starts, the number of students in school and where they were at year end in relation to the completion of their program coupled with an increase in average undergraduate full-time student enrollment at September 30, 2009 compared to September 30, 2008. During the year ended September 30, 2008, the changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in cash outflows of $15.1 million. The outflows were primarily attributable to a $11.3 million increase in receivables. In-school student receivables increased due to the challenges we experienced in our student financial aid process due to the changing student funding environment and the resulting delay in receiving student financial aid funding used to settle students in-school receivable. The outflows are also due to a $4.7 million decrease in deferred revenue which was primarily attributable to the timing of student starts, the number of students in school and where they were at year end in relation to the completion of their program and an increase in need-based tuition scholarships. 53 Table of Contents Investing Activities During the year ended September 30, 2010, cash used in investing activities was $42.1 million and was primarily related to our investment in new and replacement training equipment for our ongoing operations. The following is a summary of our significant investments in capital expenditure activities. We invested approximately $10.5 million in building improvements and equipment for the Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas campus. We invested approximately $10.3 million in the transformation of our Automotive Technology and Diesel Technology program curricula. During the year ended September 30, 2011, we anticipate our investment in capital expenditures will be relatively consistent with the year ended September 30, 2010. We anticipate investing in the range of $4.0 million to $6.0 million in the transformation of our Automotive Technology and Diesel Technology program curricula and $3.5 million to $4.0 million in leasehold improvements and equipment necessary to begin offering our Diesel and Industrial program at our Rancho Cucamonga, California campus. During the year ended September 30, 2009, cash used in investing activities was approximately $57.4 million and was primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment, capital improvements and the purchase of investments. The following is a summary of our significant investments in capital expenditure activities. We invested approximately $9.3 million to purchase facilities for the Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas campus in addition to leasehold improvements at a temporary facility for this campus. We invested approximately $4.8 million in the transformation of our Automotive Technology and Diesel Technology program curricula. During the year ended September 30, 2008, cash provided by investing activities was $13.0 million and was primarily related to proceeds received from the sale of the Norwood, Massachusetts campus facility. Capital expenditures associated with existing campus expansions and ongoing replacement of equipment related to student training resulted in cash used of $17.7 million. Financing Activities During the year ended September 30, 2010, cash used in financing activities was $32.6 million and was primarily attributable to the payment of a special cash dividend in July 2010 of $1.50 per share totaling $36.3 million to common stockholders of record as of July 6, 2010. During the year ended September 30, 2009, cash used in financing activities was $16.8 million and was attributable to the repurchase of our stock. During the year ended September 30, 2008, cash used in financing activities was $28.8 million and was attributable to the repurchase of our stock. Dividends We continuously evaluate our cash position in light of growth opportunities, operating results and general market conditions. Periodically, we may return shareholder earnings through cash dividends or stock repurchases, or a combination thereof. Stock Repurchase Program Our Board of Directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to $70.0 million of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The timing and actual number of shares purchased will depend on a variety of factors such as price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and prevailing market conditions. We may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time without prior notice. Through September 30, 2010, we purchased 3.4 million shares at an average price per share of $13.50 and a total cost of 54 Table of Contents approximately $46.4 million under this program. We did not make any purchases during the year ended September 30, 2010. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth, as of September 30, 2010, the aggregate amounts of our significant contractual obligations and commitments with definitive payment terms that will require cash outlays in the future. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1-3 3-5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (In thousands) Operating leases(1) $ 258,844 $ 25,962 $ 50,983 $ 51,428 $ 130,471 Purchase obligations(2) 42,099 18,943 13,001 4,839 5,316 Other long-term obligations 1,789 473 448 69 799 Total contractual cash obligations 302,732 45,378 64,432 56,336 136,586 Issued and outstanding surety bonds(3) 13,789 13,789 Total contractual commitments $ 316,521 $ 59,167 $ 64,432 $ 56,336 $ 136,586 (1) Minimum rental commitments.

Additionally, purchase orders outstanding as of September 30, 2010, employment contracts and minimum payments under licensing and royalty agreements are included. (3) Represents surety bonds posted on behalf of our schools and education representatives with multiple state education agencies. Related Party Transactions Information concerning related party transactions is included in Note 13 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements within Part II, Item 8 of this report. For a description of additional information regarding related party transactions, see the information included in our proxy statement for the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders under the heading Certain Relationships and Related Transactions . Seasonality Our revenues and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business, principally due to changes in total student population and costs associated with opening or expanding our campuses. Student population varies as a result of new student enrollments, graduations and student attrition. Historically, our schools have had lower student populations in our third quarter than in the remainder of our year because fewer students are enrolled during the summer months. Additionally, our schools have had higher student populations in our fourth quarter than in the remainder of the year because more students enroll during this period. Our expenses, however, do not vary significantly with changes in student population and revenues and, as a result, such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. We expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns. Such patterns may change, however, as a result of new school openings, new program introductions, increased enrollments of adult students or acquisitions. In addition, our revenues for the first quarter ending December 31 are impacted by the closure of our campuses for a week in December for a holiday break and accordingly we do not earn revenue during that closure period. Operating income is negatively impacted during the initial start up of new campus openings. We incur sales and marketing costs as well as campus personnel costs in advance of the campus opening. Typically we begin to 55 Table of Contents incur such costs approximately 12 to 15 months in advance of the campus opening with the majority of the costs being incurred in the nine month period prior to a campus opening.

The loss from operations during the three month period ending March 31, 2009 was primarily due to additional sales force representatives hired in response to our increase in quality inquiries, contract services expenses incurred for process improvement projects in financial aid and admissions and lower interest income due to a change in investments to lower risk, lower yielding mutual funds. The loss from operations during the three month period ending June 30, 2008 was primarily due to the increased investment in the new national advertising campaign, set-up fees associated with the proprietary loan program and a decline in average undergraduate full-time student enrollment. Our results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2010 include a pre-tax charge of $1.3 million ($0.8 million after tax) recorded during the fourth quarter to increase compensation expense by $1.0 million ($0.6 million after tax) and depreciation expense by $0.3 million ($0.2 million after tax). The $1.3 million pre-tax charge related to amounts which should have been recognized of $0.4 million, $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million during the first, second, third and fourth quarters of the year ended September 30, 2009, respectively, and of $0.3 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million during the first, second and third quarters of the year ended September 30, 2010, respectively. We determined that the impact of these out-of-period adjustments was immaterial to our results of operations for the applicable interim and annual periods during the years ended September 30, 2009 and 2010. As a result, we have not restated any prior period amounts. 56 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. During the preparation of these financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, our proprietary loan program, allowance for uncollectible accounts, investments, goodwill recoverability, bonus plans, self-insurance claim liabilities, income taxes, contingencies and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of our analysis form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 3 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements within Part II, Item 8 of this Report. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. Revenue recognition. Revenues consist primarily of student tuition and fees derived from the programs we provide after reductions are made for discounts and scholarships we sponsor. Tuition and fee revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the course or program offered. If a student withdraws from a program prior to a specified date, all or a portion of deferred tuition revenue is refunded. Approximately 97% of our revenues for each of the years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 consisted of tuition. Our undergraduate programs are typically designed to be completed in 45 to 96 weeks and our advanced training programs range from 14 to 24 weeks in duration. We supplement our revenues with sales of textbooks and program supplies, student housing and other revenues. Sales of textbooks and program supplies, revenue related to student housing and other revenue are each recognized as sales occur or services are performed. Deferred revenue represents the excess of tuition and fee payments received, as compared to tuition and fees earned, and is reflected as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheets because it is expected to be earned within the next twelve months. Proprietary Loan Program. In order to provide funding for students who are not able to fully finance the cost of their education under traditional governmental financial aid programs, commercial loan programs or other alternative sources we established a private loan program with a national chartered bank in 2008. Under terms of the related agreement, the bank originates loans for our students who meet our specific credit criteria with the related proceeds used exclusively to fund a portion of their tuition. We then purchase all such loans from the bank on a monthly basis and assume all of the related credit risk. The loans bear interest at market rates; however, principal and interest payments are not required until six months after the student completes or withdraws from his or her program. After the deferral period, monthly principal and interest payments are required over the related term of the loan. In substance, we provide the students who participate in this program with extended payment terms for a portion of their tuition and as a result, we account for the underlying transactions in accordance with our tuition revenue recognition policy. However, due to the nature of the program coupled with the extended payment terms required under the student loan agreements, collectability is not reasonably assured. Accordingly, we recognize tuition revenue and loan origination fees financed by the loan and any related interest income required under the loan when such amounts are collected. We will reevaluate this policy on the basis of our historical collection experience under the program and will accelerate recognition of the related revenue if appropriate. All related expenses incurred with the bank or other service providers are expensed as incurred. Since loan collectability is not reasonably assured, the loans and related deferred tuition revenue are presented net and therefore are effectively not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet. Our presentation will be reevaluated when sufficient collection history has been obtained. Allowance for uncollectible accounts. We maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability, failure or refusal of our students to make required payments. We offer a variety of 57 Table of Contents payment plans to help students pay that portion of their education expenses not covered by financial aid programs or alternate fund sources, which are unsecured and not guaranteed. Management analyzes accounts receivable, historical percentages of uncollectible accounts, customer credit worthiness and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts. We use an internal group of collectors, augmented by third party collectors as deemed appropriate, in our collection efforts. Although we believe that our allowance is adequate, if the financial condition of our students deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if we underestimate the allowances required, additional allowances may be necessary, which would result in increased selling, general and administrative expenses in the period such determination is made. Investments. We invest in pre-refunded municipal bonds, which are generally secured by escrowed-to-maturity U.S. Treasury notes. Municipal bonds represent debt obligations issued by states, cities, counties, and other governmental entities, which earn interest that is exempt from federal income taxes. Additionally, we invest in certificates of deposit issued by financial institutions and corporate bonds from large cap industrial and selected financial companies with a minimum credit rating of A. We have the ability and intention to hold our investments until maturity and therefore classify these investments as held-to-maturity, and report them at amortized cost. Investments with an original maturity date of 90 days or less at the time of purchase are classified as cash equivalents and investments with a maturity date greater than one year at the end of the period are classified as non-current. We review our held-to-maturity investments for impairment quarterly to determine if other-than-temporary declines in the carrying value have occurred for any individual investment. Other-than-temporary declines in the value of our held-to-maturity investments are recorded as expense in the period in which the determination is made. We determined that no other-than-temporary declines occurred in our held-to-maturity investments during the years ended September 30, 2010 and 2009. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment, which might result from the deterioration in the operating performance of the acquired business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in the applicable laws or regulations and a variety of other circumstances. Any resulting impairment charge would be recognized as an expense in the period in which impairment is identified. Our goodwill resulted from the acquisition of our motorcycle and marine education business in 1998. We allocated such goodwill, which totaled $20.6 million, to two of our reporting units that provide the related educational programs. We assess our goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates estimated future cash flows for the next five years and an associated terminal value. Key management assumptions included in the cash flow model include future tuition revenues, operating costs, working capital changes, capital expenditures and a discount rate that approximates our weighted average cost of capital. While actual experience will differ from the amounts included in our cash flow model, we do not believe that a related impairment of our goodwill is reasonably possible in the foreseeable future. Self-Insurance. We are self-insured for a number of risks including claims related to employee health care and dental care and workers compensation. The accounting for our self-insured plans involves estimates and judgments to determine our ultimate liability related to reported claims and claims incurred but not reported. We consider our historical experience, severity factors, actuarial analysis and existing stop loss insurance in estimating our ultimate insurance liability. If our insurance claim trends were to differ significantly from our historic claim experience, we would make a corresponding adjustment to our insurance reserves. Income taxes. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and establish a valuation allowance if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowance are included in our statement of operations as a charge or credit to income tax expense. We make assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining our provisions for income taxes, assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws, and the outcome of future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our 58 Table of Contents consolidated financial statements. In addition, actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assessment of recoverable deferred tax assets inaccurate. Contingencies. In the ordinary conduct of the business, we are subject to occasional lawsuits, investigations and claims, including, but not limited to, claims involving students and graduates and routine employment matters. When we are aware of a claim or potential claim, we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure. If it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability for the loss. If the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we disclose the nature of the specific claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible and the amount involved is material. There can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome of any of the lawsuits, investigations or claims pending against us will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Stock-based Compensation. We measure all share-based payments to employees at estimated fair value. We recognize the compensation expense for option grants and restricted stock awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For stock awards with market conditions, we recognize compensation expense over the requisite period. Option exercise prices are based upon the per share closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each option on the date of grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model based on certain valuation assumptions. The risk-free interest rate is based on a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bill with a maturity date approximately equal to the expected life of the option at the grant date. We apply the simplified method for calculating the expected term of the grant which is the weighted mid-point between the vesting date of the grant and the expiration date of the stock option agreement. Our dividend rate has historically been assumed to be zero because we have not historically paid dividends, other than the special cash dividend of $1.50 paid July 16, 2010. We derive our expected volatility using a method that includes an analysis of companies within our industry sector, including UTI, to calculate the annualized historical volatility. Compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards is measured based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. The requisite service period for restricted stock awards is generally the vesting period. Compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that are expected to vest, which we estimate based upon historical forfeitures. In September 2010 and 2009, our Board of Directors approved grants of stock units with vesting of the grant subject to a market condition (market shares). The market condition is based on total shareholder return which is the comparison of the change in our stock price and dividends to the change in stock price and dividends of the companies included in a nationally recognized stock index for the measurement periods included in the grant. On the settlement date for each measurement period, participants will receive shares of our common stock equal to 0% to 200% of the market shares originally granted depending on where our total shareholder return ranks among the companies included in the related index for that measurement period. The fair value of the market shares at grant date for each measurement period was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation which required assumptions for expected volatilities, correlation coefficients, risk-free rates of return, and dividend yields. Expected volatilities were derived using a method that calculates historical volatility over a period equal to the length of the measurement period for UTI and the companies included in the related index. Correlation coefficients were based on the same data used to calculate historical volatilities and were used to model how our stock price moves in relation to the companies included in the related index. We used a risk-free rate of return that is equal to the yield of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bill that is commensurate with each measurement period, and we assumed that any dividends paid were reinvested. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements which are not yet effective is included in Note 4 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements within Part II, Item 8 of this Report. As indicated in Note 4, we do not expect any of the recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material effect on our financial statements. 59 Table of Contents
