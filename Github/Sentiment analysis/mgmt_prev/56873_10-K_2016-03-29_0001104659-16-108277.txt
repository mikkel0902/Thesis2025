ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of The Kroger Co. should be read in conjunction with the Forward-looking Statements section set forth in Part I, the Risk Factors section set forth in Item 1A of Part I and the Outlook section below. O UR B USINESS The Kroger Co. was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902. Kroger is one of the nation largest retailers, as measured by revenue, operating 2,778 supermarket and multi-department stores under a variety of local banner names in 35 states and the District of Columbia. Of these stores, 1,387 have fuel centers. We also operate 784 convenience stores, either directly or through franchisees, 323 fine jewelry stores and an online retailer. We operate 38 food production plants, primarily bakeries and dairies, which supply approximately 40% of the corporate brand units sold in our supermarkets. Our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores. We earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers. Such costs include procurement and distribution costs, facility occupancy and operational costs, and overhead expenses. Our retail operations, which represent over 99% of our consolidated sales and EBITDA, is our only reportable segment. On December 18, 2015, we closed our merger with Roundy by purchasing 100% of the Roundy outstanding common stock for $3.60 per share and assuming Roundy outstanding debt, for a purchase price of $866 million. Roundy is included in our ending Consolidated Balance Sheets for 2015 and in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the last six weeks of 2015. Certain year-over-year comparisons will be affected as a result. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our merger with Roundy s. On August 18, 2014, we closed our merger with Vitacost.com by purchasing 100% of the Vitacost.com outstanding common stock for $8.00 per share or $287 million. Vitacost.com is included in our ending Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2014 and 2015. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our merger with Vitacost.com. On January 28, 2014, we closed our merger with Harris Teeter by purchasing 100% of the Harris Teeter outstanding common stock for approximately $2.4 billion. Harris Teeter is included in our ending Consolidated Balance Sheets for 2014 and 2015 and in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2014 and 2015. Due to the timing of the merger closing late in fiscal year 2013, its results of operations were not material to our consolidated results of operations for 2013. Certain year-over-year comparisons will be affected as a result. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our merger with Harris Teeter. O UR 2015 P ERFORMANCE We achieved outstanding results in 2015. Our business strategy continues to resonate with a full range of customers and our results reflect the balance we seek to achieve across our business including positive identical supermarket sales growth, increases in loyal household count, and good cost control, as well as growth in net earnings and net earnings per diluted share. Our 2015 net earnings were $2.0 billion or $2.06 per diluted share, compared to $1.7 billion, or $1.72 per diluted share for 2014. All share and per share amounts presented are reflective of the two-for-one stock split that began trading at the split adjusted price on July 14, 2015. Our net earnings for 2015 include a $110 million expense to operating, general, and administrative ( OG&A ) for certain contributions to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union ( UFCW ) Consolidated Pension Plan ( 2015 UFCW Contributions ) made during the third and fourth quarters of 2015. In addition, our net earnings for 2015 include a lower last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) charge compared to 2014. Net earnings for 2014 include a net $39 million after-tax charge for an $87 million ($56 million after-tax) charge to OG&A due to the commitments and withdrawal liabilities arising from restructuring of certain multi-employer obligations ( 2014 Multi-Employer Pension Plan Obligation ) to help stabilize associates future pension benefits, offset partially by the benefits from certain tax items of $17 million ( 2014 Adjusted Items ). In addition, our net earnings for 2014 include unusually high fuel margins, partially offset by a LIFO charge that was significantly higher than 2013 and $140 million in 12 contributions charged to OG&A expenses for the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan ($55 million) and The Kroger Co. Foundation ($85 million) ( 2014 Contributions ). The 2015 and 2014 contributions to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan was to further fund the plan. The $85 million contribution, in 2014, to The Kroger Co. Foundation will enable it to continue to support causes such as hunger relief, breast cancer awareness, the military and their families and local community organizations. Fuel margin per gallon was $0.19 in 2014, compared to $0.14 in 2013. Our net earnings for 2013 include a net benefit of $23 million, which includes benefits from certain tax items of $40 million, offset partially by costs of $11 million in interest and $16 million in OG&A expenses ($17 million after-tax) related to our merger with Harris Teeter ( 2013 Adjusted Items ). Our 2015 net earnings were $2.0 billion or $2.06 per diluted share, compared to $1.7 billion, or $1.72 per diluted share for 2014. Net earnings for 2015 totaled $2.0 billion, or $2.06 per diluted share, compared to net earnings in 2014 of $1.8 billion, or $1.76 per diluted share, excluding the 2014 Adjusted Items. We believe adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share present a more accurate year-over-year comparison of our financial results because the 2014 Adjusted Items were not the result of our normal operations. Our net earnings per diluted share for 2015 represent a 17% increase, compared to 2014 adjusted net earnings per diluted share. Please refer to the Net Earnings section of MD&A for more information. Our identical supermarket sales increased 5.0%, excluding fuel, in 2015, compared to 2014. We have achieved 49 consecutive quarters of positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel. As we continue to outpace many of our competitors on identical supermarket sales growth, we continue to gain market share. We focus on identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, as it is a key performance target for our long-term growth strategy. Increasing market share is an important part of our long-term strategy as it best reflects how our products and services resonate with customers. Market share growth allows us to spread the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base. Our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share by offering customers good prices and superior products and service. Based on Nielsen POS+ data, our overall market share of the products we sell in markets in which we operate increased by approximately 40 basis points in 2015. This data also indicates that our market share increased in 17 markets and declined in one. These market share results reflect our long-term strategy of market share growth. R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS The following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2015 compared to 2014 and for 2014 compared to 2013. Comparability is affected by income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods, our merger with Roundy in late 2015 and our merger with Harris Teeter in late 2013. All share and per share amounts presented below are reflective of the two-for-one stock split that began trading at the split adjusted price on July 14, 2015. Management believes adjusted net earnings (and adjusted net earnings per diluted share) are useful metrics to investors and analysts because they more accurately reflect our day-to-day business operations than do the generally accepted accounting principle ( GAAP ) measures of net earnings and net earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings (and adjusted net earnings per diluted share) are non-generally accepted accounting principle ( non-GAAP ) financial measures and should not be considered alternatives to net earnings (and net earnings per diluted share) or any other GAAP measure of performance. Adjusted net earnings (and adjusted net earnings per diluted share) should not be viewed in isolation or considered substitutes for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Management uses adjusted net earnings (and adjusted net earnings per diluted share) in evaluating our results of operations as it believes these measures are more meaningful indicators of operating performance since, as adjusted, those earnings relate more directly to our day-to-day operations. Management also uses adjusted net earnings (and adjusted net earnings per diluted share) as a performance metric for management incentive programs, and to measure our progress against internal budgets and targets. Net Earnings Net earnings totaled $2.0 billion in 2015, $1.7 billion in 2014 and $1.5 billion in 2013. Net earnings improved in 2015, compared to net earnings in 2014, due to an increase in operating profit, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense. Operating profit increased in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) non-fuel operating profit, lower charges for total contributions to The Kroger Co. Foundation, UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan, the charge related to the 2014 Multi-Employer Pension Plan Obligation and a lower LIFO charge which was $28 million (pre-tax), compared to a LIFO charge of $147 million (pre-tax) in 2014, partially offset by a decrease in fuel operating profit and continued investments in lower prices for our customers. The decrease in fuel operating profit was primarily due to a decrease in fuel margin per gallon to $0.17 in 2015, compared to $0.19 in 2014, partially offset by an increase in fuel gallons sold. C ontinued investments in lower prices for our customers includes our pharmacy department, which experienced high levels of inflation that were not fully passed on to the customer in 2015 . 13 Net earnings improved in 2014, compared to net earnings in 2013, due to an increase in operating profit, partially offset by increases in interest and income tax expense. Operating profit increased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in FIFO non-fuel operating profit, excluding Harris Teeter, the effect of our merger with Harris Teeter and an increase in fuel operating profit, partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers, the 2014 Contributions, the charge related to the 2014 Multi-Employer Pension Plan Obligation and a higher LIFO charge which was $147 million (pre-tax), compared to a LIFO charge of $52 million (pre-tax) in 2013. The net earnings for 2015 do not include any non-GAAP adjustments. The net earnings for 2014 include a net charge of $39 million, after tax, related to the 2014 Adjusted Items. The net earnings for 2013 include a net benefit of $23 million, after tax, related to the 2013 Adjusted Items. Excluding these benefits and charges for Adjusted Items for 2014 and 2013, adjusted net earnings were $2.0 billion in 2015, $1.8 billion in 2014 and $1.5 billion in 2013. 2015 net earnings improved, compared to adjusted net earnings in 2014, due to an increase in FIFO non-fuel operating profit, lower charges for total contributions to The Kroger Co. Foundation and UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan and a lower LIFO charge which was $28 million (pre-tax), compared to a LIFO charge of $147 million (pre-tax) in 2014 , partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers, a decrease in fuel operating profit and an increase in income tax expense. Continued investments in lower prices for our customers includes our pharmacy department, which experienced high levels of inflation that were not fully passed on to the customer in 2015. 2014 adjusted net earnings improved, compared to adjusted net earnings in 2013, due to an increase in FIFO non-fuel operating profit, excluding Harris Teeter, the effect of our merger with Harris Teeter and an increase in fuel operating profit, partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers, the 2014 Contributions, increases in interest and income tax expense and a higher LIFO charge which was $147 million (pre-tax), compared to a LIFO charge of $52 million (pre-tax) in 2013. Net earnings per diluted share totaled $2.06 in 2015, $1.72 in 2014 and $1.45 in 2013. Net earnings per diluted share in 2015, compared to 2014, increased primarily due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of Kroger common shares and an increase in net earnings. Net earnings per diluted share in 2014, compared to 2013, increased primarily due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of Kroger common shares and an increase in net earnings. There were no adjustment items in 2015, but excluding the 2014 and 2013 Adjusted Items, adjusted net earnings per diluted share totaled $1.76 in 2014 and $1.43 in 2013. Net earnings per diluted share in 2015, compared to adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2014, increased primarily due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of Kroger common shares and an increase in adjusted net earnings. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2014, compared to adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2013, increased primarily due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of Kroger common shares and an increase in adjusted net earnings. The following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. to net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. excluding Adjusted Items for 2014 and 2013 and a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per diluted common share to the net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per diluted common share excluding Adjusted Items for 2014 and 2013. In 2015, we did not have any adjustment items that affect net earnings or net earnings per diluted share. Net Earnings per Diluted Share excluding the Adjusted Items (in millions, except per share amounts) 2015 2014 2013 Net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. $ 2,039 $ 1,728 $ 1,519 2014 Adjusted Items 39 2013 Adjusted Items (23 ) Net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. excluding the adjustment items above $ 2,039 $ 1,767 $ 1,496 Net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per diluted common share $ 2.06 $ 1.72 $ 1.45 2014 Adjusted Items(1) 0.04 2013 Adjusted Items(1) (0.02 ) Net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per diluted common share excluding the adjustment items above $ 2.06 $ 1.76 $ 1.43 Average numbers of common shares used in diluted calculation 980 993 1,040 (1) The amounts presented represent the net earnings per diluted common share effect of each adjusted item. 14 Sales Total Sales (in millions) 2015 Percentage Increase(2) 2014 Percentage Increase(3) 2013 Total supermarket sales without fuel $ 91,310 5.8 % $ 86,281 12.5 % $ 76,666 Fuel sales 14,804 (21.5 )% 18,850 (0.6 )% 18,962 Other sales(1) 3,716 11.5 % 3,334 21.4 % 2,747 Total sales $ 109,830 1.3 % $ 108,465 10.3 % $ 98,375 (1) Other sales primarily relate to sales at convenience stores, excluding fuel; jewelry stores; food production plants to outside customers; variable interest entities; a specialty pharmacy; in-store health clinics; sales on digital coupon services; and online sales by Vitacost.com. (2) This column represents the sales percentage increases in 2015, compared to 2014. (3) This column represents the sales percentage increases in 2014, compared to 2013. Total sales increased in 2015, compared to 2014, by 1.3%. This increase in 2015 total sales, compared to 2014, was primarily due to an increase in identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, of 5.0%. Total sales also increased due to the inclusion of Roundy sales, due to our merger, for the period of December 18, 2015 to January 30, 2016. Identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, for 2015, compared to 2014, increased primarily due to an increase in the number of households shopping with us, an increase in visits per household, changes in product mix and product cost inflation. Total fuel sales decreased in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to a 26.7% decrease in the average retail fuel price, partially offset by an increase in fuel gallons sold of 7.1%. Total sales increased in 2014, compared to 2013, by 10.3%. This increase in 2014 total sales, compared to 2013, was primarily due to our merger with Harris Teeter, which closed on January 28, 2014, and an increase in identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, of 5.2%. Identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel for 2014, compared to 2013, increased primarily due to an increase in the number of households shopping with us, an increase in visits per household and product cost inflation. Total fuel sales decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to a 6.8% decrease in the average retail fuel price, partially offset by an increase in fuel gallons sold of 6.6%. We define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters. Although identical supermarket sales is a relatively standard term, numerous methods exist for calculating identical supermarket sales growth. As a result, the method used by our management to calculate identical supermarket sales may differ from methods other companies use to calculate identical supermarket sales. We urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate identical supermarket sales before comparing our identical supermarket sales to those of other such companies. Fuel discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in-store purchases are included in all of the supermarket identical sales results calculations illustrated below and reduce our identical supermarket sales results. Differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage. Identical supermarket sales include sales from all departments at identical Fred Meyer multi-department stores and include Roundy sales for the last six weeks of fiscal 2015 for stores that are identical as if they were part of the Company in the prior year. We calculate annualized identical supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of identical supermarket sales. Our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below. Identical Supermarket Sales (dollars in millions) 2015 2014 Including supermarket fuel centers $ 98,916 $ 97,813 Excluding supermarket fuel centers $ 87,553 $ 83,349 Including supermarket fuel centers 1.1 % 4.2 % Excluding supermarket fuel centers 5.0 % 5.2 % 15 Gross Margin and FIFO Gross Margin We calculate gross margin as sales less merchandise costs, including advertising, warehousing, and transportation expenses. Merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses. Our gross margin rates, as a percentage of sales, were 22.16% in 2015, 21.16% in 2014 and 20.57% in 2013. The increase in 2015, compared to 2014, resulted primarily from a decrease in retail fuel sales and reductions in transportation costs and a decrease in our LIFO charge, as a percentage of sales, partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink costs, as a percentage of sales. The increase in 2014, compared to 2013, resulted primarily from the effect of our merger with Harris Teeter, an increase in fuel gross margin rate and a reduction in warehouse and transportation costs, as a percentage of sales, partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and an increase in our LIFO charge, as a percentage of sales. The merger with Harris Teeter, which closed late in fiscal year 2013, had a positive effect on our gross margin rate in 2014 since Harris Teeter has a higher gross margin rate as compared to total Company without Harris Teeter. The increase in fuel gross margin rate for 2014, compared to 2013, resulted primarily from an increase in fuel margin per gallon sold of $0.19 in 2014, compared to $0.14 in 2013. Our retail fuel operations lower our gross margin rate, as a percentage of sales, due to the very low gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to non-fuel sales. A lower growth rate in retail fuel sales, as compared to the growth rate for the total Company, increases the gross margin rates, as a percentage of sales, when compared to the prior year. We calculate FIFO gross margin as sales less merchandise costs, including advertising, warehousing, and transportation expenses, but excluding the LIFO charge. Merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses. Our LIFO charge was $28 million in 2015, $147 million in 2014 and $52 million in 2013. FIFO gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin or any other GAAP measure of performance. FIFO gross margin should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. FIFO gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness. Management believes FIFO gross margin is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our day-to-day merchandising and operational effectiveness. Our FIFO gross margin rates, as a percentage of sales, were 22.18% in 2015, 21.30% in 2014 and 20.62% in 2013. Our retail fuel operations lower our FIFO gross margin rate, as a percentage of sales, due to the very low FIFO gross margin rate on retail fuel as compared to non-fuel sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, our FIFO gross margin rate decreased four basis points in 2015, as a percentage of sales, compared to 2014. The decrease in FIFO gross margin rates, excluding retail fuel, in 2015, compared to 2014, resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers and increased shrink costs, partially offset by a reduction in transportation costs, as a percentage of sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel, our FIFO gross margin rate decreased three basis points in 2014, as a percentage of sales, compared to 2013. The decrease in FIFO gross margin rates, excluding retail fuel, in 2014, compared to 2013, resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers, offset partially by the effect of our merger with Harris Teeter and a reduction of warehouse and transportation costs, as a percentage of sales. LIFO Charge The LIFO charge was $28 million in 2015, $147 million in 2014 and $52 million in 2013. In 2015, we experienced lower product cost inflation, compared to 2014, which resulted in a lower LIFO charge. In 2015, our LIFO charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to pharmacy, and was partially offset by annualized product cost deflation related to meat and dairy. In 2014, we experienced higher product cost inflation, compared to 2013, which resulted in a higher LIFO charge. In 2014, our LIFO charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to pharmacy, grocery, deli, meat and seafood. In 2013, our LIFO charge resulted primarily from an annualized product cost inflation related to meat, seafood and pharmacy. Operating, General and Administrative Expenses OG&A expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs such as wages, health care benefits and retirement plan costs, utilities and credit card fees. Rent expense, depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in OG&A. OG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 16.34% in 2015, 15.82% in 2014 and 15.45% in 2013. The increase in OG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, in 2015, compared to 2014, resulted primarily from a decrease in retail fuel sales, increases in EMV chargebacks, company sponsored pension, healthcare and incentive plan costs, as a percentage of sales, partially offset by increased supermarket sales, the 2014 Multi-Employer Pension Plan Obligation, lower charges for total contributions to The Kroger Foundation 16 and UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan, productivity improvements and effective cost controls at the store level . The increase in OG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, in 2014, compared to 2013, resulted primarily from the 2014 Contributions, the 2014 Multi-Employer Pension Plan Obligation, the effect of fuel, the effect of our merger with Harris Teeter and increases in credit card fees and incentive plan costs, as a percentage of sales, partially offset by increased supermarket sales growth, productivity improvements and effective cost controls at the store level. Retail fuel sales lower our OG&A rate due to the very low OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales, of retail fuel sales compared to non-fuel sales. The merger with Harris Teeter, which closed late in fiscal year 2013, increased our OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales, since Harris Teeter has a higher OG&A rate as compared to the total Company without Harris Teeter. Our retail fuel operations reduce our overall OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales, due to the very low OG&A rate on retail fuel sales as compared to non-fuel sales. OG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales excluding fuel, the 2015 UFCW Contributions, the 2014 Contributions and the 2014 Multi-Employer Pension Plan Obligation, decreased 9 basis points, compared to 2014. The decrease in our adjusted OG&A rate in 2015, compared to 2014, resulted primarily from increased supermarket sales, productivity improvements and effective cost controls at the store level, partially offset by increases in EMV chargebacks , company sponsored pension, healthcare and incentive plan costs, as a percentage of sales. OG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales excluding fuel, the 2014 Contributions and the 2014 Multi-Employer Pension Plan Obligation, decreased 19 basis points in 2014, compared to 2013, adjusted for the 2013 Adjusted Items. The decrease in our adjusted OG&A rate in 2014, compared to 2013, resulted primarily from increased supermarket sales growth, productivity improvements and effective cost controls at the store level, offset partially by the effect of our merger with Harris Teeter and increases in credit card fees and incentive plan costs, as a percentage of sales. Rent Expense Rent expense was $723 million in 2015, compared to $707 million in 2014 and $613 million in 2013. Rent expense, as a percentage of sales, was 0.66% in 2015, compared to 0.65% in 2014 and 0.62% in 2013. Rent expense increased in 2015, compared to 2014, due to the effect of our merger with Roundy s, partially offset by our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing, whenever possible. Rent expense, as a percentage of sales, in 2015 was consistent with 2014 due to the effect of our merger with Roundy s, partially offset by our continued emphasis to own rather than lease, whenever possible, and the benefit of increased sales. The increase in rent expense, as a percentage of sales, in 2014, compared to 2013, is due to the effect of our merger with Harris Teeter, partially offset by our continued emphasis to own rather than lease, whenever possible, and the benefit of increased sales. The merger with Harris Teeter, which closed late in fiscal year 2013, increased rent expense, as a percentage of sales, since Harris Teeter has a higher rent expense rate compared to the total Company without Harris Teeter. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense was $2.1 billion, compared to $1.9 billion in 2014 and $1.7 billion in 2013. Depreciation and amortization expense, as a percentage of sales, was 1.90% in 2015, 1.80% in 2014 and 1.73% in 2013. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for 2015, compared to 2014, was the result of additional depreciation due to our merger with Roundy and on capital investments, including mergers and lease buyouts, of $3.4 billion, excluding Roundy s. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense, as a percentage of sales, from 2015, compared to 2014, is primarily due to the additional depreciation resulting from our increased capital investments, including mergers and lease buyouts in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for 2014, compared to 2013, in total dollars, was due to the effect of our merger with Harris Teeter and our increased spending in capital investments, including mergers and lease buyouts, of $3.1 billion in 2014. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense, as a percentage of sales, from 2014, compared to 2013, is primarily due to the effect of our merger with Harris Teeter and our increased spending in capital investments, partially offset by increased supermarket sales. The merger with Harris Teeter, which closed late in fiscal year 2013, increased our depreciation and amortization expense, as a percentage of sales, since Harris Teeter has a higher depreciation expense rate as compared to the total Company without Harris Teeter. Operating Profit and Adjusted FIFO Operating Profit Operating profit was $3.6 billion in 2015, $3.1 billion in 2014 and $2.7 billion in 2013. Operating profit, as a percentage of sales, was 3.26% in 2015, 2.89% in 2014 and 2.77% in 2013. Operating profit, as a percentage of sales, increased 37 basis points in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily from increased supermarket sales, a LIFO charge that was significantly lower in 2015, lower charges for total contributions to The Kroger Co. Foundation and UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan, the 2014 Multi-Employer Pension Obligation, productivity improvements, effective cost controls at the store level, and reductions in transportation costs, as a percentage of sales, partially offset by the effect of our merger with Roundy s, continued investments in lower prices for our customers, a decrease in operating profit from our fuel operations, an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and increases in EMV 17 chargebacks, company sponsored pension, healthcare, incentive plan and shrink costs, as a percentage of sales. The decrease in operating profit from our fuel operations for 2015, compared to 2014, resulted primarily from a decrease in the average margin per gallon of fuel sold, partially offset by an increase in fuel gallons sold . Operating profit, as a percentage of sales, increased 12 basis points in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily from the effect of our merger with Harris Teeter, an increase in fuel gross margin rate and a reduction in warehouse and transportation costs, rent and depreciation and amortization expenses, as a percentage of sales, partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and an increase in the LIFO charge, as a percentage of sales. We calculate FIFO operating profit as operating profit excluding the LIFO charge. FIFO operating profit is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit or any other GAAP measure of performance. FIFO operating profit should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. FIFO operating profit is an important measure used by management to evaluate operational effectiveness. Management believes FIFO operating profit is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our day-to-day merchandising and operational effectiveness. Since fuel discounts are earned based on in-store purchases, fuel operating profit does not include fuel discounts, which are allocated to our in-store supermarket location departments. We also derive OG&A, rent and depreciation and amortization expenses through the use of estimated allocations in the calculation of fuel operating profit. FIFO operating profit was $3.6 billion in 2015, $3.3 billion in 2014 and $2.8 billion in 2013. FIFO operating profit, as a percentage of sales, was 3.28% in 2015, 3.03% in 2014 and 2.82% in 2013. FIFO operating profit, excluding the 2015 UFCW Contributions, the 2014 Contributions, the 2014 Multi-Employer Pension Plan Obligation and 2013 Adjusted Items, was $3.7 billion in 2015, $3.5 billion in 2014 and $2.8 billion in 2013. FIFO operating profit, as a percentage of sales excluding the 2015 UFCW Contributions, the 2014 Contributions, the 2014 Multi-Employer Pension Plan Obligation and 2013 Adjusted Items, was 3.38% in 2015, 3.24% in 2014 and 2.84% in 2013. Retail fuel sales lower our overall FIFO operating profit rate due to the very low FIFO operating profit rate, as a percentage of sales, of retail fuel sales compared to non-fuel sales. FIFO operating profit, as a percentage of sales excluding fuel, the 2015 UFCW Contributions, the 2014 Contributions and the 2014 Multi-Employer Pension Plan Obligation, increased 5 basis points in 2015, compared to 2014. The increase in our adjusted FIFO operating profit rate in 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily due to increased supermarket sales, productivity improvements, effective cost controls at the store level and reductions in transportation costs, as a percentage of sales, partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers, the effect of our merger with Roundy s, an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and increases in EMV chargebacks, company sponsored pension, healthcare, incentive plan and shrink costs, as a percentage of sales. Excluding the effects of our merger with Roundy s, FIFO operating profit increased 8 basis points in 2015, compared to 2014. FIFO operating profit, as a percentage of sales, excluding fuel, the 2014 Contributions and the 2014 Multi-Employer Pension Plan Obligation, increased 10 basis points in 2014, compared to 2013, adjusted for the 2013 Adjusted Items. The increase in our adjusted FIFO operating profit rate in 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily due to the effect of our merger with Harris Teeter and a reduction in warehouse and transportation costs, improvements in OG&A, rent and depreciation and amortization expense, as a percentage of sales, partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $482 million in 2015, $488 million in 2014 and $443 million in 2013. The decrease in interest expense in 2015, compared to 2014, resulted primarily due to the timing of debt principal payments and debt issuances, partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with our commercial paper program. The increase in interest expense in 2014, compared to 2013, resulted primarily from an increase in net total debt, primarily due to financing the merger with Harris Teeter and repurchases of our outstanding common shares. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 33.8% in 2015, 34.1% in 2014 and 32.9% in 2013. The 2015, 2014 and 2013 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the utilization of tax credits, the Domestic Manufacturing Deduction and other changes, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes. C OMMON S HARE R EPURCHASE P ROGRAMS We maintain share repurchase programs that comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares, from time to time. We made open market purchases of our common shares totaling $500 million in 2015, $1.1 billion in 2014 and $338 million in 2013 under these repurchase programs. In addition to these repurchase 18 programs, we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans. This program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises, and the tax benefit from these exercises. We repurchased approximately $203 million in 2015, $155 million in 2014 and $271 million in 2013 of our common shares under the stock option program. The shares repurchased in 2015 were acquired under two separate share repurchase programs. The first is a $500 million repurchase program that was authorized by our Board of Directors on June 26, 2014. The second is a program that uses the cash proceeds from the exercises of stock options by participants in our stock option and long-term incentive plans as well as the associated tax benefits. On June 25, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a new $500 million share repurchase program to replace our prior authorization, which had been exhausted. As of January 30, 2016, we have not repurchased any shares utilizing the June 25, 2015 repurchase program. On March 10, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a new $500 million share repurchase program to supplement the 2015 Repurchase Program, which is expected to be exhausted by the end of the second quarter of 2016. C APITAL I NVESTMENTS Capital investments, including changes in construction-in-progress payables and excluding mergers and the purchase of leased facilities, totaled $3.3 billion in 2015, $2.8 billion in 2014 and $2.3 billion in 2013. Capital investments for mergers totaled $168 million in 2015, $252 million in 2014 and $2.3 billion in 2013. Payments for mergers of $168 million in 2015, $252 million in 2014 and $2.3 billion in 2013 relate to our mergers with Roundy s, Vitacost.com and Harris Teeter, respectively. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the mergers with Roundy s, Vitacost.com and Harris Teeter. Capital investments for the purchase of leased facilities totaled $35 million in 2015, $135 million in 2014 and $108 million in 2013. The table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage: Supermarket Storing Activity 2015 2014 2013 Beginning of year 2,625 2,640 2,424 Opened 31 33 17 Opened (relocation) 12 13 7 Acquired 159 227 Closed (operational) (37 ) (48 ) (28 ) Closed (relocation) (12 ) (13 ) (7 ) End of year 2,778 2,625 2,640 Total food store square footage (in millions) 173 162 161 R ETURN ON I NVESTED C APITAL We calculate return on invested capital ( ROIC ) by dividing adjusted operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital. Adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit, and adding back our LIFO charge, depreciation and amortization and rent to our U.S. GAAP operating profit of the prior four quarters. Average invested capital is calculated as the sum of (i) the average of our total assets, (ii) the average LIFO reserve, (iii) the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and (iv) a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight; minus (i) the average taxes receivable, (ii) the average trade accounts payable, (iii) the average accrued salaries and wages and (iv) the average other current liabilities, excluding accrued income taxes. Averages are calculated for ROIC by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter, of the last four quarters, and dividing by two. We use a factor of eight for our total rent as we believe this is a common factor used by our investors, analysts and rating agencies. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. ROIC should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. ROIC is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital. Management believes ROIC is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets. Although ROIC is a relatively standard financial term, numerous methods exist for calculating a company ROIC. As a result, the method used by our management to calculate ROIC may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC. We urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROIC before comparing our ROIC to that of such other companies. 19 The following table provides a calculation of ROIC for 2015 and 2014. The 2015 calculation of ROIC excludes the financial position, results and merger costs for the Roundy transaction: January 30, 2016 January 31, 2015 Return on Invested Capital Numerator Operating profit $ 3,576 $ 3,137 LIFO charge 28 147 Depreciation and amortization 2,089 1,948 Rent 723 707 Adjustments for pension plan agreements 87 Other (13 ) Adjusted operating profit $ 6,403 $ 6,026 Denominator Average total assets $ 32,197 $ 29,860 Average taxes receivable(1) (206 ) (19 ) Average LIFO reserve 1,259 1,197 Average accumulated depreciation and amortization 17,441 16,057 Average trade accounts payable (5,390 ) (4,967 ) Average accrued salaries and wages (1,359 ) (1,221 ) Average other current liabilities(2) (3,054 ) (2,780 ) Adjustment for Roundy merger (714 ) Rent x 8 5,784 5,656 Average invested capital $ 45,958 $ 43,783 Return on Invested Capital 13.93 % 13.76 % (1) Taxes receivable were $392 as of January 30, 2016, $20 as of January 31, 2015 and $18 as of February 1, 2014. The increase in taxes receivable as of January 30, 2016, compared to as of January 31, 2015, is due to recently issued tangible property regulations. Refer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. (2) Other current liabilities included accrued income taxes of $5 as of January 31, 2015 and $92 as of February 1, 2014. We did not have any accrued income taxes as of January 30, 2016. Accrued income taxes are removed from other current liabilities in the calculation of average invested capital. 20 C RITICAL A CCOUNTING P OLICIES We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Self-Insurance Costs We primarily are self-insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims. The liabilities represent our best estimate, using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods, of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through January 30, 2016. We establish case reserves for reported claims using case-basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known. For both workers compensation and general liability claims, we have purchased stop-loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis. We are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits. We account for the liabilities for workers compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate. A 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately $2 million. General liability claims are not discounted. The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs. Our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities. Impairments of Long-Lived Assets We monitor the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred. These events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset. When a triggering event occurs, we perform an impairment calculation, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows, utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores, to the carrying value for those stores. If we identify impairment for long-lived assets to be held and used, we compare the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value. Fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows. We record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value. With respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal, we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. We recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value, reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal. We recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling $46 million in 2015, $37 million in 2014 and $39 million in 2013. We record costs to reduce the carrying value of long-lived assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as Operating, general and administrative expense. The factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation, the economy and market competition. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing long-lived assets for impairment at a different level, could produce significantly different results. 21 Goodwill Our goodwill totaled $2.7 billion as of January 30, 2016. We review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, and also upon the occurrence of triggering events. We perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities (collectively, reporting units ) that have goodwill balances. Fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings, or discounted projected future cash flows, and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment. We base projected future cash flows on management knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future. If we identify potential for impairment, we measure the fair value of a reporting unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. We recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value. In 2015, goodwill increased $420 million primarily due to our merger with Roundy s. In 2014, goodwill increased $169 million primarily due to our merger with Vitacost.com. For additional information related to the allocation of the purchase price for Roundy and Vitacost.com, refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The annual evaluation of goodwill performed for our other reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2015, 2014 and 2013 did not result in impairment. Based on current and future expected cash flows, we believe goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely. A 10% reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance. For additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2015, 2014 and 2013 see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative estimates and assumptions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level, could produce significantly different results. The cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation, business valuations in the market, the economy and market competition. Store Closing Costs We provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining non-cancellable lease payments after the closing date, net of estimated subtenant income. We estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores. We usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores, which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years. Adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates. We make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known. We review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs is adjusted to earnings in the proper period. We estimate subtenant income, future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. The ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets, inflation rates and general economic conditions. We reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value. We account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property, equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of long-lived assets. We classify inventory write-downs in connection with store closings, if any, in Merchandise costs. We expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans We account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of GAAP, which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We record, as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ), actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized. 22 The determination of our obligation and expense for Company-sponsored pension plans and other post-retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts. Those assumptions are described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, mortality and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions, including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets, may materially affect our pension and other post-retirement obligations and our future expense. Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the effect of a 1% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post-retirement benefit costs and the related liability. The objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. In making this determination, we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans. Our methodology for selecting the discount rates was to match the plan cash flows to that of a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the plan projected benefit cash flows. The discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows. The selection of the 4.62% and 4.44% discount rates as of year-end 2015 for pension and other benefits, respectively, represents the hypothetical bond portfolio using bonds with an AA or better rating constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant. We utilized a discount rate of 3.87% and 3.74% as of year-end 2014 for pension and other benefits, respectively. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of January 30, 2016, by approximately $438 million. To determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets held by Kroger for 2015, we considered current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories. In 2015, our assumed pension plan investment return rate was 7.44%, compared to 7.44% in 2014 and 8.50 in 2013. Our pension plans average rate of return was 6.47% for the 10 calendar years ended December 31, 2015, net of all investment management fees and expenses. The value of all investments in our Company-sponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending December 31, 2015, net of investment management fees and expenses, decreased 0.80%. For the past 20 years, our average annual rate of return has been 7.99%. Based on the above information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations, we believe a 7.44% rate of return assumption is reasonable for 2015. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets. On January 31, 2015, we adopted new mortality tables, including industry-based tables for annuitants, reflecting more current mortality experience and assumptions for future generational mortality improvement in calculating our projected benefit obligations as of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 and our 2015 pension expense. The tables assume an improvement in life expectancy and increased our benefit obligation and future expenses. We used the RP-2000 projected to 2021 mortality table in calculating our 2013 year end pension obligation and 2014 and 2013 pension expense. Sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of Kroger pension plan liabilities is illustrated below (in millions). Percentage Point Change Projected Benefit Obligation Decrease/(Increase) Expense Decrease/(Increase) Discount Rate +/- 1.0% $ 438/(530) $ 36/$(42) Expected Return on Assets +/- 1.0% $ 38/$(38) In 2015, we contributed $5 million to our Company-sponsored defined benefit plans and do not expect to make any contributions to these plans in 2016. In 2014, we did not contribute to our Company-sponsored defined benefit plans and do not expect to make any contributions to this plan in 2015. We did not make a contribution in 2014 and contributed $100 million in 2013 to our Company-sponsored defined benefit pension plans. Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of contributions. We contributed and expensed $196 million in 2015, $177 million in 2014 and $148 million in 2013 to employee 401(k) retirement savings accounts. The increase in 2015, compared to 2014, is due to a higher employee savings rate. The increase in 2014, compared to 2013, is due to the effect of our merger with Harris Teeter. The 401(k) retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the Company based on participant contributions, plan compensation, and length of service. 23 Multi-Employer Pension Plans We contribute to various multi-employer pension plans, including the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan, based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements. We are designated as the named fiduciary of the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan and have sole investment authority over these assets. These multi-employer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. Trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions. The trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans. In 2015, we contributed $190 million to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan. We had previously accrued $60 million of the total contributions at January 31, 2015 and recorded expense for the remaining $130 million at the time of payment in 2015. In 2014, we incurred a charge of $56 million (after-tax) related to commitments and withdrawal liabilities associated with the restructuring of pension plan agreements, of which $15 million was contributed to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in 2014. As of January 30, 2016, we are not required to contribute to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in 2016. We recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or when commitments are made, in accordance with GAAP. We made cash contributions to these plans of $426 million in 2015, $297 million in 2014 and $228 million in 2013. Based on the most recent information available to us, we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of the multi-employer plans to which we contribute substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits. We have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets, (i.e., the amount of underfunding), as of December 31, 2015. Because we are only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans, we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of our contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing our share of the underfunding. Nonetheless, the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer. As of December 31, 2015, we estimate that our share of the underfunding of multi-employer plans to which we contribute was approximately $2.9 billion, pre-tax, or $1.8 billion, after-tax, which includes Roundy share of underfunding of its multi-employer plans. This represents an increase in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately $1.1 billion, pre-tax, or approximately $680 million, after-tax, as of December 31, 2015, compared to December 31, 2014. The increase in the amount of underfunding is attributable to lower than expected returns on the assets held in the multi-employer plans during 2015, changes in mortality rate assumptions and the merger of Roundy s. Our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data (that include the estimates of others), and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable. We have made and disclosed this estimate not because, except as noted above, this underfunding is a direct liability of ours. Rather, we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences. In 2016, we expect to contribute approximately $260 million to multi-employer pension plans, subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions. We expect increases in expense as a result of increases in multi-employer pension plan contributions over the next few years. Finally, underfunding means that, in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds, we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability. Any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with GAAP. The amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations, returns on the assets held in the multi-employer plans and benefit payments. The amount could decline, and our future expense would be favorably affected, if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or favorable legislation. On the other hand, our share of the underfunding could increase and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline, if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or adverse legislation. We continue to evaluate our potential exposure to under-funded multi-employer pension plans. Although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of ours, any commitments to fund certain multi-employer plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information relating to our participation in these multi-employer pension plans. Uncertain Tax Positions We review the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other disclosures related to uncertain tax positions. 24 Various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions, including state and local taxes, we record allowances for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which an allowance has been established, is audited and fully resolved. As of January 30, 2016, the Internal Revenue Service had concluded its examination of our 2010 and 2011 federal tax returns. Tax years 2012 and 2013 remain under examination. The assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Share-Based Compensation Expense We account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of GAAP. Under this method, we recognize compensation expense for all share-based payments granted. We recognize share-based compensation expense, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, over the requisite service period of the award. In addition, we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award, over the period the award restrictions lapse. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally on a LIFO basis) or market. In total, approximately 95% of inventories in 2015 and 2014 were valued using the LIFO method. Cost for the balance of the inventories, including substantially all fuel inventories, was determined using the FIFO method. Replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by $1.3 billion at January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015. We follow the Link-Chain, Dollar-Value LIFO method for purposes of calculating our LIFO charge or credit. We follow the item-cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the LIFO adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions. This method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances and cash discounts) of each item and recording the cost of items sold. T he item-cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory. In addition, substantially all of our inventory consists of finished goods and is recorded at actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances and cash discounts). We evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities. We record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date. Vendor Allowances We recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold. In most cases, vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item, and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item. When it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item, we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold. We recognized approximately $7.3 billion in 2015, $6.9 billion in 2014 and $6.2 billion in 2013 of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs. We recognized approximately 91% of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns. 25 R ECENTLY A DOPTED A CCOUNTING S TANDARDS In 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) amended Accounting Standards Codification 835, Interest-Imputation of Interest. The amendment simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability by requiring it be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This amendment became effective beginning February 1, 2015, and was adopted retrospectively in accordance with the standard. The adoption of this amendment resulted in amounts previously reported in other assets to now be reported within long-term debt including obligations under capital leases and financing obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts were not material to the prior year. The adoption of this amendment did not have an effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. R ECENTLY I SSUED A CCOUNTING S TANDARDS In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides guidance for revenue recognition. The standard core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Per ASU 2015-14, Deferral of Effective Date, this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending February 2, 2019. Early adoption is permitted as of the first quarter of our fiscal year ending February 3, 2018. We are currently in the process of evaluating the effect of adoption of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-04, Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets. This amendment permits an entity to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month end that is closest to the entity fiscal year end for all plans. This guidance will be effective for us in the fiscal year ending January 28, 2017. The implementation of this amendment will not have an effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and will not have a significant effect on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent). This amendment removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share. This guidance will be effective for us in the fiscal year ending January 28, 2017. The implementation of this amendment will have an effect on our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and will not have an effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations or Consolidated Balance Sheets. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. This amendment eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. This guidance will be effective for us in the fiscal year ending January 28, 2017. The implementation of this amendment is not expected to have a significant effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This amendment requires deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance will be effective for our fiscal year ending January 28, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The implementation of this amendment will not have an effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and will not have a significant effect on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases , which provides guidance for the recognition of lease agreements. The standard core principle is that a company will now recognize most leases on its balance sheet as lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year ending February 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this ASU will result in a significant increase to our Consolidated Balance Sheets for lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, and we are currently evaluating the other effects of adoption of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe our current off-balance sheet leasing commitments are reflected in our investment grade debt rating. 26 L IQUIDITY AND C APITAL R ESOURCES Cash Flow Information Net cash provided by operating activities We generated $4.8 billion of cash from operations in 2015, compared to $4.2 billion in 2014 and $3.6 billion in 2013. The cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including non-controlling interests adjusted primarily for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization, stock compensation, expense for Company-sponsored pension plans, the LIFO charge and changes in working capital. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015, compared to 2014, resulted primarily due to an increase in net earnings including non-controlling interests, an increase in non-cash items and changes in working capital. The increase in non-cash items in 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization expense and expense for Company-sponsored pension plans, partially offset by a lower LIFO charge. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2014, compared to 2013, resulted primarily due to an increase in net earnings including non-controlling interests, which include the results of Harris Teeter, an increase in non-cash items, a reduction in contributions to Company-sponsored pension plans and changes in working capital. The increase in non-cash items in 2014, as compared to 2013, was primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization expense and the LIFO charge. The amount of cash paid for income taxes increased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in net earnings including non-controlling interests. Cash provided (used) by operating activities for changes in working capital was $96 million in 2015, compared to ($49) million in 2014 and $63 million in 2013. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for changes in working capital in 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by trade accounts payables and store deposits in transit, partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by income taxes receivable and payable. The increase in cash used by operating activities for changes in working capital in 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily due to an increase in cash used for receivables and a decrease in cash provided by trade accounts payables, partially offset by an increase in cash provided by accrued expenses. Net cash used by investing activities Cash used by investing activities was $3.6 billion in 2015, compared to $3.1 billion in 2014 and $4.8 billion in 2013. The amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2015, compared to 2014, due to increased payments for capital investments, partially offset by lower payments for mergers. The amount of cash used by investing activities decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, due to decreased payments for mergers, offset primarily by increased payments for capital investments. Capital investments, including payments for lease buyouts, but excluding mergers, were $3.3 billion in 2015, $2.8 billion in 2014 and $2.3 billion in 2013. Merger payments were $168 million in 2015, $252 million in 2014 and $2.3 billion in 2013. Merger payments decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to our merger with Harris Teeter in 2013. Refer to the Capital Investments section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years. Net cash provided (used) by financing activities Financing activities (used) provided cash of ($1.3) billion in 2015, ($1.2) billion in 2014 and $1.4 billion in 2013. The increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily related to increased payments on long-term debt and commercial paper, partially offset by higher proceeds from issuances of long-term debt and decreased treasury stock purchases. The increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily related to decreased proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and increased treasury stock purchases, offset partially by decreased payments on long-term debt. Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt were $1.2 billion in 2015, $576 million in 2014 and $3.5 billion in 2013. Net (payments) borrowings provided from our commercial paper program were ($285) million in 2015, $25 million in 2014 and ($395) million in 2013. Please refer to the Debt Management section of MD&A for additional information. We repurchased $703 million of Kroger common shares in 2015, compared to $1.3 billion in 2014 and $609 million in 2013. We paid dividends totaling $385 million in 2015, $338 million in 2014 and $319 million in 2013. 27 Debt Management Total debt, including both the current and long-term portions of capital lease and lease-financing obligations, increased $481 million to $12.1 billion as of year-end 2015, compared to 2014. The increase in 2015, compared to 2014, resulted primarily from the issuance of (i) $300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 2.00%, (ii) $300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 2.60%, (iii) $500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 3.50% and (iv) an increase in capital lease obligations due to our merger with Roundy and various leased locations, partially offset by payments of $678 million on long-term debt obligations assumed as part of our merger with Roundy and $500 million of payments at maturity of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 3.90%. The increase in financing obligations was due to partially funding our merger with Roundy s. Total debt, including both the current and long-term portions of capital lease and lease-financing obligations increased $346 million to $11.7 billion as of year-end 2014, compared to 2013. The increase in 2014, compared to 2013, resulted primarily from (i) the issuance of $500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 2.95% and (ii) an increase in commercial paper of $25 million, partially offset by payments at maturity of $300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 4.95%. The increase in financing obligations was due to partially funding our outstanding common share repurchases. Liquidity Needs We estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelve-month period to range from $6.6 to $6.9 billion, which includes anticipated requirements for working capital, capital investments, interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper, offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of 2015. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and because we have consistent access to the capital markets. Based on current operating trends, we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility, will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months. We have approximately $990 million of commercial paper and $1.3 billion of senior notes maturing in the next twelve months, which is included in the range of $6.6 to $6.9 billion in estimated liquidity needs. We expect to refinance this debt, in 2016, by issuing additional senior notes or commercial paper on favorable terms based on our past experience. We also currently plan to continue repurchases of common shares under the Company share repurchase programs. We believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions. Factors Affecting Liquidity We can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately $2.75 billion under our commercial paper ( CP ) program. At January 30, 2016, we had $990 million of CP borrowings outstanding. CP borrowings are backed by our credit facility, and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility. If our short-term credit ratings fall, the ability to borrow under our current CP program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our CP program. This could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility, under which we believe we have sufficient capacity. However, in the event of a ratings decline, we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our CP program would be any lower than $500 million on a daily basis. Although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating, the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by an increase in our Leverage Ratio. As of March 23, 2016, we had $1.1 billion of CP borrowings outstanding. The increase as of March 23, 2016, compared to year-end 2015, was due to partially funding our outstanding common share repurchases. Our credit facility requires the maintenance of a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (our financial covenants ). A failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility. These financial covenants and ratios are described below: Our Leverage Ratio (the ratio of Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility) was 1.97 to 1 as of January 30, 2016. If this ratio were to exceed 3.50 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired. In addition, our Applicable Margin on borrowings is determined by our Leverage Ratio. Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA plus Consolidated Rental Expense to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense plus Consolidated Rental Expense, as defined in the credit facility) was 5.30 to 1 as of January 30, 2016. If this ratio fell below 1.70 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired. Our credit agreement is more fully described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We were in compliance with our financial covenants at year-end 2015. 28 The tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments, based on year of maturity or settlement, as of January 30, 2016 (in millions of dollars): 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations (1) (2) Long-term debt(3) $ 2,318 $ 735 $ 1,307 $ 774 $ 724 $ 5,538 $ 11,396 Interest on long-term debt (4) 476 410 375 315 279 2,550 4,405 Capital lease obligations 103 72 62 57 52 527 873 Operating lease obligations 967 922 853 774 674 4,199 8,389 Financed lease obligations 13 13 13 13 13 74 139 Self-insurance liability (5) 223 138 98 63 38 79 639 Construction commitments(6) 418 418 Purchase obligations(7) 532 161 77 58 42 106 976 Total $ 5,050 $ 2,451 $ 2,786 $ 2,054 $ 1,822 $ 13,072 $ 27,235 Other Commercial Commitments Standby letters of credit $ 244 $ $ $ $ $ $ 244 Surety bonds 332 332 Total $ 576 $ $ $ $ $ $ 576 (1) The contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which totaled approximately $30 million in 2015. This table also excludes contributions under various multi-employer pension plans, which totaled $426 million in 2015. (2) The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined. (3) As of January 30, 2016, we had $990 million of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement. (4) Amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of January 30, 2016, and stated fixed and swapped interest rates, if applicable, for all other debt instruments. (5) The amounts included in the contractual obligations table for self-insurance liability related to workers compensation claims have been stated on a present value basis. (6) Amounts include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction. These amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. (7) Amounts include commitments, many of which are short-term in nature, to be utilized in the normal course of business, such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our food production plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and food production plants. Our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties and outside service contracts. Any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 30, 2016, we maintained a $2.75 billion (with the ability to increase by $750 million), unsecured revolving credit facility that, unless extended, terminates on June 30, 2019. Outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings, and some outstanding letters of credit, reduce funds available under the credit agreement. As of January 30, 2016, we had $990 million of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement. The outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled $13 million as of January 30, 2016. In addition to the available credit mentioned above, as of January 30, 2016, we had authorized for issuance $900 million of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC and effective on December 13, 2013. We also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self-insured workers compensation claims. These bonds are required by most states in which we are self-insured for workers compensation and are placed with predominately third-party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our self-insured retention levels. These bonds do not represent liabilities of ours, as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs. Market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and, in some instances, availability of these bonds may become more limited, which 29 could affect our costs of, or access to, such bonds. Although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds, if this does become an issue, we would issue letters of credit, in states where allowed, against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements. This could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility. We also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions. We could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations. Due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties, and various other remedies available to us, we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote. We have agreed to indemnify certain third-party logistics operators for certain expenses, including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities. In addition to the above, we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business. Such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to us; indemnities related to the sale of our securities; indemnities of directors, officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work; and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans. While our aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability, we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability. 30 O UTLOOK This discussion and analysis contains certain forward-looking statements about our future performance. These statements are based on management assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available to it. Such statements are indicated by words such as comfortable, committed, will, expect, goal, should, intend, target, believe, anticipate, plan, and similar words or phrases. These forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations, projections, beliefs, intentions or strategies are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. While we believe that the statements are accurate, uncertainties about the general economy, our labor relations, our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially. The guidance below includes our expectations for Roundy s. We expect net earnings to be $2.19 to $2.28 per diluted share, which is essentially in line with our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% - 11%. Where we fall within the range will be primarily driven by actual fuel margins, which we expect to be at or slightly below the five-year average, with continued volatility. We expect our core business in 2016 to grow in line with our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% 11%. We expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel sales, of 2.5%-3.5% in 2016, reflecting the lower inflationary environment. We expect full-year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to 2015 results. We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be $4.1 to $4.4 billion. These capital investments include approximately 100 major projects covering new stores, expansions and relocations, including 10 Ruler locations; 200 to 220 major remodels; and other investments including minor remodels and technology and infrastructure to support our Customer 1 st business strategy. We expect total supermarket square footage for 2016 to grow approximately 3.0% - 3.5% before mergers, acquisitions and operational closings. We expect 2016 year-end ROIC to increase slightly compared to the 2015 result. We expect the 2016 effective tax rate to be approximately 35%, excluding the resolution of certain tax items. In 2016, we anticipate annualized product cost inflation of 1.0% to 2.0%, excluding fuel, and an annualized LIFO charge of approximately $50 million. We expect inflation to be lower during the earlier portion of 2016 and to gradually rise during the later portion of 2016. We expect 2016 Company-sponsored pension plans expense to be approximately $80 million. We do not expect to make a cash contribution in 2016. In 2016, we expect to contribute approximately $260 million to multi-employer pension funds. We continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to under-funded multi-employer pension plans. Although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of Kroger, any new agreements that would commit us to fund certain multi-employer plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made. In 2016, we will negotiate agreements with UFCW for store associates in Houston, Indianapolis, Little Rock, Nashville, Portland, Southern California and Fry in Arizona. Negotiations this year will be challenging as we must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates needs for solid wages and good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits. 31 Various uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These include: The extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates. Our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit, including our bank credit facilities, could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us, or in the event that natural disasters or weather conditions interfere with the ability of our lenders to lend to us. Our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial markets. Our ability to achieve sales, earnings and cash flow goals may be affected by: labor negotiations or disputes; changes in the types and numbers of businesses that compete with us; pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors, including non-traditional competitors, and the aggressiveness of that competition; our response to these actions; the state of the economy, including interest rates, the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities, and the unemployment rate; the effect that fuel costs have on consumer spending; volatility of fuel margins; changes in government-funded benefit programs; manufacturing commodity costs; diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations; trends in consumer spending; the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing in response to economic conditions; the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery; changes in inflation or deflation in product and operating costs; stock repurchases; our ability to retain pharmacy sales from third party payors; consolidation in the healthcare industry, including pharmacy benefit managers; our ability to negotiate modifications to multi-employer pension plans; natural disasters or adverse weather conditions; the potential costs and risks associated with potential cyber-attacks or data security breaches; the success of our future growth plans; and the successful integration of Harris Teeter and Roundy s. Our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may also be affected by our ability to manage the factors identified above. Our ability to execute our financial strategy may be affected by our ability to generate cash flow. During the first three quarters of each fiscal year, our LIFO charge and the recognition of LIFO expense is affected primarily by estimated year-end changes in product costs. Our fiscal year LIFO charge is affected primarily by changes in product costs at year-end. If actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units including variable interest entities, an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized. Our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws, the status of pending items with various taxing authorities, and the deductibility of certain expenses. Changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators. For example, we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base. Since fuel generates lower profit margins than our supermarket sales, we expect to see our FIFO gross margins decline as fuel sales increase. We cannot fully foresee the effects of changes in economic conditions on Kroger business. We have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly in 2016. Other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking information. Accordingly, actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in, contemplated or implied by forward-looking statements made by us or our representatives. We undertake no obligation to update the forward-looking information contained in this filing. 32
