ITEM 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General Unless the context indicates otherwise, when we refer to we, us, our or the Company in this Form 10 K, we are referring to Guess?, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. COVID-19 Business Update The COVID-19 pandemic, which is ongoing and dynamic in nature, has had and is continuing to have a material impact on the Company financial performance. Since the start of the pandemic, the Company has experienced various temporary retail store closures in key regions globally, including the closure of a significant majority of its stores during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company gradually reopened most of its global fleet of stores. Toward the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company started to incur a new round of government-mandated temporary store closures, mostly in Europe. 29 Table of C ontents While the number of temporarily closed stores ebbed and flowed during the fourth quarter based on local conditions, the overall impact resulted in stores being closed for over 15% of the total days during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As of January 30, 2021, approximately 70% of our stores were open, with the majority of closed stores located primarily in Europe and Canada. As of March 27, 2021, approximately 77% of our stores were open. The Company will continue to reopen stores (and/or close again, if appropriate) as governmental guidelines and local conditions permit or require, taking an informed, measured approach based on numerous factors. The Company e-commerce sites have remained open in all regions throughout the pandemic. In addition to the impact of store closures, retail stores that are open have and continue to experience significant reductions in traffic and revenue. Many of the Company wholesale and licensing partners have also substantially reduced their operations. The Company has brought back furloughed store associates and support staff as stores reopen. The extent and duration of the global pandemic remains uncertain and may continue to impact consumer purchasing activity in the foreseeable future. During fiscal 2021, in addition to the negative impact from lower net revenue, the Company operating results reflected asset impairment charges as well as additional inventory valuation reserves and higher allowances for markdowns and doubtful accounts due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These charges were partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses driven primarily by expense savings, both one-time, such as furloughs and temporary salary reductions, and permanent, such as headcount reductions and lower discretionary spending. In addition, the Company benefited from various government assistance programs related primarily to the recovery of employee payroll costs as well as certain favorable tax treatments. During fiscal 2021, the Company implemented a number of measures to help mitigate the operating and financial impact of the pandemic, including: (i) furloughing its U.S. and Canada store associates and significant portions of its U.S. and Canada corporate and distribution center associates and permanently reducing U.S. corporate headcount; (ii) implementing temporary tiered salary reductions for management level corporate employees, including its executive officers; (iii) deferring annual merit increases; (iv) executing substantial reductions in expenses, store occupancy costs, capital expenditures and overall costs, including reduced inventory purchases; (v) working globally with country management teams to maximize the Company participation in all eligible government or other initiatives available to businesses or employees impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic; (vi) drawing down on certain credit facilities and entering into certain term loans to ensure financial flexibility and maintain maximum liquidity; (vii) engaging with landlords to negotiate rent deferrals or other rent concessions; (viii) working with vendors to extend payment terms; and (ix) postponing its decision related to the payment of its quarterly cash dividend. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, as the situation began to stabilize, the Company repaid a significant portion of its previously drawn down credit facilities, continued to bring back furloughed employees, eliminated the temporary tiered salary reductions and invested in share repurchases to return value to its shareholders. The Company also announced that it would resume paying its quarterly cash dividend beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, but decided to not declare any cash dividends for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2021. Business Segments The Company businesses are grouped into five reportable segments for management and internal financial reporting purposes: Americas Retail, Americas Wholesale, Europe, Asia and Licensing. Management evaluates segment performance based primarily on revenues and earnings (loss) from operations before corporate performance-based compensation costs, asset impairment charges, net gains (losses) from lease modifications, restructuring charges and certain non-recurring credits (charges), if any. The Americas Retail segment includes the Company retail and e-commerce operations in the Americas. The Americas Wholesale segment includes the Company wholesale operations in the Americas. The Europe segment includes the Company retail, e-commerce and wholesale operations in Europe and the Middle East. The Asia segment includes the Company retail, e-commerce and wholesale operations in Asia and the Pacific. The Licensing segment includes the worldwide licensing operations of the Company. The business segment operating results exclude corporate overhead costs, which consist of shared costs of the organization, asset impairment charges, net gains (losses) on lease modifications, restructuring charges and certain non-recurring credits (charges), if any. Corporate overhead costs are presented separately and generally include, among other things, the following unallocated corporate 30 Table of C ontents costs: accounting and finance, executive compensation, corporate performance-based compensation, facilities, global advertising and marketing, human resources, information technology and legal. Information regarding these segments is summarized in Part IV. Financial Statements Note 18 Segment Information in this Form 10-K. Products We derive our net revenue from the sale of GUESS?, G by GUESS (GbG), GUESS Kids and MARCIANO apparel and our licensees products through our worldwide network of directly-operated and licensed retail stores, wholesale customers and distributors, as well as our online sites. During fiscal 2021, we made the decision to integrate our G by GUESS brand into our Factory business in order to drive further efficiencies. We also derive royalty revenue from worldwide licensing activities. Foreign Currency Volatility Since the majority of our international operations are conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, euro, Japanese yen, Korean won, Mexican peso, Polish zloty, Russian rouble and Turkish lira), currency fluctuations can have a significant impact on the translation of our international revenues and earnings (loss) into U.S. dollars. Some of our transactions that occur primarily in Europe, Canada, South Korea, China and Mexico are denominated in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs, British pounds and Russian roubles, exposing them to exchange rate fluctuations when these transactions (such as inventory purchases or periodic lease payments) are converted to their functional currencies. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates can impact the operating margins of our foreign operations and reported earnings (loss), and are largely dependent on the transaction timing and magnitude during the period that the currency fluctuates. In addition, there are certain real estate leases which are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective entity that entered into the agreement (primarily Swiss francs, Russian roubles and Polish zloty). As a result, the Company may be exposed to volatility related to unrealized gains or losses on the translation of present value of future lease payment obligations when translated at the exchange rate as of a reporting period-end. When these foreign exchange rates weaken versus the U.S. dollar at the time the respective U.S. dollar denominated payment is made relative to the payments made in the comparable period, our product margins could be unfavorably impacted. During fiscal 2021, the average U.S. dollar rate was stronger against the Turkish lira, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Polish zloty, Russian rouble, and Korean won, and weaker against the euro, Chinese yuan, British pound and Japanese yen, compared to the average rate in fiscal 2020. This had an overall unfavorable impact on the translation of our international revenues and earnings from operations during fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year. If the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the respective fiscal 2021 foreign exchange rates, foreign exchange could negatively impact our revenues and operating results, as well as our international cash and other balance sheet items during fiscal 2022, particularly in Canada, Europe (primarily the euro, British pound, Turkish lira and Russian rouble) and Mexico. Alternatively, if the U.S. dollar weakens relative to the respective fiscal 2021 foreign exchange rates, our revenues and operating results, as well as our other cash balance sheet items, could be positively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations during fiscal 2022, particularly in these regions. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to offset some but not all of the exchange risk on foreign currency transactions. For additional discussion regarding our exposure to foreign currency risk, forward contracts designated as hedging instruments and forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments, refer to Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Strategy In December 2019, Chief Executive Officer Carlos Alberini shared his strategic vision and implementation plan for execution which included the identification of several key priorities to drive revenue and operating profit growth over the next five years. These priorities, which continue to guide the Company strategic decisions, are: (i) brand relevancy; (ii) product excellence; (iii) customer centricity; (iv) global footprint; and (v) functional capabilities; each as further described below: Brand Relevancy. We plan to optimize our brand architecture to be relevant with our three target consumer groups: Heritage, Millennials, and Generation Z. We will continue to execute celebrity and influencer partnerships 31 Table of C ontents and collaborations, as we believe that they are critical to engage more effectively with a younger and broader audience. Product Excellence. We will extend our product offering to provide our customers with products for the different occasions of their lifestyles. We will seek to better address local product needs. Customer Centricity. We intend to place the customer at the center of everything we do. We plan to implement processes and platforms to provide our customers with a seamless omni-channel experience. Global Footprint. We will continue to expand the reach of our brands by optimizing the productivity and profitability of our current footprint and expanding our distribution channels. Functional Capabilities. We expect to drive material operational improvements in the next four years to leverage and support our global business more effectively, primarily in the areas of logistics, sourcing, product development and production, inventory management, and overall infrastructure. Capital Allocation We plan to continue to prioritize capital allocation toward investments that support growth and infrastructure, while remaining highly disciplined in the way we allocate capital across projects, including new store development, store remodels, technology and logistics investments and others. When we prioritize investments, we will focus on their strategic significance and their return on invested capital expectations. We also plan to manage product buys and inventory ownership rigorously and optimize overall working capital management consistently. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had deferred the decision with respect to the payment of its quarterly cash dividend. The Board of Directors decided to continue to postpone its decision with respect to the payment of its quarterly cash dividend during the second quarter of fiscal 2021, in order to preserve the Company cash position and provide continued financial flexibility in light of uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company announced that it would resume paying its quarterly cash dividend of $0.1125 per share beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, but decided to not declare cash dividends for the first and second quarters of 2021. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company announced that its Board of Directors reduced the future quarterly cash dividends that may be paid to holders of the Company common stock, when, as and if any such dividend is declared by the Company Board of Directors, from $0.225 per share to $0.1125 per share to redeploy capital and return incremental value to shareholders through share repurchases. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company used $170 million of proceeds from its convertible senior notes to enter into an accelerated share repurchase program ( ASR Contract ). The Company also repurchased shares of its common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions totaling $38.9 million and $118.1 million during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Comparable Store Sales Except as described below in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company reports National Retail Federation calendar comparable store sales on a quarterly basis for our retail businesses which include the combined results from our brick-and-mortar retail stores and our e-commerce sites. We also separately report the impact of e-commerce sales on our comparable store sales metric. As a result of our omni-channel strategy, our e-commerce business has become strongly intertwined with our brick-and-mortar retail store business. Therefore, we believe that the inclusion of e-commerce sales in our comparable store sales metric provides a more meaningful representation of our retail results. Sales from our brick-and-mortar retail stores include purchases that are initiated, paid for and fulfilled at our retail stores and directly operated concessions as well as merchandise that is reserved online but paid for and picked-up at our retail stores. Sales from our e-commerce sites include purchases that are initiated and paid for online and shipped from either our distribution centers or our retail stores as well as purchases that are initiated in a retail store, but due to inventory availability at the retail store, are ordered and paid for online and shipped from our distribution centers or picked-up from a different retail store. Store sales are considered comparable after the store has been open for 13 full fiscal months. If a store remodel results in a square footage change of more than 15%, or involves a relocation or a change in store 32 Table of C ontents concept, the store sales are removed from the comparable store base until the store has been opened at its new size, in its new location or under its new concept for 13 full fiscal months. Stores that are permanently closed or temporarily closed for more than seven days in any fiscal month are excluded from the calculation in the fiscal month that they are closed. E-commerce sales are considered comparable after the online site has been operational in a country for 13 full fiscal months and exclude any related revenue from shipping fees. These criteria are consistent with the metric used by management for internal reporting and analysis to measure performance of the store or online sites. Definitions and calculations of comparable store sales used by the Company may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. As a result of significant temporary store closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has not disclosed any comparable store sales measures when discussing the results of operations for fiscal 2021. We believe that comparable store sales measures for fiscal 2021 are not meaningful to the evaluation of the Company results until the impact from the temporary store closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has normalized. Executive Summary Overview Net loss attributable to Guess?, Inc. was $81.2 million, or diluted loss of $1.27 per common share, for fiscal 2021, compared to net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. of $96.0 million, or diluted earnings of $1.33 per common share for fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2021, the Company recognized $80.4 million of asset impairment charges; a net credit of $0.6 million of certain professional service, legal fees and related net credits; $3.4 million of separation charges, $2.8 million net gains on lease modifications, and $10.4 million of amortization of debt discount related to the Company convertible senior notes (or a combined $76.7 million negative impact after considering the related tax benefit of these adjustments as well as the impact from cumulative valuation allowances, partially offset by tax benefits from an income tax rate change due to net operating loss carryback of $14.2 million), or a unfavorable $1.20 per share impact. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net loss attributable to Guess?, Inc. was $4.5 million and adjusted diluted loss was $0.07 per common share for fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2020, the Company recognized $10.0 million of asset impairment charges; a net credit of $0.9 million of certain professional service, legal fees and related net credits, $0.4 million of separation charges and $7.6 million of amortization of debt discount related to the Company convertible senior notes (or a combined $9.1 million after considering the related tax benefit of these adjustments as well as the impact from changes in the tax law on deferred taxes in certain tax jurisdictions, net tax settlements and adjustments to specific uncertain tax positions totaling $8.1 million), or an unfavorable $0.12 per share impact. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. were $105.0 million and adjusted diluted earnings were $1.45 per common share for fiscal 2020. References to financial results excluding the impact of these items are non-GAAP measures and are addressed below under Non-GAAP Measures. Highlights of the Company performance for fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year are presented below, followed by a more comprehensive discussion under Results of Operations : Operations Total net revenue decreased 29.9% to $1.88 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $2.68 billion in the prior year. In constant currency, net revenue decreased by 31.0%. Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of total net revenue) decreased 80 basis points to 37.1% for fiscal 2021, compared to 37.9% in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses as a percentage of total net revenue ( SG&A rate ) increased 390 basis points to 36.1% for fiscal 2021, compared to 32.2% in the prior year. SG&A expenses decreased 21.4% to $680.0 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $865.1 million in the prior year. During fiscal 2021, the Company recognized asset impairment charges of $80.4 million, compared to $10.0 million in the prior year. 33 Table of C ontents During fiscal 2021, the Company recognized net gains on lease modifications of $2.8 million, compared to none in the prior year. Operating margin decreased 850 basis points to negative 3.2% for fiscal 2021, compared to 5.3% in the prior year, driven primarily by overall deleveraging of expenses and higher asset impairment charges due to the negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenues and global operations. Higher asset impairment charges during fiscal 2021 unfavorably impacted operating margin by 390 basis points compared to the prior year. Loss from operations was $60.5 million for fiscal 2021, compared to earnings from operations of $140.7 million in the prior year. Other expense, net (including interest income and expense) totaled $26.6 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $16.9 million in the prior year. The effective income tax rate decreased to 7.3% for fiscal 2021, compared to 18.2% in the prior year. The Company effective income tax rate for fiscal 2021 included unfavorable impact from certain discrete tax adjustments totaling $4.1 million. Key Balance Sheet Accounts The Company had $469.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $0.2 million in restricted cash as of January 30, 2021, compared to $284.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $0.2 million in restricted cash at February 1, 2020. The Company had $56.8 million in outstanding borrowings under its term loans as of January 30, 2021, compared to none as of February 1, 2020 and $7.3 million in outstanding borrowings under its credit facilities as of January 30, 2021, compared to $4.0 million as of February 1, 2020, to help ensure financial flexibility and liquidity in response to uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. During fiscal 2021, the Company repurchased 4.0 million shares of its common stock for $38.9 million (including commissions). During fiscal 2020, the Company used $170 million of proceeds from its offering of convertible senior notes to enter into an accelerated share repurchase program ( ASR Contract ), pursuant to which it received a total of approximately 10.6 million shares. The Company also repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares of its common stock for $118.1 million (including commissions) during 2020. Accounts receivable consists of trade receivables relating primarily to the Company wholesale business in Europe and, to a lesser extent, to its wholesale businesses in the Americas and Asia, royalty receivables relating to its licensing operations, credit card and retail concession receivables related to its retail businesses and certain other receivables. Accounts receivable decreased by $13.1 million, or 4.0%, to $314.1 million as of January 30, 2021, compared to $327.3 million at February 1, 2020. On a constant currency basis, accounts receivable decreased by $32.4 million, or 9.9%. Inventory decreased by $4.0 million, or 1.0%, to $389.1 million as of January 30, 2021, from $393.1 million at February 1, 2020. On a constant currency basis, inventory decreased by $21.4 million, or 5.4%. Global Store Count In fiscal 2021, together with our partners, we opened 35 new stores worldwide, consisting of 24 stores in Europe and the Middle East, ten stores in Asia and the Pacific and one store in Central and South America. Together with our partners, we closed 194 stores worldwide, consisting of 106 stores in Asia and the Pacific, 44 stores in Europe and the Middle East, 31 stores in the U.S., nine stores in Central and South America and four stores in Canada. 34 Table of C ontents We ended fiscal 2021 with 1,570 stores and 376 concessions worldwide, comprised as follows: Stores Concessions Region Total Directly Operated Partner Operated Total Directly Operated Partner Operated United States 251 249 2 1 1 Canada 76 76 Central and South America 105 70 35 27 27 Total Americas 432 395 37 28 27 1 Europe and the Middle East 725 507 218 44 44 Asia and the Pacific 413 144 269 304 101 203 Total 1,570 1,046 524 376 172 204 Of the total 1,570 stores, 1,300 were GUESS? stores, 173 were GUESS? Accessories stores, 62 were G by GUESS (GbG) stores and 35 were MARCIANO stores. Results of Operations The following table sets forth actual operating results for the fiscal years 2021 and 2020 as a percentage of net revenue: Years Ended January 30, February 1, 2021 2020 Product sales 96.1 % 96.8 % Net royalties 3.9 3.2 Net revenue 100.0 100.0 Cost of product sales 62.9 62.1 Gross profit 37.1 37.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 36.1 32.2 Asset impairment charges 4.3 0.4 Net gains on lease modifications (0.1) 0.0 Earnings (loss) from operations (3.2) 5.3 Interest expense (1.2) (0.6) Interest income 0.1 0.1 Other income (expense), net (0.3) (0.2) Earnings (loss) before income tax expense (4.6) 4.6 Income tax expense (benefit) (0.3) 0.8 Net earnings (loss) (4.3) 3.8 Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 0.2 Net earnings (loss) attributable to Guess?, Inc. (4.3 %) 3.6 % Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020 Consolidated Results Net Revenue . Net revenue decreased by $801.6 million, or 29.9%, to $1.88 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $2.68 billion in fiscal 2020. In constant currency, net revenue decreased by 31.0%, driven primarily by temporary store closures and, to a lesser extent, lower store traffic resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and a shift in wholesale shipments in Europe. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our foreign operations favorably impacted net revenue by $29.5 million compared to the prior year. 35 Table of C ontents Gross Margin. Gross margin decreased 80 basis points to 37.1% for fiscal 2021, compared to 37.9% in fiscal 2020, of which 140 basis points was due to a higher occupancy rate, partially offset by 60 basis points was due to higher product margins. The higher occupancy rate was driven primarily by deleveraging of occupancy costs due mainly to lower revenue resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the favorable impact from rent concessions granted related to COVID-19 pandemic primarily in Europe. The higher product margins were driven primarily by higher initial markups in Europe, partially offset by higher inventory reserves in Asia during the fiscal 2021, compared to fiscal 2020. Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased by $318.6 million, or 31.4%, to $697.1 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $1.0 billion in fiscal 2020. The decrease in gross profit, which included a favorable impact from currency translation, was due primarily to the unfavorable impact on gross profit from lower revenue, partially offset by lower occupancy costs. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our foreign operations favorably impacted gross profit by $15.7 million. The Company includes inbound freight charges, purchasing costs and related overhead, retail store occupancy costs, including lease costs and depreciation and amortization, and a portion of the Company distribution costs related to its retail business in cost of product sales. The Company also includes net royalties received on the Company inventory purchases of licensed product as a reduction to cost of product sales. The Company gross margin may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all of the costs related to their distribution in cost of product sales and others, like the Company, generally exclude wholesale-related distribution costs from gross margin, including them instead in SG&A expenses. Additionally, some entities include retail store occupancy costs in SG&A expenses and others, like the Company, include retail store occupancy costs in cost of product sales. SG&A Rate. The Company SG&A rate increased 390 basis points to 36.1% for fiscal 2021, compared to 32.2% in fiscal 2020. The Company SG&A rate included the unfavorable impact of 10 basis points from lower net credits related to professional service, legal fees and related net credits which the Company otherwise would not have incurred as part of its business operations. The Company SG&A rate also included the unfavorable impact of 10 basis points from separation charges. Excluding these amounts, the Company SG&A rate would have increased 370 basis points during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, driven by overall deleveraging of expenses due mainly to lower revenue resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by expense savings. SG&A Expenses. SG&A expenses decreased by $185.1 million, or 21.4%, to $680.0 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $865.1 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease, which included an unfavorable impact from currency translation, was driven primarily by lower payroll costs and, to a lesser extent, lower overall discretionary expenses. The lower payroll costs were driven primarily by the impact of furloughs and, to a lesser extent, government assistance programs related to the recovery of employee payroll costs, temporary tiered salary reductions for management level corporate employees that have since been restored and permanent headcount reductions. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our foreign operations unfavorably impacted SG&A expenses by $7.7 million. Asset Impairment Charges. During fiscal 2021, the Company recognized $45.4 million in impairment of certain operating lease right-of-use assets and $35.0 million in impairment of property and equipment related to certain retail locations resulting from lower revenue and future cash flow projections from the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This compares to $7.5 million in impairment of property and equipment, $1.5 million in impairment of goodwill, and $1.0 million in impairment of certain operating lease right-of-use assets related to certain retail locations resulting from under-performance and expected store closures during fiscal 2020. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our foreign operations favorably impacted asset impairment charges by $1.4 million during fiscal 2021. Net Gains on Lease Modifications. During fiscal 2021, the Company recorded net gains on lease modifications of $2.8 million related primarily to the early termination of lease agreements for certain of the Company retail locations. There were no net gains on lease modifications recorded during fiscal 2020. Operating Margin. Operating margin decreased 850 basis points to negative 3.2% for fiscal 2021, compared to 5.3% in fiscal 2020, driven primarily by overall deleveraging of expenses due to the negative impact from the 36 Table of C ontents COVID-19 pandemic on our global operations and, to a lesser extent, higher asset impairment charges. Lower net credits related to certain professional service, legal fees and related net credits recorded during fiscal 2021 unfavorably impacted operating margin by 10 basis points compared to the prior year. Higher separation charges recorded during fiscal 2021 impacted operating margin by 10 basis points compared to the prior year. Higher asset impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2021 unfavorably impacted operating margin by 390 basis points compared to the prior year. Net gains on lease modifications favorably impacted operating margin by 10 basis points compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of these items, operating margin decreased by 450 basis points compared to the prior year. Currency exchange rate fluctuations had an immaterial impact on operating margin. Earnings (Loss) from Operations. Loss from operations was $60.5 million for fiscal 2021, compared to earnings from operations of $140.7 million in fiscal 2020. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our foreign operations favorably impacted earnings from operations by $9.3 million. Interest Expense, Net . Interest expense, net, was $20.6 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $14.4 million in fiscal 2020. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher amortization of debt discount and higher interest expense related to the Company convertible senior notes. Other Expense, Net. Other expense, net, was $6.0 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $2.5 million in fiscal 2020. The change was due primarily to net mark-to-market losses on revaluation of foreign exchange currency contracts, compared to gains in the prior year. Income Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax benefit for fiscal 2021 was $6.3 million, or a 7.3% effective income tax rate, compared to income tax expense of $22.5 million, or an 18.2% effective income tax rate, in fiscal 2020. The Company recognized a valuation allowance of $4.2 million resulting from jurisdictions where there have been cumulative net operating losses, limiting the Company ability to consider other subjective evidence to continue to recognize the existing deferred tax assets. This was partially offset by a tax benefit of approximately $0.7 million from a tax rate change related to the ability to carryback net operating losses to tax years with a higher federal corporate tax rate as allowed under the CARES Act enacted in March 2020. Excluding the impact of these items, the change in the effective income tax rate was due primarily to a shift in the distribution of earnings among the Company tax jurisdictions during fiscal 2021, compared to the prior year. Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2021 was $0.5 million, net of taxes, compared to $5.3 million, net of taxes, in fiscal 2020. Net Earnings (Loss) Attributable to Guess?, Inc. Net loss attributable to Guess?, Inc. was $81.2 million for fiscal 2021, compared to net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. of $96.0 million in fiscal 2020. Diluted loss per share was $1.27 for fiscal 2021, compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.33 in fiscal 2020. We estimate that the unfavorable impact from share repurchases and additional interest expense recognized related to the convertible senior notes had a net negative impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.19 for fiscal 2021. We also estimate that the negative impact of currency on diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2021 was approximately $0.04 per share. During fiscal 2021, the Company recognized $80.4 million of asset impairment charges; $2.8 million of net gains on lease modifications; a net credit of $0.6 million of certain professional service, legal fees and related net credits; $3.4 million of separation charges and $10.4 million of amortization of debt discount related to the Company convertible senior notes (or a combined $76.7 million, or $1.20 per share, negative impact after considering the related tax benefit of these adjustments of $14.2 million). Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net loss attributable to Guess?, Inc. was $4.5 million and adjusted diluted loss was $0.07 per common share for fiscal 2021. We estimate that the favorable impact from share repurchases offset by the unfavorable impact from additional interest expense recognized related to the convertible senior notes had a positive impact of $0.06 on adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2020, the Company recognized $10.0 million of asset impairment charges; a net credit of $0.9 million of certain professional service, legal fees and related net credits, $0.4 million of separation charges and $7.6 million of amortization of debt discount related to the Company convertible senior notes (or a combined $9.1 million, or $0.12 per share, negative impact after considering the related tax benefit of $8.1 million). Excluding the impact of these items, 37 Table of C ontents adjusted net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. were $105.0 million and adjusted diluted earnings were $1.45 per common share for fiscal 2020. References to financial results excluding the impact of these items are non-GAAP measures and are addressed below under Non-GAAP Measures. Information by Business Segment The following table presents our net revenue and earnings (loss) from operations by segment for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): Fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2020 Change % Change Net revenue: Americas Retail $ 510,806 $ 811,547 $ (300,741) (37.1 %) Americas Wholesale 117,607 186,389 (68,782) (36.9 %) Europe 941,546 1,248,114 (306,568) (24.6 %) Asia 232,574 346,212 (113,638) (32.8 %) Licensing 73,996 85,847 (11,851) (13.8 %) Total net revenue $ 1,876,529 $ 2,678,109 $ (801,580) (29.9 %) Earnings (loss) from operations: Americas Retail $ (15,776) $ 22,279 $ (38,055) (170.8 %) Americas Wholesale 19,912 35,674 (15,762) (44.2 %) Europe 66,790 134,078 (67,288) (50.2 %) Asia (20,758) (8,894) (11,864) 133.4 % Licensing 67,938 74,459 (6,521) (8.8 %) Total segment earnings (loss) from operations 118,106 257,596 (139,490) (54.2 %) Corporate overhead (100,962) (106,948) 5,986 (5.6 %) Asset impairment charges (80,442) (9,977) (70,465) 706.3 % Net gains on lease modifications 2,801 2,801 Total earnings (loss) from operations $ (60,497) $ 140,671 $ (201,168) (143.0 %) Operating margins: Americas Retail (3.1 %) 2.7 % Americas Wholesale 16.9 % 19.1 % Europe 7.1 % 10.7 % Asia (8.9 %) (2.6 %) Licensing 91.8 % 86.7 % Total Company (3.2 %) 5.3 % Americas Retail Net revenue from our Americas Retail segment decreased by $300.7 million, or 37.1%, to $510.8 million for fiscal 2021, from $811.5 million in fiscal 2020. In constant currency, net revenue decreased by 36.7% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by temporary store closures and, to a lesser extent, lower store traffic resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding the impact from the temporary store closures, the store base for the U.S. and Canada decreased by an average of 28 net stores in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year, resulting in a 5.1% net decrease in average square footage. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our non-U.S. retail stores and e-commerce sites unfavorably impacted net revenue by $3.1 million. Operating margin decreased 580 basis points to negative 3.1% for fiscal 2021, from 2.7% in fiscal 2020, due to lower gross margins and, to a lesser extent, a higher SG&A rate. The lower gross margins were driven primarily by overall deleveraging of occupancy costs due primarily to the negative impact from temporary store closures and lower store traffic. The higher SG&A rate was driven primarily by overall deleveraging of expenses, 38 Table of C ontents partially offset by lower store selling expenses due to payroll savings resulting from the temporary furlough of the Company store associates in the U.S. and Canada and lower overall payroll costs. Loss from operations from our Americas Retail segment was $15.8 million for fiscal 2021 compared to earnings from operations of $22.3 million in fiscal 2020. The deterioration is primarily due to the unfavorable impact on earnings from lower revenue, partially offset by lower store selling expenses and lower occupancy costs . Americas Wholesale Net revenue from our Americas Wholesale segment decreased by $68.8 million, or 36.9%, to $117.6 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $186.4 million in fiscal 2020. In constant currency, net revenue decreased by 34.8% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by our U.S. wholesale business due mainly to lower demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our non-U.S. wholesale businesses unfavorably impacted net revenue by $3.9 million. Operating margin decreased 220 basis points to 16.9% for fiscal 2021, compared to 19.1% in fiscal 2020, due primarily to a higher SG&A rate driven primarily by overall deleveraging of expenses resulting from lower wholesale shipments. Earnings from operations from our Americas Wholesale segment decreased by $15.8 million, or 44.2%, to $19.9 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $35.7 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease was driven primarily by the unfavorable impact on earnings from lower revenue. Europe Net revenue from our Europe segment decreased by $306.6 million, or 24.6%, to $941.5 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2020. In constant currency, net revenue decreased by 27.2% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by temporary store closures and lower store traffic resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and, to a lesser extent, a shift in wholesale shipments into fiscal 2022 resulting from lower demand. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our European operations favorably impacted net revenue by $33.1 million. Operating margin decreased 360 basis points to 7.1% for fiscal 2021, compared to 10.7% in fiscal 2020, driven by a higher SG&A rate, partially offset by higher gross margins. The higher SG&A rate was due primarily to overall deleveraging of expenses resulting from lower revenue. The higher gross margins were driven primarily by higher initial markups, and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact from certain rent concessions granted related to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by overall deleveraging of occupancy costs due to lower revenue. Earnings from operations from our Europe segment decreased by $67.3 million, or 50.2%, to $66.8 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $134.1 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease was driven primarily by the unfavorable impact on earnings from lower revenue, partially offset by lower occupancy costs and, to a lesser extent, lower SG&A expenses. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our European operations favorably impacted earnings from operations by $7.4 million. Asia Net revenue from our Asia segment decreased by $113.6 million, or 32.8%, to $232.6 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $346.2 million in fiscal 2020. In constant currency, net revenue decreased by 33.8% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by lower store traffic and, to a lesser extent, permanent store closures and temporary store closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our Asian operations favorably impacted net revenue by $3.4 million. Operating margin decreased 630 basis points to negative 8.9% for fiscal 2021, from negative 2.6% in fiscal 2020, driven by lower gross margins and, to a lesser extent, a higher SG&A rate. The lower gross margins were due primarily to the negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in higher inventory reserves. The higher SG&A rate was driven primarily by overall deleveraging of expenses, partially offset by the favorable impact of business mix. 39 Table of C ontents Loss from operations from our Asia segment was $20.8 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $8.9 million in fiscal 2020. The deterioration was driven primarily by the unfavorable impact on earnings from lower revenue and, to a lesser extent, lower product margins, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses and, to a lesser extent, lower occupancy costs. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our Asian operations favorably impacted loss from operations by $1.3 million. Licensing Net royalty revenue from our Licensing segment decreased by $11.9 million, or 13.8%, to $74.0 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $85.8 million in fiscal 2020. Earnings from operations from our Licensing segment decreased by $6.5 million, or 8.8%, to $67.9 million for fiscal 2021, from $74.5 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease was driven by the unfavorable impact to earnings from lower revenue. Corporate Overhead Unallocated corporate overhead decreased by $6.0 million to $101.0 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $106.9 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease was driven primarily by lower overall discretionary expenses and, to a lesser extent, lower performance-based compensation costs. Fiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019 The comparison of fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2019 has been omitted from this Form 10-K, but can be referenced in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020, filed on April 1, 2020. Non-GAAP Measures The Company reported financial results are presented in accordance with GAAP. The reported net earnings (loss) attributable to Guess?, Inc. and diluted earnings (loss) per share in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 reflect the impact of certain professional service, legal fees and related net credits, certain separation charges, asset impairment charges, net gains on lease modifications, non-cash amortization of debt discount on the Company convertible senior notes, the related tax impacts of these adjustments as well as certain discrete tax adjustments, where applicable. Fiscal 2020 also includes the impact from changes in the tax law on deferred taxes in certain tax jurisdictions, net tax settlements and adjustments to specific uncertain tax positions. These items affect the comparability of the Company reported results. The financial results are also presented on a non-GAAP basis, as defined in Section 10(e) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, to exclude the effect of these items. The Company believes that these non-GAAP or adjusted financial measures are useful for investors to evaluate the comparability of the Company operating results and its future outlook when reviewed in conjunction with the Company GAAP financial statements. The non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as alternatives for, the Company reported GAAP results. The adjusted measures for fiscal 2021 exclude the impact of $80.4 million of asset impairment charges; $3.4 million of separation charges; $10.4 million of amortization of debt discount on the Company convertible senior notes; $2.8 million of net gains on lease modifications; and a net credit of $0.6 million of certain professional service, legal fees and related net credits. The asset impairment charges related to certain retail locations resulting from lower revenue and future cash flow projections from the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The $3.4 million in separation-related charges mainly related to headcount reduction in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain professional service, legal fees and related (credits) costs were primarily due to amounts which the Company otherwise would not have incurred as part of its business operations. These items resulted in a combined $76.7 million impact (after considering the related tax benefit based on the Company assessment of deductibility using the statutory income tax rate, inclusive of the impact of valuation allowances, totaling $14.2 million), or an unfavorable $1.20 per share impact during fiscal 2021. Net loss attributable to Guess?, Inc. was $81.2 million and diluted loss per common share were $1.27 for fiscal 2021. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net loss attributable to Guess?, Inc. was $4.5 million and adjusted diluted loss per common share was $0.07 for fiscal 2021. The adjusted measures for fiscal 2020 exclude the impact of asset impairment charges of $10.0 million, $7.6 million of amortization of debt discount on the Company convertible senior notes; net credit of certain 40 Table of C ontents professional service, legal fees and related net credits of $0.9 million, and separation charges of $0.4 million. The asset impairment charges related primarily to the impairment of certain retail locations resulting from under-performance and expected store closures, and, to a lesser extent, impairment charges related to goodwill associated with the Company China retail reporting unit and impairment charges related to certain operating lease right-of-use assets. Certain professional service, legal fees and related net credits were primarily due to amounts which the Company otherwise would not have incurred as part of its business operations. During fiscal 2020, the Company recorded $0.4 million in separation-related charges related to the departure of our former CEO. These charges mainly related to non-cash stock-based compensation expense resulting from changes in expected performance conditions of certain previously granted stock awards that were no longer subject to service vesting requirements after his departure. These items resulted in a combined $9.1 million impact (after considering the related tax benefit as well as the impact from changes in the tax law on deferred taxes in certain tax jurisdictions, net tax settlements and adjustments to specific uncertain tax positions totaling $8.1 million), or an unfavorable $0.12 per share impact during fiscal 2020. Net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. were $96.0 million and diluted earnings per common share were $1.33 for fiscal 2020. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. were $105.0 million and adjusted diluted earnings per common share were $1.45 for fiscal 2020. Our discussion and analysis herein also include certain constant currency financial information. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amount reported from translating the Company foreign revenue, expenses and balance sheet amounts into U.S. dollars. These rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported operating results under GAAP. The Company provides constant currency information to enhance the visibility of underlying business trends, excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency translation rates. To calculate net revenue, comparable store sales and earnings (loss) from operations on a constant currency basis, operating results for the current-year period are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable period of the prior year. To calculate balance sheet amounts on a constant currency basis, the current year balance sheet amount is translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the comparable prior-year period end. The constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency that is different to the functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate. The constant currency information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In calculating the estimated impact of currency fluctuations (including translational and transactional impacts) on other measures such as earnings (loss) per share, the Company estimates gross margin (including the impact of foreign exchange currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges for anticipated merchandise purchases) and expenses using the appropriate prior-year rates, translates the estimated foreign earnings (loss) at the comparable prior-year rates and excludes the year-over-year earnings impact of gains or losses arising from balance sheet remeasurement and foreign exchange currency contracts not designated as cash flow hedges for merchandise purchases. Liquidity and Capital Resources We need liquidity globally primarily to fund our working capital, occupancy costs, interest payments on our debt, remodeling and rationalization of our retail stores, shop-in-shop programs, concessions, systems, infrastructure, other existing operations, expansion plans, international growth and potential acquisitions and investments. In addition, in the U.S. we need liquidity to fund share repurchases and payment of dividends to our stockholders. Generally, our working capital needs are highest during the late summer and fall as our inventories increase before the holiday selling period. During the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021, we relied primarily on trade credit, available cash, real estate and other operating leases, finance leases, proceeds from our credit facilities and term loans and internally generated funds to finance our operations. We anticipate that we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements during the next 12 months for working capital, capital expenditures, payments on our debt, finance leases and operating leases as well as lease modification payments, potential acquisitions and investments, share repurchases and dividend payments to stockholders, primarily with cash flow from operations and existing cash balances as supplemented by borrowings under our existing Credit Facility in the U.S. and Canada as well as bank facilities in Europe and China and proceeds from our term loans, as needed. As further noted below under the COVID-19 Business Update section and in Part IV. Financial Statements 41 Table of C ontents Note 1 Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices , the Company has also implemented a number of other measures to help preserve liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to settle the principal amount of our outstanding convertible senior notes in 2024 in cash and any excess in shares. Such arrangements are described further in Part IV. Financial Statements Note 8 Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations and Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 10 Convertible Senior Notes and Related Transactions in this Form 10-K. Due to the seasonality of our business and cash needs, we may increase borrowings under our established credit facilities from time-to-time, during the next 12 months. If we experience a sustained decrease in consumer demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may require access to additional credit, which may not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the CARES Act to provide economic relief from the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other provisions, the CARES Act allows for a full offset of taxable income in a five-year carryback period for net operating losses, which will reduce current period tax expense and may result in a refund of previously paid income tax amounts at higher historical tax rates. During the year ended January 30, 2021, the Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately $0.7 million related to the CARES Act. The Company has a balance related to Tax Reform transition tax included in other long-term liabilities of $19.9 million (excluding related interest) for each of the years ended January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020. Refer to Part IV. Financial Statements Note 12 Income Taxes for further detail. The Company has historically considered the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the Tax Reform, the Company had a substantial amount of previously taxed earnings that could be distributed to the U.S. without additional U.S. taxation. The Company continues to evaluate its plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and regularly reviews its cash positions and determination of permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings. If the Company determines that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, it may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, beyond the Tax Reform one-time transition tax. The Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from the Company foreign subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not already been recorded. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if these earnings were repatriated due to the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation . As of January 30, 2021, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $469.1 million, of which approximately $102.2 million was held in the U.S. Excess cash and cash equivalents, which represent the majority of our outstanding cash and cash equivalents balance, are held primarily in overnight deposit and short-term time deposit accounts and money market accounts. Please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risk factors which could reasonably be likely to result in a decrease of internally generated funds available to finance capital expenditures and working capital requirements. COVID-19 Impact on Liquidity Refer to the COVID-19 Business Update section above and in Part IV. Financial Statements Note 1 Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices for a discussion of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial performance and our liquidity. In light of store closures and reduced traffic in stores, the Company has taken certain actions with respect to certain of its existing leases, including engaging with landlords to discuss rent deferrals as well as other rent concessions. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have suspended rental payments and/or paid reduced rental amounts with respect to our retail stores that were closed or experiencing drastically reduced customer traffic as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the last year, we have successfully negotiated with several landlords, including some of our larger landlords and have received rent abatement benefits as well as new lease terms for some of our affected leases. The Company continues to engage in discussions with additional affected landlords in an effort to achieve appropriate rent relief and other lease concessions and, in some cases, to terminate existing leases. In a few instances, where negotiations with landlords have proven unsuccessful, the Company is engaged in litigation related to rent obligations both during the COVID-19 pandemic and through the term of the lease . 42 Table of C ontents Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020 The Company has presented below the cash flow performance comparison of the year ended January 30, 2021 versus the year ended February 1, 2020. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $209.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021, compared to $197.9 million for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020, or an increase of $11.1 million. The improvement was driven primarily by favorable changes in working capital, partially offset by lower cash flows generated from net earnings. The favorable changes in working capital were due primarily to the extension of vendor payment terms on our accounts payable balances and the suspension and/or reduction of our operating lease payments, which could be temporary, as well as overall lower expenditures and improved inventory management during fiscal 2021. In addition, during fiscal 2020, net cash used in operating activities included the payment of the European Commission fine of $45.6 million which was imposed and accrued in fiscal 2019. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $22.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021, compared to $56.5 million for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020. Net cash used in investing activities related primarily to capital expenditures incurred on investments in technology infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, existing store remodeling programs and international retail expansion. In addition, purchases of investments, settlements of forward exchange currency contracts and proceeds from the sale of long-term assets are also included in cash flows used in investing activities. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by lower spending on retail expansion during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. During the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021, the Company opened 22 directly operated stores compared to 66 directly operated stores that were opened in the prior year. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $9.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021, compared to $64.2 million for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020. Cash used in financing activities related primarily to the repurchases of shares of the Company common stock. In addition, payment of dividends, cash activity from the issuance of common stock under our equity plans, payments related to finance lease obligations, net proceeds from borrowings and net proceeds related to issuance of convertible senior notes and related warrants are also included in cash flows used in financing activities. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by the lower investments made in share repurchases and, to a lesser extent, lower payment of dividends and higher net proceeds received from borrowings during fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes and related warrants during fiscal 2020. Effect of Exchange Rates on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash During the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021, changes in foreign currency translation rates increased our reported cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance by $7.5 million. This compares to a decrease of $3.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash driven by changes in foreign currency translation rates during the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020. Working Capital As of January 30, 2021, the Company had net working capital (including cash and cash equivalents) of $470.0 million, compared to $425.8 million at February 1, 2020. The Company primary working capital needs are for the current portion of lease liabilities, accounts receivable and inventory. The accounts receivable balance consists of trade receivables relating primarily to the Company wholesale business in Europe and, to a lesser extent, to its wholesale businesses in the Americas and Asia, royalty receivables relating to its licensing operations, credit card and retail concession receivables related to its retail businesses and certain other receivables. Accounts receivable decreased by $13.1 million, or 4.0%, to $314.1 million as of January 30, 2021, compared to $327.3 million at February 1, 2020. On a constant currency 43 Table of C ontents basis, accounts receivable decreased by $32.4 million, or 9.9%, when compared to February 1, 2020. As of January 30, 2021, approximately 49% of our total net trade receivables and 61% of our European net trade receivables were subject to credit insurance coverage, certain bank guarantees or letters of credit for collection purposes. Our credit insurance coverage contains certain terms and conditions specifying deductibles and annual claim limits. Inventory decreased by $4.0 million, or 1.0%, to $389.1 million as of January 30, 2021, from $393.1 million at February 1, 2020. On a constant currency basis, inventory decreased by $21.4 million, or 5.4%, when compared to February 1, 2020, driven primarily by improved inventory management. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes the Company contractual obligations as of January 30, 2021 and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands): Payments due by period Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Contractual Obligations: Short-term borrowings $ 7,332 $ 7,332 $ $ $ Convertible senior notes, net 1,2 321,000 6,000 12,000 303,000 Long-term debt, excluding convertible senior notes, net 1 81,302 28,073 25,590 12,604 15,035 Finance lease obligations 1 26,125 6,068 10,967 5,893 3,197 Operating lease obligations 3 976,421 249,025 348,367 195,560 183,469 Purchase obligations 4 207,789 207,789 Benefit obligations 5 82,840 3,096 5,343 6,490 67,911 Total $ 1,702,809 $ 507,383 $ 402,267 $ 523,547 $ 269,612 Other commercial commitments 6 $ 2,100 $ 2,100 $ $ $ ______________________________________________________________________ 1 Includes interest payments. 2 In April 2019, the Company issued $300 million principal amount of 2.00% convertible senior notes due 2024 (the Notes ) in a private offering. Refer to Part IV. Financial Statements Note 10 Convertible Senior Notes and Related Transactions for further detail. 3 The Company has elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components in the measurement of liabilities for its directly-operated real estate leases. As such, this amount reflects operating lease costs that are considered in the measurement of the related operating lease liabilities, which may include fixed payments related to rent, insurance, property taxes, sales promotion, common area maintenance and certain utility charges, where applicable. This does not include variable lease costs that are excluded from the measurement of the operating lease liabilities, such as those charges that are based on a percentage of annual sales volume or estimates. In fiscal 2021, these variable charges totaled $54.1 million. Refer to Part IV. Financial Statements Note 9 Lease Accounting for further detail. 4 Purchase obligations represent open purchase orders for raw materials and merchandise at the end of the fiscal year. These purchase orders can be impacted by various factors, including the scheduling of market weeks, the timing of issuing orders, the timing of the shipment of orders and currency fluctuations. 5 Includes expected payments associated with the deferred compensation plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan through fiscal 2055. 6 Consists of standby letters of credit for workers compensation and general liability insurance. Excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the noncurrent liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including penalties and interest, of $40.0 million. This liability for unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded because the Company cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever. The above table also excludes current liabilities (other than short-term borrowings) as these amounts will be paid within one year and certain long-term liabilities that do not require cash payments. 44 Table of C ontents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than certain obligations and commitments included in the table above, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements as of January 30, 2021. Capital Expenditures Gross capital expenditures totaled $18.9 million, before deducting lease incentives of $2.3 million, for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021. This compares to gross capital expenditures of $61.9 million, before deducting lease incentives of $5.5 million, for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020. We will periodically evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances and pursue those that we believe will support and contribute to our overall growth initiatives. Dividends During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had deferred the decision with respect to the payment of its quarterly cash dividend. The Board of Directors decided to continue to postpone its decision with respect to the payment of its quarterly cash dividend during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 in order to preserve the Company cash position and provide continued financial flexibility in light of the uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company announced that it would resume paying its quarterly cash dividend of $0.1125 per share beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, but decided to not declare any cash dividends for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2021. Decisions on whether, when and in what amounts to continue making any future dividend distributions will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of the Company Board of Directors, which reserves the right to change or terminate the Company dividend practices at any time and for any reason without prior notice. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be based upon a number of business, legal and other considerations, including our cash flow from operations, capital expenditures, debt service and covenant requirements, cash paid for income taxes, earnings, share repurchases, economic conditions and U.S. and global liquidity. Share Repurchases On June 26, 2012, the Company Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase, from time-to-time and as market and business conditions warrant, up to $500 million of the Company common stock. Repurchases under the program may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or other available means. There is no minimum or maximum number of shares to be repurchased under the program, which may be discontinued at any time, without prior notice. During fiscal 2021, the Company repurchased 4,000,000 shares under the program at an aggregate cost of $38.9 million. During fiscal 2020, the Company repurchased 16,739,740 shares under the program at an aggregate cost of $288.1 million, which is inclusive of the shares repurchased under the ASR Contract as described below. During fiscal 2019, the Company repurchased 1,118,808 shares at an aggregate cost of $17.6 million. As of January 30, 2021, the Company had remaining authority under the program to purchase $47.8 million of its common stock. On April 26, 2019, pursuant to existing stock repurchase authorizations, the Company entered into an ASR Contract with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (in such capacity, the ASR Counterparty ), to repurchase an aggregate of $170 million of the Company common stock. Under the ASR Contract, the Company made an initial payment of $170 million to the ASR Counterparty and received an initial delivery of approximately 5.2 million shares of common stock, which represented approximately $102 million (or 60%) of the ASR Contract. The Company received a final delivery of an additional 5.4 million shares, or $68 million, under its ASR Contract during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The final share amount was determined based on the daily volume-weighted average price since the effective date of the ASR Contract, less the applicable contractual discount. When combined with the 5.2 million upfront shares received at the inception of the ASR in April 2019, the Company repurchased approximately 10.6 million of its shares under the ASR at an average repurchase price of $16.09 per share. All shares were repurchased in accordance with the Company publicly announced ASR program, which was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The shares delivered under the ASR Contract reduced the Company outstanding shares and its weighted average number of common shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share. 45 Table of C ontents Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations See Part IV. Financial Statements Note 8 Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations in this Form 10-K for disclosures about our borrowings and finance lease obligations. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan On August 23, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ( SERP ) which became effective January 1, 2006. The SERP provides select employees who satisfy certain eligibility requirements with certain benefits upon retirement, termination of employment, death, disability or a change in control of the Company, in certain prescribed circumstances. As a non-qualified pension plan, no dedicated funding of the SERP is required; however, the Company has made periodic payments into insurance policies held in a rabbi trust to fund the expected obligations arising under the non-qualified SERP. The amount of any future payments into the insurance policies, if any, may vary depending on investment performance of the trust. The cash surrender values of the insurance policies were $72.1 million and $67.7 million as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively, and were included in other assets in the Company consolidated balance sheets. As a result of changes in the value of the insurance policy investments, the Company recorded unrealized gains (losses) of $6.1 million, $7.6 million and $(1.1) million in other income (expense) during fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. The projected benefit obligation was $52.3 million and $51.9 million as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively, and was included in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the Company consolidated balance sheets depending on the expected timing of payments. SERP benefit payments of $1.7 million were made during both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company qualified employee stock purchase plan ( ESPP ) allows qualified employees (as defined) to participate in the purchase of designated shares of the Company common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the closing price at the beginning or end of each quarterly stock purchase period. The Company has 4,000,000 shares of common stock registered under the ESPP. The Company ESPP will remain in effect through March 11, 2022. During the year ended January 30, 2021, 86,780 shares of the Company common stock were issued pursuant to the ESPP at an average price of 11.82 per share for a total of $1.0 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience, an evaluation of current market trends as of the reporting date and other relevant factors, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the allowances for doubtful accounts, sales return and markdown allowances, gift card and loyalty accruals, valuation of inventories, share-based compensation, recoverability of deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, the useful life of assets for depreciation and amortization, evaluation of asset impairment (including goodwill and long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use ( ROU ) assets), pension obligations, workers compensation and medical self-insurance expense and accruals, litigation reserves and restructuring expense and accruals. The Company believes that the following significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. In addition to the accounting policies mentioned below, see Part IV. Financial Statements Note 1 Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices in this Form 10-K for other significant accounting policies. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts In the normal course of business, the Company grants credit directly to certain wholesale customers after a credit analysis is performed based on financial and other criteria. Accounts receivable are recorded net of an 46 Table of C ontents allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from the inability of its wholesale customers to make their required payments. The Company bases its allowances on analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements, assessments of historical and current collection trends, an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions and whether the Company has obtained credit insurance or other guarantees which are not considered freestanding against the related account receivable balances. Sales Return Allowances The Company accrues for estimated sales returns in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. To recognize the financial impact of sales returns, the Company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned based on historical experience and current trends and reduces sales and cost of sales accordingly. The Company policy allows retail customers in certain regions a grace period to return merchandise following the date of sale. Substantially all of these returns are considered to be resalable at a price that exceeds the cost of the merchandise. The Company includes the allowance for sales returns in accrued expenses and the estimated cost associated with such sales returns within other current assets in its consolidated balance sheet. Markdown Allowances Costs associated with customer markdowns are recorded as a reduction to revenues and any amounts unapplied to existing receivables are included in accrued expenses. Historically, these markdown allowances resulted from seasonal negotiations with the Company wholesale customers, as well as historical trends and the evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions. Gift Cards Gift card breakage is income recognized due to the non-redemption of a portion of gift cards sold by the Company for which a liability was recorded in prior periods. Gifts cards are mainly used in the U.S. and Canada. The Company issues its gift cards in the U.S. and Canada through one of its subsidiaries and is not required by law to escheat the value of unredeemed gift cards to the state in which the subsidiary is domiciled. Estimated breakage amounts are accounted for under the redemption recognition method and are classified as additional net revenues as the gift cards are redeemed. The Company determined a gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns, which represented the cumulative estimated amount of gift card breakage from the inception of the electronic gift card program in late 2002. Any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage income recognized in future periods. Loyalty Programs The Company has customer loyalty programs in North America, Europe and Asia which cover all of its brands. Under certain of the programs, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, customers accumulate points based on purchase activity. Once a loyalty program member achieves a certain point level, the member earns awards that may only be redeemed for merchandise. Unredeemed points generally expire after six months without additional purchase activity and unredeemed awards generally expire after two months. Where applicable, the Company allocates a portion of the transaction price from sales in its direct-to-consumer channel to its loyalty program by using historical redemption rates to estimate the value of future award redemptions. This amount is accrued in current liabilities and recorded as a reduction of net revenue in the period which the related revenue is recognized. Inventory Reserves Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (primarily weighted average method) or net realizable value. The Company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving product as well as prior seasons inventory. Net realizable value of aged inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for each product line category, the impact of market trends, an evaluation of economic conditions, available liquidation channels and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory. The Company closely monitors off-price sales to ensure the actual results closely match initial estimates. Estimates are regularly updated based upon this continuing review. 47 Table of C ontents Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value. The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and involves several assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, dividend yield and expected life. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of the option at the time of grant. The expected stock price volatility is determined based on an average of both historical volatility and implied volatility. Implied volatility is derived from exchange traded options on the Company common stock. The expected dividend yield is based on the Company history and expectations of dividend payouts. The expected life is determined based on historical trends. Compensation expense for nonvested stock options and stock awards/units that are not subject to performance-based vesting conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur. In addition, the Company has granted certain nonvested units that require certain minimum performance targets to be achieved in order for these awards to vest. Vesting is also subject to continued service requirements through the vesting date. Compensation expense for performance-based awards that vest in increments is recognized based on an accelerated attribution method. If the minimum performance targets are not forecasted to be achieved, no expense is recognized during the period. The Company has also granted certain nonvested stock units which are subject to market-based performance targets in order for these units to vest. Vesting is also subject to continued service requirements through the vesting date. The grant date fair value for such nonvested stock units was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation that incorporates option-pricing inputs covering the period from the grant date through the end of the performance period. Compensation expense for such nonvested stock units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied. Certain restricted stock units vest immediately but are considered contingently returnable as a result of certain service conditions. Compensation expense for these types of restricted stock units are recognized on a straight-line basis over the implied service period. Derivatives Foreign Exchange Currency Contracts The Company operates in foreign countries, which exposes it to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company has entered into certain forward contracts to hedge the risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations. The Company has elected to apply the hedge accounting rules in accordance with authoritative guidance for certain of these hedges. The Company primary objective is to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flows due to the foreign currency risk. Various transactions that occur primarily in Europe, Canada, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Mexico are denominated in U.S. dollars, British pounds and Russian roubles and thus are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to their functional currencies. These types of transactions include U.S. dollar-denominated purchases of merchandise and U.S. dollar- and British pound-denominated intercompany liabilities. In addition, certain operating expenses, tax liabilities and pension-related liabilities are denominated in Swiss francs and are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to the functional currency. Further, there are certain real estate leases which are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective entity that entered into the agreement (primarily Swiss francs, Russian roubles and Polish zloty). As a result, the Company may be exposed to volatility related to unrealized gains or losses on the translation of present value of future lease payment obligations when translated at the exchange rate as of a reporting period-end. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange currency contracts, to offset some but not all of the exchange risk on certain of these anticipated foreign currency transactions. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (expense) within stockholders equity and are recognized in cost of product sales in the period which approximates the time the hedged merchandise inventory is sold or, if applicable, in other income and expense in the period in which the hedged intercompany liability is incurred. 48 Table of C ontents Periodically, the Company may also use foreign exchange currency contracts to hedge the translation and economic exposures related to its net investments in certain of its international subsidiaries. Changes in the fair value of these U.S. dollar forward contracts, designated as net investment hedges, are recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders equity and are not recognized in earnings (loss) until the sale or liquidation of the hedged net investment. The Company also has foreign exchange currency contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. Changes in fair value of foreign exchange currency contracts not designated as hedging instruments are reported in net earnings (loss) as part of other income (expense). Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its floating-rate debt. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert its floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis. The principal objective of these contracts is to eliminate or reduce the variability of the cash flows in interest payments associated with the Company floating-rate debt, thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest payment cash flows. The Company has elected to apply the hedge accounting rules in accordance with authoritative guidance for certain of these contracts. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders equity and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt. Periodically, the Company may also enter into interest rate swap agreements that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements not designated as hedging instruments are reported in net earnings (loss) as part of other income (expense). Income Taxes The Company adopted authoritative guidance which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Guidance was also provided on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As required under applicable accounting rules, the Company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional income tax liability which the Company, more likely than not, will incur as a result of the ultimate resolution of income tax audits ( uncertain tax positions ). The Company reviews and updates the estimates used in the accrual for uncertain tax positions, as appropriate, as more definitive information or interpretations become available from taxing authorities, upon completion of tax audits, upon receipt of assessments, upon expiration of statutes of limitation, or upon occurrence of other events. The results of operations and financial position for future periods could be impacted by changes in assumptions or resolutions of tax audits. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized. The Company has historically considered the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the Tax Reform, the Company had a substantial amount of previously taxed earnings that could be distributed to the U.S. without additional U.S. taxation. The Company continues to evaluate its plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and regularly reviews its cash positions and determination of permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings. If the Company determines that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, it may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, beyond the Tax Reform one-time transition tax. The Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from the Company foreign subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not already been recorded. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if these earnings were repatriated due to the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation . 49 Table of C ontents Valuation of Goodwill, Intangible and Other Long-Lived Assets The Company assesses the impairment of its long-lived assets (related primarily to goodwill, property and equipment and operating right-of-use assets), which requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. For goodwill, determination of impairment is made at the reporting unit level which may be either an operating segment or one level below an operating segment if discrete financial information is available. Two or more reporting units within an operating segment may be aggregated for impairment testing if they have similar economic characteristics. The Company has identified its Americas Retail segment, its Americas Wholesale segment and its European wholesale and European retail components of its Europe segment as reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. For long-lived assets (other than goodwill), the majority relate to its retail operations which consist primarily of regular retail and flagship locations. The Company considers each individual regular retail location as an asset group for impairment testing, which is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. The asset group includes leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, computer hardware and software, operating lease right-of-use ( ROU ) assets including lease acquisition costs, and certain long-term security deposits, and excludes operating lease liabilities. The Company reviews regular retail locations in penetrated markets for impairment risk once the locations have been opened for at least one year in their current condition, or sooner as changes in circumstances require. The Company believes that waiting at least one year allows a location to reach a maturity level where a more comprehensive analysis of financial performance can be performed. The Company evaluates impairment risk for regular retail locations in new markets, where the Company is in the early stages of establishing its presence, once brand awareness has been established. The Company also evaluates impairment risk for retail locations that are expected to be closed in the foreseeable future. The Company has flagship locations which are used as a regional marketing tool to build brand awareness and promote the Company current product. Provided the flagship locations continue to meet appropriate criteria, impairment for these locations is tested at a reporting unit level similar to goodwill since they do not have separately identifiable cash flows. An asset is considered to be impaired if the Company determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon its assessment of the asset ability to continue to generate earnings from operations and positive cash flow in future periods or if significant changes in the Company strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets occurred. If the assets (other than goodwill) are assessed to be recoverable, they are depreciated or amortized over the periods benefited. If the assets are considered to be impaired, an impairment charge is recognized representing the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of those assets. The Company uses market participant rents to calculate fair value of ROU assets and discounted future cash flows of the asset group to quantify fair value for other long-lived assets. The impairment loss calculations require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows and the discount rates that reflect the risk inherent in future cash flows. Future expected cash flows for assets in regular retail locations are based on management estimates of future cash flows, which include sales and gross margin growth rate assumptions, over the remaining lease period or expected life, if shorter. For expected location closures, the Company will evaluate whether it is necessary to shorten the useful life for any of the assets within the respective asset group. The Company will use this revised useful life when estimating the asset group future cash flows. The Company considers historical trends, expected future business trends and other factors when estimating the future cash flow for each regular retail location. The Company also considers factors such as: the local environment for each regular retail location, including mall traffic and competition; the Company ability to successfully implement strategic initiatives; and the ability to control variable costs such as cost of sales and payroll and, in some cases, renegotiate lease costs. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, there may be additional exposure to future impairment losses that could be material to the Company results of operations. Pension Benefit Plan Actuarial Assumptions The Company pension obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, within the authoritative guidance framework. The Company uses the corridor approach to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains or losses over the average remaining service life of active participants. The life expectancy, estimated retirement age, discount rate, estimated future compensation and expected return on plan assets are important 50 Table of C ontents elements of expense and/or liability measurement. These critical assumptions are evaluated annually which enables expected future payments for benefits to be stated at present value on the measurement date. If actual results are not consistent with actuarial assumptions, the amounts recognized for the defined benefit plans could change significantly. Refer to Part IV. Financial Statements Note 13 Defined Benefit Plans in this Form 10-K for detail regarding the Company defined benefit plans. Litigation Reserves Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. As additional information becomes available, the Company assesses the potential liability related to new claims and existing claims and revises estimates as appropriate. As new claims arise or existing claims evolve, such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position. Convertible Senior Notes In April 2019, the Company issued $300 million principal amount of 2.00% convertible senior notes due 2024 (the Notes ) in a private offering. Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, in accounting for the issuance of the Notes, the Company separated the Notes into liability and equity components. The liability component was recorded at fair value, which was derived from a valuation technique used to calculate the fair value of a similar liability without an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, which is recognized as a debt discount, represents the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes and the fair value of the liability component of the Notes. In accounting for the debt issuance costs related to the issuance of the Notes, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components based on their relative values. Debt issuance costs attributable to the liability component were recorded as a contra-liability and are presented net against the convertible senior notes balance on the Company consolidated balance sheets. These costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Notes. Refer to Part IV. Financial Statements Note 10 Convertible Senior Notes and Related Transactions in this Form 10-K for details on the Company convertible senior notes. Recently Issued Accounting Guidance See Part IV. Financial Statements Note 2 New Accounting Guidance in this Form 10-K for disclosures about recently issued accounting guidance.
