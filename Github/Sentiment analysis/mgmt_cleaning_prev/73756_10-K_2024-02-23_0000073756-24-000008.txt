Item 1. Business, Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. For management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021, please refer to Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 24, 2023. Certain statements in this annual report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, statements regarding the following matters, are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: our business strategy; industry conditions and commodity pricing; seasonality; our expectations about 2024 results of operations, items below the income from operations ( operating income ) line and segment operating results, and the factors underlying those expectations, including our expectations about demand and pricing for our energy services and products as a result of the factors we specify in Overview of our Results and Results of Operations below; our expectations about the balance between energy transition and energy security; our emissions reduction targets; our backlog, to the extent backlog may be an indicator of future revenue or productivity; projections relating to floating rig demand and subsea tree installations; our expectations about our ROV fleet utilization in the future; the adequacy of our sources of liquidity, cash flows and capital resources to support our operations and internally generated growth initiatives; the collectability of accounts receivable and realizability of contract assets at the amounts reflected on our most-recent balance sheet; our future working capital needs and our projected capital expenditures for 2024; transactions we may engage in to manage our outstanding debt prior or maturity; our plans for future operations (including planned additions to and retirements from our remotely operated vehicle ( ROV ) fleet; our ability and intent to repatriate cash from Angola and other foreign countries where we have operations; our expectations regarding shares that may be repurchased under our share repurchase plan; and our expectations regarding the implementation of new accounting standards and related policies, procedures and controls. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those we refer to under the headings Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in Part I of this report. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, because of the inherent limitations in the forecasting process, as well as the relatively volatile nature of the industries in which we operate, we can give no assurance that those expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, evaluation of our future prospects must be made with caution when relying on forward-looking information. Our Engagement in the Energy Transition Oceaneering currently generates a substantial majority of its revenue from the oil and gas sector. Due to the continuing development of economies in developing countries, substantial projected population growth (particularly in developing countries), and the shortage of other sources of affordable, reliable, scalable and efficient energy, as well as rising worldwide demand for a myriad of products made with petrochemicals, we expect that the need for additional oil and gas exploration and development and inspection, maintenance and repair ( IMR ) activities will continue for decades to come. At the same time, due to increasing concerns about climate change, there is growing demand for cleaner hydrocarbon-based and renewable energy sources. We strive to meet the growing need for 32 Table of Contents / lower-carbon energy by assisting customers to reduce their carbon emissions in exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas, while also diversifying our business into new strategic growth areas in emerging energy and non-energy markets. We believe this measured approach ensures our resilience in an ever-changing market. Today, the impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities and balancing energy security with energy transition are influencing our strategy in the following ways: we are continuing to support our customers in producing oil and natural gas to meet global demand for energy, while developing methods to minimize their carbon footprint through increased efficiency and technological innovation; we are deploying our competencies and capabilities to serve the energy-transition markets, including those utilizing offshore wind installations (fixed and floating), nuclear, hydrogen, carbon-capture-and-sequestration and tidal energy technologies; and we are diversifying our businesses outside the energy industry into new strategic growth areas, such as mobility solutions and digital asset management, as well as increasing our participation in the aerospace and defense sectors. We are committed to the research and development of products and services intended to help our Energy business (defined below) customers to produce energy safely and securely, with decreased risk to humans and sea life and reduced environmental impacts. As an example, we are working to advance remote operations, which allow customers to reduce their carbon footprints by transferring offshore workers to onshore control centers, and allows for less risk to human health and safety, greater collaboration and faster response to real-time events. We are also committed to reducing our own energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to our operations. With the help of a third-party consultant over the past several years, we performed a global review of our assets and operations and identified our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for our 2022 baseline in accordance with best practice greenhouse gas accounting methodologies, including the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. In 2023, we established and announced our 2030 greenhouse gas Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission reduction targets against a 2022 baseline. Our 2023 Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures Report (the TCFD Report, which is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report) outlines our continued commitment to managing the risks and opportunities from climate change and contains our emissions reduction targets as well as our 2022 Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions data. Our capital investments and expenses required to achieve our goals cannot be estimated at this time. Overview of Our Results The table that follows sets out our revenue and operating results for 2023 and 2022. Year Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Revenue $ 2,424,706 $ 2,066,084 Gross Margin 398,971 307,377 Gross Margin % 16 % 15 % Operating Income (Loss) 181,328 110,863 Operating Income (Loss) % 7 % 5 % Net Income (Loss) 97,403 25,941 Our business segments are contained within two businesses services and products provided primarily to the oil and gas industry and, to a lesser extent, the offshore renewables and mobility solutions industry, among others ( Energy ) and services and products provided to non-energy industries ( Aerospace and Defense Technologies or ADTech ). Our four business segments within the Energy business are Subsea Robotics, Manufactured Products, Offshore Projects Group ( OPG ) and Integrity Management & Digital Solutions ( IMDS ). We report our Aerospace and Defense Technologies business as one segment. Unallocated Expenses are expenses not associated with a specific business segment. These consist of expenses related to our incentive and deferred compensation plans, including restricted stock and bonuses, as well as other general expenses, including corporate administrative expenses. Our business primarily depends on the level of spending on offshore developments and related operating activities by our customers in the energy industry. Compared to 2022, our 2023 revenue increased 17% to $2.4 billion, with 33 Table of Contents / revenue growth in all of our operating segments. During 2023, we generated a substantial majority of our revenue from services and products we provided to the energy industry. Consolidated operating income improved during 2023 as compared to 2022, with a slight decline in our IMDS segment being more than offset by increases in all other segments. We had operating income of $181 million in 2023 and operating income of $111 million in 2022. In 2023, on a consolidated level, we had a net income of $97 million, or diluted earnings of $0.95 per share, compared to net income of $26 million, or diluted earnings of $0.26 per share, in 2022. The increases in 2023 operating income and net income as compared to 2022 were primarily due to higher revenue in all of our segments as a result of increased activity in energy markets and related growth in our energy businesses. All of our segments, except for IMDS, achieved improved sequential annual operating results, led by our Subsea Robotics and Manufactured Products segments. We use our ROVs to provide drill support, vessel-based inspection, maintenance and repair, subsea hardware installation, construction, and pipeline inspection services to customers in the energy industry. Most of our ROVs have historically been used to provide drill support services. Therefore, the contracted number of floating drilling rigs is a leading market indicator for this business. The following table shows average floating rigs under contract and our ROV utilization. 2023 2022 Average number of floating rigs under contract 147 137 ROV days on hire (in thousands) 62 56 ROV utilization 68 % 62 % Demand for floating rigs is a leading indicator of the strength of the deepwater market. According to industry data published by IHS Petrodata, excluding rigs under construction, at the end of 2023 there were 193 floating drilling rigs in operation or available for work throughout the world, with 146 of those rigs under contract. The average contracted offshore floating rig count in 2023 increased to approximately 147 rigs. In addition to floating rig demand, the number of subsea tree orders and installations is another leading indicator and is the primary demand driver for our Manufactured Products lines. According to data published by a world-leading analysis and consultancy company for the energy sector in December 2023, there are projected to be 288 tree awards and 339 subsea tree installations in 2024, compared to 285 tree awards and 370 installations in 2023 and 260 tree awards and 256 installations in 2022. Outlook 2024 financial results are expected to improve year-over-year, based on 2023 year-end backlog and ongoing positive indications from market fundamentals. We are expecting increased operating income in 2024 as compared to 2023 for each of our operating segments, led by Subsea Robotics and OPG. We are expecting sequential improvement in our 2024 operating results as compared to 2023 based on our expectations for continued improvement in pricing and margins in our energy-focused businesses and stable pricing and margins in our government-focused businesses. We expect improved results in our Subsea Robotics segment in 2024 as a result of increased ROV days on hire and continued pricing improvements. Results for tooling-based services are expected to improve, with activity levels generally following ROV days on hire. Survey operating results are expected to improve, with increased activity in geophysical and survey and positioning services. We expect our Manufactured Products segment operating results in 2024 to improve on an increase in revenue, primarily based on 2023 order intake in our energy businesses. We believe that solid bidding activity in our energy businesses will continue during 2024. We are seeing growing prospects to further expand our mobility solutions businesses. Our Manufactured Products backlog was $622 million as of December 31, 2023, a $155 million, or 33%, increase over December 31, 2022. We expect operating results for our OPG segment to improve in 2024 on a modest decrease in revenue. This expectation is based on increased activity levels in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil, as well as improved vessel utilization. We anticipate our 2024 operating results for IMDS to improve slightly on higher revenue, with growth opportunities in digital and engineering services. 34 Table of Contents / We project our ADTech 2024 operating results to be slightly higher on increased revenue as compared to 2023. We anticipate growth in all three of our government-focused businesses. For 2024, we anticipate Unallocated Expenses to average approximately $40 million per quarter. Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices In order to minimize the negative impact of inflation on our operations, we attempt to cover the increased cost of anticipated changes in labor, material and service costs, either through an estimate of those changes, which we reflect in the original price, or through price escalation clauses in our contracts. Our ability to manage inflation going forward is dependent in part on our continued ability to obtain price escalation clauses in our contracts. While the pace of inflation has moderated since 2022, inflation could have a material impact on our results in the future, including if we are unable to reflect such anticipated inflation in the original price. 35 Table of Contents / Results of Operations Additional information on our business segments is shown in Note 10 Operations by Business Segment and Geographic Area in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Energy. The table that follows sets out revenue and profitability for the business segments within our Energy business. In the Subsea Robotics section of the table that follows, ROV Days Available includes all days from the first day that an ROV is placed in service until the ROV is retired. All days in this period are considered available days, including periods when an ROV is undergoing maintenance or repairs. Our ROVs do not have scheduled maintenance or repair that requires significant time when the ROVs are not available for utilization. Year ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Subsea Robotics Revenue $ 752,521 $ 621,921 Gross Margin 221,965 160,527 Gross Margin % 29 % 26 % Operating Income (Loss) 174,293 118,248 Operating Income (Loss)% 23 % 19 % ROV Days Available 91,250 91,250 ROV Days Utilized 61,874 56,231 ROV Utilization % 68 % 62 % Manufactured Products Revenue 493,692 382,361 Gross Margin 69,613 45,834 Gross Margin % 14 % 12 % Operating Income (Loss) 35,551 11,692 Operating Income (Loss)% 7 % 3 % Backlog at end of period 622,000 467,000 Offshore Projects Group Revenue 546,366 489,317 Gross Margin 96,940 78,373 Gross Margin % 18 % 16 % Operating Income (Loss) 64,546 49,256 Operating Income (Loss)% 12 % 10 % Integrity Management & Digital Solutions Revenue 255,282 229,884 Gross Margin 38,988 36,724 Gross Margin % 15 % 16 % Operating Income (Loss) 13,373 14,901 Operating Income (Loss)% 5 % 6 % Total Energy Revenue $ 2,047,861 $ 1,723,483 Gross Margin 427,506 321,458 Gross Margin % 21 % 19 % Operating Income (Loss) 287,763 194,097 Operating Income (Loss)% 14 % 11 % Subsea Robotics. Historically, we built new ROVs to increase the size of our fleet in response to demand to support deepwater drilling and vessel-based IMR and installation work. These vehicles are designed for use around 36 Table of Contents / the world in water depths of 10,000 feet or more. In 2015, as a result of declining market conditions, we began building fewer ROVs, generally limiting additions to meet contractual commitments. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we retired eleven of our conventional work-class ROV systems and replaced them with eleven upgraded conventional work-class ROV systems. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we retired 10 of our conventional work-class ROV systems and replaced them with eight upgraded conventional work-class ROV systems and two Isurus TM work-class ROV systems (which are capable of operating in severe conditions and are ideal for renewables projects and high-speed surveys). We added a total of 11 and 10 in 2023 and 2022, respectively, while retiring 21 units over the two-year period. Our ROV fleet size was 250 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. We believe we are the world's largest provider of work-class ROV services and, generally, this business segment has been the largest contributor to our Energy business operating income. Our Subsea Robotics segment revenue reflects the utilization percentages, fleet sizes and average pricing in the respective periods. Our survey services business provides survey and positioning, and geoscience services. The following table presents revenue from ROV services as a percentage of total Subsea Robotics revenue: Year ended December 31, 2023 2022 ROV 77 % 77 % Other 23 % 23 % For the year ended December 31, 2023, our Subsea Robotics operating income increased as compared to 2022, on higher revenue, as a result of higher levels of activity for ROV, survey and tooling and higher average revenue per day in 2023. We had a 10% increase in days on hire and a year-over-year increase in both drill support and vessel support days. Manufactured Products. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our Manufactured Products operating results increased, as compared to 2022, on higher revenue primarily due to strong order intake in 2022 leading to increased utilization in 2023. Our Manufactured Products backlog was $622 million as of December 31, 2023, a $155 million, or 33%, increase over December 31, 2022. Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.31 for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.39 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Offshore Projects Group. Our OPG operating results for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased as compared to 2022, on higher revenue, primarily due to increased activity levels in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, partially offset by reduced vessel work in the Gulf of Mexico. Integrity Management & Digital Solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022, our IMDS operating results decreased despite higher revenue primarily due to changes in service mix and the costs associated with growth initiatives. Aerospace and Defense Technologies. Revenue, gross margin and operating income information for our ADTech segment are as follows: Year ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Revenue $ 376,845 $ 342,601 Gross Margin 70,420 68,447 Gross Margin % 19 % 20 % Operating Income 45,003 44,168 Operating Income % 12 % 13 % For the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022, our ADTech segment operating results were slightly higher on increased levels of revenue primarily due to increased activity in all of our government-focused businesses. 37 Table of Contents / Unallocated Expenses. Our unallocated expenses, ( i.e. , those not associated with a specific business segment), within gross margin consist of expenses related to our incentive and deferred compensation plans, including restricted stock units, performance units and bonuses, as well as other general expenses. Our unallocated expenses within operating expenses consist of those expenses within gross margin plus general and administrative expenses related to corporate functions. The following table sets forth our Unallocated Expenses for the periods indicated: Year ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Gross margin expenses $ (98,955) $ (82,528) % of revenue 4 % 4 % Operating expenses (151,438) (127,402) % of revenue 6 % 6 % Our unallocated expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased compared to 2022, primarily due to higher accruals in 2023 for incentive-based compensation along with increased information technology costs. Other. The following table sets forth our significant financial statement items below the income (loss) from operations line: Year ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Interest income $ 15,425 $ 5,708 Interest expense (36,523) (38,215) Equity earnings (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates 2,061 1,707 Other income (expense), net (1,236) (1,011) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 63,652 53,111 Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 2022, increased primarily due to higher interest rates and increased average amounts of cash invested. In addition to interest on borrowings, interest expense includes amortization of loan costs and interest rate swap settlements, fees for lender commitments under our senior secured revolving credit agreement and fees for standby letters of credit and bank guarantees that banks issue on our behalf for performance bonds, bid bonds and self-insurance requirements. Interest expense was lower in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 2022, as a result of a decrease in the aggregate principal balance outstanding of our long-term senior notes from $700 million to $500 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. We repurchased $312 million and $88 million in October and November 2023, respectively, of aggregate principal amounts for the 4.650% Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Senior Notes ), partially offset by a private placement of $200 million aggregate principal amount of additional 2028 Senior Notes (defined below). We have not capitalized interest since 2019 and do not anticipate capitalizing interest on any long-lived assets in 2024. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are the principal component of other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2023. In the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of $(1.4) million and less than $(0.1) million, respectively. The currency gains (losses) in 2023 were primarily related to increasing (declining) exchange rates for the Angolan kwanza relative to the United States ( U.S. ) dollar. We could incur further foreign currency exchange gains (losses) in Angola and in other countries due to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Our tax provision is based on (1) our earnings for the period and other factors affecting the tax provision and (2) the operations of foreign branches and subsidiaries that are subject to local income and withholding taxes. Factors that affect our tax rate include our profitability levels in general and the geographical mix of our results. The effective tax rate for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was different than the federal statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to the geographical mix of revenue and earnings, changes in valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions, and other discrete items. We do not believe a comparison of the effective tax rate for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, is meaningful. We continue to make an assertion to 38 Table of Contents / indefinitely reinvest the unrepatriated earnings of any foreign subsidiary that would incur material tax consequences upon the distribution of such earnings. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, we received refunds of $23 million, under the U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ), including interest of $1.7 million which was recorded as a tax benefit. The outstanding refund of $20 million was classified as other noncurrent assets, in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. We establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. Based on the available positive and negative evidence, including historical and forecasted earnings, we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in several non-U.S. jurisdictions will be realized. Accordingly, during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, we partially released valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets that we believe are more likely than not to be realized. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the valuation allowance decreased by $21 million in 2023 and increased by $6.0 million in 2022. Our income tax payments for the full year of 2024 are estimated to be in the range of $80 million to $90 million, which includes taxes incurred in countries that impose tax on the basis of in-country revenue, without regard to the profitability of such operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources We consider our liquidity and capital resources adequate to support our operations, capital commitments and strategic growth initiatives. Our ability to generate substantial cash flow over the last several years has allowed us to reduce our long-term debt balance while maintaining a strong liquidity position. Our material cash commitments consist primarily of obligations for long-term debt, purchase obligations as part of normal operations, and operating leases for land, buildings, vessels and equipment for the operation of our business and to support some of our service line revenue streams. Our purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods and services as well as commitments for capital assets used in the normal operations of our business. We are committed to maintaining strong liquidity and believe that our cash position, undrawn Revolving Credit Agreement (as defined below), and long-term debt maturity profile provide us with ample resources and time to address our liquidity needs, including potential future growth opportunities and working capital needs. As of December 31, 2023, we had working capital of $573 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $462 million. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, we had $215 million of unused commitments through our senior secured revolving credit agreement that we entered into in April 2022 (as amended by an Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement, dated September 20, 2023, the Revolving Credit Agreement ), which is further described below and in Note 8 Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Availability under the $215 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ) may be limited by certain financial covenants and the requirement that any borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility not require the granting of any liens to secure any senior notes issued by us ( Senior Notes ). The indenture governing the 2028 Senior Notes (defined below) generally limits our ability to incur secured debt for borrowed money (such as borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) to 15% of our Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as defined in such indentures). Our nearest maturity of indebtedness is $500 million of our 2028 Senior Notes (defined below). As of December 31, 2023, we had $476 million of purchase obligations including $463 million payable within the next twelve months and $13 million thereafter. For more on our operating leases for land, buildings, vessels and equipment for the operation of our business and their scheduled maturities, see Note 4 Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. From time to time, we may engage in certain transactions in order to manage our outstanding debt prior to maturity, including by engaging in repurchases via open-market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, redemptions, exchanges, tender offers or otherwise. For instance, in 2021, we repurchased $100 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Senior Notes in open-market transactions. On October 2, 2023, we repurchased $312 million principal amount of the 2024 Senior Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest of $5.5 million for approximately $318 million in the Tender Offer (as defined below), and pursuant to our optional redemption right under the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Notes, we redeemed all of the remaining $88 million principal amount outstanding of the 2024 Senior Notes at par on November 2, 2023 (the Redemption Date ), which we financed with cash on hand. See Financing Activities and Note 8 Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information on the Tender Offer (as defined below), the 39 Table of Contents / redemption of the 2024 Senior Notes and the scheduled maturities of our long-term debt. We can provide no assurances as to the timing of any future repurchases or whether we will complete any repurchases at all. Changes impacting our cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are summarized as follows: Year ended December 31, (in thousands) 2023 2022 Changes in Cash: Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 209,955 $ 120,883 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities (86,353) (76,865) Net Cash Used in Financing Activities (227,297) (1,862) Effect of exchange rates on cash (3,484) (11,525) Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ (107,179) $ 30,631 Operating activities. Our primary sources and uses of cash from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows: Year ended December 31, (in thousands) 2023 2022 Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Net income (loss) $ 97,403 $ 25,941 Noncash adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 104,960 120,969 Deferred income tax provision (benefit) (26,785) 829 Other noncash 13,415 7,713 Total noncash adjustments 91,590 129,511 Accounts receivable and contract assets (83,075) (50,732) Inventory (25,423) (30,692) Current liabilities 125,695 67,253 Other changes 3,765 (20,398) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 209,955 $ 120,883 Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 of $210 million and $121 million, respectively, was affected by the following: Accounts receivable and contract assets - The decrease in cash related to accounts receivable and contract assets in 2023 and 2022 reflects the increase in accounts receivable corresponding with the increase in revenue as compared to the prior year, along with the timing of project milestones and customer payments. Inventory - The decrease in cash related to inventory in 2023 and 2022 corresponds with an increase in our backlog along with the impact of higher inflation in 2023 and 2022. Current liabilities - The increase in cash related to current liabilities in 2023 and 2022 reflects the timing of vendor payments and increased contract liabilities due to an increase in deferred customer prepayments. Investing activities. In 2023, we used $86 million in net investing activities, primarily for capital expenditures of $101 million that included increased spending in our Subsea Robotics segment for ROV upgrades and replacements. In 2022, we used $77 million in net investing activities, primarily for capital expenditures of $81 million that included increased spending in our Subsea Robotics segment for ROV upgrades and replacements and other increased capital expenditures for information technology systems. Our capital expenditures during 2023 and 2022 included $67 million and $56 million, respectively, in our Subsea Robotics segment, principally for upgrades to our ROV fleet and to replace certain units we retired. We currently plan to add new ROVs only to meet contractual commitments. In 2023, we retired eleven of our conventional work- 40 Table of Contents / class ROV systems and replaced them with eleven upgraded conventional work-class ROV systems. In 2022, we retired 10 of our conventional work-class ROVs and replaced them with eight upgraded conventional work-class ROV systems and two Isurus TM work-class ROV systems (which are capable of operating in severe conditions and are ideal for renewables projects and high-speed surveys). Our ROV fleet size was 250 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Additionally, our newest development is Freedom , a hybrid autonomous underwater vehicle ( AUV ) and ROV that can complete surveys, commissioning, inspections, maintenance, and repairs without the need for a pilot to monitor and control the entire operation. These outlays were partially offset in 2023 by $7.8 million of proceeds received from the sale of various assets and $6.2 million from the sale of the remainder of our Angolan bonds and in 2022 by $6.5 million of proceeds received from the sale of various assets. We have several deepwater vessels under a mix of short-term charters where we can see firm workload and spot charters as market opportunities arise. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2023, we entered into three new long-term charters for deepwater vessels, two of which began in the third and fourth quarters of 2023 and the other that will begin in the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, we have four long-term charters that began in 2022. With the current market conditions, we may add additional chartered vessels throughout the year to align with our strategy that balances vessel cost, availability and capability to capture work. We expect to do this through the continued utilization of a mix of short-term, spot and long-term charters. In 2024, we expect our organic capital expenditures to total between $110 million and $130 million, exclusive of business acquisitions, which we expect to fund using our available cash, as compared to capital expenditures of $101 million in 2023. We remain committed to maintaining strong liquidity and believe that our cash position, undrawn revolving credit facility, and debt maturity profile should provide us ample resources and time to address potential future growth opportunities and to improve our returns. Financing activities. In 2023 we used $227 million of cash in financing activities primarily due to payment of $400 million outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Senior Notes, partially offset by receipt of $178 million in net proceeds from the offering of the New 2028 Senior Notes (defined below). In 2023 and 2022, we used $5.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively, of cash in financing activities primarily due to payment of tax withholding related to vesting of stock awards. Our total interest costs, including commitment fees for the Revolving Credit Facility, were $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we had long-term debt in the principal amount of $500 million outstanding and $215 million of unused commitments under our Revolving Credit Agreement. On September 20, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Revolving Credit Agreement which extended the maturity of the commitments thereunder to April 8, 2027. As of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all the covenants set forth in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Agreement. We have not guaranteed any debt not reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by SEC rules. 2024 Senior Notes. In November 2014, we completed the public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.650% Senior Notes due 2024. We paid interest on the 2024 Senior Notes on May 15 and November 15 of each year. While the 2024 Senior Notes were scheduled to mature on November 15, 2024, prior to such maturity we repurchased $312 million principal amount of the 2024 Senior Notes on October 2, 2023, in the Tender Offer (as defined below), and we redeemed all of the remaining $88 million principal amount outstanding of the 2024 Senior Notes at par on the Redemption Date, November 2, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, there were no 2024 Senior Notes outstanding. We had two interest rate swaps in place relating to a total of $200 million of the 2024 Senior Notes for the period to November 2024. In March 2020, we settled both interest rate swaps with the counterparty for cash proceeds of $13 million. The settlement resulted in a $13 million increase to our long-term debt balance that was being amortized as a reduction to interest expense prospectively through the maturity date for the 2024 Senior Notes using the effective interest method. Upon retirement of the 2024 Senior Notes, we wrote off the related unamortized interest rate swaps and debt issuance cost balances. We amortized $4.4 million to interest expense, including $2.7 million for the pro-rata write-off of interest rate swap settlement gains associated with the 2024 Senior Notes repurchases discussed above, for the year ended December 31, 2023. We amortized $2.2 million to interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 8 Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for a description of these interest rate swaps. 41 Table of Contents / 2028 Senior Notes. In February 2018, we completed the public offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2028 (the Existing 2028 Senior Notes ). We pay interest on the Existing 2028 Senior Notes on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The Existing 2028 Senior Notes are scheduled to mature on February 1, 2028. We may redeem some or all of the Existing 2028 Senior Notes at specified redemption prices. On October 2, 2023, we completed a private placement of $200 million aggregate principal amount of additional 2028 Senior Notes (the New 2028 Senior Notes and, together with the Existing 2028 Senior Notes, the 2028 Senior Notes ) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S Under the Securities Act. The New 2028 Senior Notes constitute an additional issuance of the Existing 2028 Senior Notes and form a single series with such notes. We will pay interest on the New 2028 Senior Notes on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing on February 1, 2024. The New 2028 Senior Notes are scheduled to mature on February 1, 2028. We may redeem some or all of the New 2028 Senior Notes at specified redemption prices. We received net proceeds from the offering of the New 2028 Senior Notes of $178 million, after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2023, there was $500 million of the 2028 Senior Notes outstanding. On October 2, 2023, we used the net proceeds from the offering discussed above, together with cash on hand, to fund our offer to purchase (the Tender Offer ) for cash any and all of the $400 million principal amount outstanding of the 2024 Senior Notes. We repurchased $312 million principal amount of the 2024 Senior Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest of $5.5 million for approximately $318 million. The consummation of the Tender Offer was contingent upon the completion of the offering discussed above, which was satisfied on October 2, 2023. We redeemed all of the remaining $88 million principal amount outstanding of the 2024 Senior Notes at par on the Redemption Date, November 2, 2023, and financed with cash on hand. Revolving Credit Agreement. On April 8, 2022, we entered into a new senior secured revolving credit agreement with a group of banks (as amended by an Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement, dated September 20, 2023, the Revolving Credit Agreement. The commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement are scheduled to mature on April 8, 2027, or alternatively, if our Liquidity (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) is less than $175 million as of August 16, 2024, then on such date (which is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2024 Notes that were no longer outstanding as of November 2, 2023). In connection with entering into the Revolving Credit Agreement, we terminated our $500 million five-year revolving credit facility entered into in October 2014 (the Prior Revolving Credit Facility ). No borrowings were outstanding under the Prior Revolving Credit Facility. We repaid all accrued fees and expenses in connection with the termination of the Prior Revolving Credit Facility and all commitments thereunder were terminated. No early termination penalties were incurred in connection with the termination of the Prior Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes a $215 million revolving credit facility, the Revolving Credit Facility, with a $100 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Our obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries and are secured by first priority liens on certain of our assets and those of the guarantors, including, among other things, intellectual property, inventory, accounts receivable, equipment and equity interests in subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and no letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement. We may borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility at either (1) a base rate, determined as the greatest of (A) the prime rate of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, (B) the federal funds effective rate plus 1 2 of 1% and (C) Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ( SOFR ) (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement for a one-month tenor plus 1%, in each case plus the applicable margin, which varies from 1.25% to 2.25% depending on our Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement), or (2) Adjusted Term SOFR plus the applicable margin, which varies from 2.25% to 3.25% depending on our Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio. We will also pay a facility fee based on the amount of the underlying commitment that is being utilized, which fee varies from 0.300% to 0.375%, with the higher rate owed when we use the Revolving Credit Facility less. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes financial covenants that are tested on a quarterly basis, based on the rolling four-quarter period that ends on the last day of each fiscal quarter. The maximum permitted Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is initially 4.00 to 1.00 and will decrease to 3.25 to 1.00 during the term of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2023, the maximum permitted Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio was 3.25 to 1.00 and will not change during the remaining term of the Revolving Credit Facility. The minimum Consolidated Interest 42 Table of Contents / Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) is 3.00 to 1.00 throughout the term of the Revolving Credit Facility. Availability under the Revolving Credit Facility may be limited by these financial covenants and the requirement that any borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility not require the granting of any liens to secure any senior notes issued by us ( Senior Notes ). The indentures governing the 2028 Senior Notes, generally limit our ability to incur secured debt for borrowed money (such as borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) to 15% of our Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as defined in such indentures). As of December 31, 2023, the full $215 million was available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are customary for agreements of this nature, including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability and the ability of each of our subsidiaries to incur debt, grant liens, make certain investments, make distributions, merge or consolidate, sell assets and enter into certain restrictive agreements. As of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all the covenants set forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement. Debt Issuance Costs. We incurred $6.9 million of issuance costs related to the 2024 Senior Notes. These costs, net of accumulated amortization, are included as a reduction of long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and were amortized to interest expense through the maturity date. In the year ended December 31, 2023, we amortized $1.3 million to interest expense, including $0.7 million for the write-off of the debt issuance balance associated with the retirement of the 2024 Senior Notes discussed above. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we amortized $0.7 million to interest expense. We incurred $7.0 million of issuance costs related to the 2028 Senior Notes and $4.0 million of loan costs related to the Revolving Credit Agreement. These costs, net of accumulated amortization, are included as a reduction of long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as they pertain to the 2028 Senior Notes, and in other noncurrent assets as they pertain to the Revolving Credit Agreement. We are amortizing these costs to interest expense through the respective maturity dates for the Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Agreement using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest rate method. As a result, we amortized $1.6 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Share Repurchase Program. In December 2014, our Board of Directors approved a plan to repurchase up to 10 million shares of our common stock on a discretionary basis. The program calls for any repurchases to be made in the open market, or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market and business conditions, levels of available liquidity, cash requirements for other purposes, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Under this program, in 2015, we repurchased 2.0 million shares of our common stock for $100 million. We have not repurchased any shares under the program since December 2015. As of December 31, 2023, we retained 10 million of the shares we had repurchased through this and a prior repurchase program. We account for the shares we hold in treasury under the cost method, at average cost. The timing and amount of any future repurchases will be determined by our management. We expect that any additional shares repurchased under the plan will be held as treasury stock for possible future use. The plan does not obligate us to repurchase any particular number of shares. Foreign Currency Adjustments. Because of our significant foreign operations, we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks. A stronger U.S. dollar against any of the foreign currencies where we conduct business could result in lower operating income. We generally minimize these risks primarily through matching, to the extent possible, revenue and expense in the various currencies in which we operate. Cumulative translation adjustments as of December 31, 2023 relate primarily to our net investments in, including long-term loans to, our foreign subsidiaries. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have based the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These principles require us to make various estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods we present. We base our estimates on historical experience, available information and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates; however, our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following discussion summarizes the accounting policies we believe (1) require our management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and (2) are the most critical to our reporting of results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for discussion of our significant accounting policies. 43 Table of Contents / Revenue Recognition. We account for significant fixed-price contracts, mainly relating to our Manufactured Products segment, and to a lesser extent in our OPG and ADTech segments, by recognizing revenue over time using the cost-to-cost input method to measure progress toward satisfaction of an over-time performance obligation. This commonly used method is based on the premise that costs incurred are proportionate to progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation and is measured by comparing project costs-to-date to total estimated costs. The performance obligation is satisfied as we create a product on behalf of the customer over the life of the contract. We apply judgment in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized approximately 19% of our revenue over time using the cost-to-cost input method. We apply judgment in the determination and allocation of transaction price to performance obligations, and the subsequent recognition of revenue, based on the facts and circumstances of each contract. We routinely review estimates related to our contracts and, where required, reflect revisions to profitability in earnings immediately. If an element of variable consideration has the potential for a significant future reversal of revenue, we will constrain that variable consideration to a level intended to remove the potential future reversal. If a current estimate of total contract cost indicates an ultimate loss on a contract, we recognize the projected loss in full when we determine it. We did not have any material adjustments during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, however, should our judgments and estimates regarding the elements of revenue recognition change, it could have a material effect on our results of operations for the periods involved. Impairment of Property and Equipment, Long-lived Intangible Assets and Right-of-Use Operating Lease Assets. We periodically, and upon the occurrence of a triggering event, review the realizability of our property and equipment, long-lived intangible assets and right-of-use operating lease assets to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets to be held and used, we base our evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets, the future economic benefits of the assets, any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present. If such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, we determine whether an impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flows analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. If an impairment has occurred, we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Our estimates of fair values for our asset groups require us to use significant unobservable inputs, classified as Level 3 fair value measurements, including assumptions related to future performance, risk-adjusted discount rates, future commodity prices and demand for our services and estimates of expected realizable value. These assumptions incorporate inherent uncertainties, including estimates of projected supply and demand for our products and services and future market conditions, which are subjective and difficult to predict due to volatility in overall economic environments, among other things, and could result in impairment charges in future periods if actual results differ materially from the assumptions used in our forecasts. Also, if market conditions deteriorate significantly, we could be required to record additional impairments, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. We did not identify any triggering events and, accordingly, no impairments of long-lived assets were recorded in the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022. Income Taxes. Our tax provisions are based on our expected taxable income, statutory rates and tax-planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws. We are at risk that a taxing authority's final determination of our tax liabilities may differ from our interpretation. We account for any applicable interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of our provision for income taxes on our financial statements. Current income tax expense represents either nonresident withholding taxes or the liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year, while the net deferred income tax expense or benefit generally represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities, except for currency translation adjustments, as reported on our balance sheet. We establish valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. If the current market dynamics are sustained and absent any additional objective negative evidence, we may have sufficient positive evidence in the next twelve months to adjust our valuation allowance position for certain jurisdictions. The exact timing and amount of the 44 Table of Contents / adjustment to the valuation allowance is not certain at this time. Changes to valuation allowances impact our income tax provision in the period in which such adjustments are identified and recorded. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2023, we had payments due under contractual obligations as follows: (dollars in thousands) Payments due by period Total 2024 2025-2026 2027-2028 After 2028 Long-term Debt $ 500,000 $ $ $ 500,000 $ Purchase Obligations 476,142 462,677 8,579 4,438 448 Operating Lease Liabilities 459,555 97,549 158,408 59,232 144,366 Other Long-term Obligations reflected on our Balance Sheet under U.S. GAAP 40,305 116 281 361 39,547 TOTAL $ 1,476,002 $ 560,342 $ 167,268 $ 564,031 $ 184,361 45 Table of Contents /
