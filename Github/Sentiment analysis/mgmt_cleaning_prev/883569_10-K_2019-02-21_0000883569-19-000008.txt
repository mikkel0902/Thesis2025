Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary We are a global design, marketing and distribution company that specializes in consumer fashion accessories. Our principal offerings include an extensive line of men's and women's fashion watches and jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, belts, and sunglasses. In the watch and jewelry product categories, we have a diverse portfolio of globally recognized owned and licensed brand names under which our products are marketed. Our products are distributed globally through various distribution channels including wholesale in countries where we have a physical presence, direct to the consumer through our retail stores and commercial websites and through third-party distributors in countries where we do not maintain a physical presence. Our products are offered at varying price points to meet the needs of our customers, whether they are value-conscious or luxury oriented. Based on our extensive range of accessory products, brands, distribution channels and price points, we are able to target style-conscious consumers across a wide age spectrum on a global basis. Domestically, we sell our products through a diversified distribution network that includes department stores, specialty retail locations, specialty watch and jewelry stores, Company-owned retail and outlet stores, mass market stores, through our FOSSIL website and third party websites. Our wholesale customer base includes, among others, Amazon, Best Buy, Dillard's, JCPenney, Kohl's, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Target and Wal-Mart. In the U.S., our network of Company-owned stores included 63 retail stores located in premier retail sites and 113 outlet stores located in major outlet malls as of December 29, 2018 . In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products on our website, www.fossil.com , as well as proprietary and licensed watch and jewelry brands through other managed and affiliated websites. Internationally, our products are sold to department stores, specialty retail stores, specialty watch and jewelry stores and through third party websites in approximately 150 countries worldwide through 23 Company-owned foreign sales subsidiaries and through a network of approximately 70 independent distributors. Internationally, our network of Company-owned stores included 181 retail stores and 127 outlet stores as of December 29, 2018 . Our products are also sold through licensed and franchised FOSSIL retail stores, retail concessions operated by us and kiosks in certain international markets. In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products on our websites in certain countries. Our consolidated gross profit margin is impacted by our diversified business model that includes, but is not limited to: (i) a significant number of product categories we distribute, (ii) the multiple brands we offer within several product categories, (iii) the geographical presence of our businesses and (iv) the different distribution channels we sell to or through. The components of this diversified business model produce varying ranges of gross profit margin. Generally, on a historical basis, our fashion branded watch and jewelry offerings produce higher gross profit margins than our leather goods offerings. In addition, in most product categories that we offer, brands with higher retail price points generally produce higher gross profit margins compared to those of lower retail priced brands and connected products carry relatively lower margins than traditional products. Gross profit margins related to sales in our Europe and Asia businesses are historically higher than our Americas business, primarily due to the following factors: (i) premiums charged in comparison to retail prices on products sold in the U.S.; (ii) the product sales mix in our international businesses, in comparison to our Americas business, is comprised more predominantly of watches and jewelry that generally produce higher gross profit margins than leather goods; and (iii) the watch sales mix in our Europe and Asia businesses, in comparison to our Americas business, are comprised more predominantly of higher priced licensed brands. Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing supply. Certain key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, which exposes us to potential supply shortages that could disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products. Any interruption or delay in the supply of key components could significantly harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and cause us to lose sales. Interruptions or delays in supply may be caused by a number of factors that are outside of our and our contractor manufacturers' control. Effective for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we made changes to the presentation of reportable segments to reflect changes in the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our operations, develops strategy, and allocates capital resources. Certain peripheral revenue generating activities related to our factories and intellectual property previously recorded within the Americas, Asia and Europe segments have been reclassified to Corporate. For comparison purposes, our historical segment disclosures have been recast to be consistent with the current presentation. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included therewith. 26 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to product returns, bad debt, inventories, long-lived asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and trade names, income taxes, warranty costs and litigation liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant estimates and judgments. Product Returns. We accept limited returns and may request that a customer return a product if we feel the customer has an excess of any style that we have identified as being a poor performer for that customer or geographic location. We monitor returns and maintain a provision for estimated returns based upon historical experience and any specific issues identified. While returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past. In the event that our products are performing poorly in the retail market and/or we experience product damages or defects at a rate significantly higher than our historical rate, the resulting returns could have an adverse impact on the operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur. If our allowance for product returns were to change by 10%, the impact, excluding taxes, would have been an approximate $3.5 million change to net income (loss). Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, including any applicable duty and freight charges. We account for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the average cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand, market conditions and available liquidation channels. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if liquidation channels are not readily available, additional inventory valuation reductions may be required. We assess our off-price sales on an ongoing basis and update our estimates accordingly. Revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers, delivery has occurred and in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for the product. Impairment of Goodwill and Trade Names. In fiscal year 2017, we determined goodwill was fully impaired and recognized a pre-tax impairment charge in operations of $202.3 million, $114.3 million and $42.9 million in the Americas, Europe and Asia segments, respectively. We evaluate indefinite-lived trade names by comparing the fair value of the asset to its recorded value annually as of the end of the fiscal year and whenever events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of the trade name may not be recoverable. The fair value of the asset is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies. For fiscal year 2018, a discount rate of 12% and a royalty rate of 3% were used to estimate the SKAGEN trade name fair value. For fiscal year 2018, a discount rate of 11% and a royalty rate of 4.5% were used to estimate the MICHELE trade name fair value. The SKAGEN trade name represented approximately 66% of our total trade name balance at the end of fiscal year 2018 , 71% at the end of fiscal year 2017 and 63% at the end of fiscal year 2016 . The MICHELE trade name represented approximately 34% of our total trade name balances at the end of fiscal year 2018 , 29% at the end of fiscal year 2017 and 21% at the end of fiscal year 2016 . In fiscal year 2018 , as a result of interim impairment testing, we recorded impairment charges of $6.2 million related to the SKAGEN trade name, and no impairment charges were recorded to the MICHELE trade name. In fiscal year 2017 , we recorded impairment charges of $28.3 million and $7.6 million related to the SKAGEN and the MICHELE trade names, respectively. In fiscal year 2016 , no impairment charges were recorded related to the SKAGEN or MICHELE trade names. As of December 29, 2018 , the fair value of the SKAGEN trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 6%, and the fair value of the MICHELE trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 24%. The MISFIT trade name was being amortized over its estimated useful life; however, during fiscal year 2017, the trade name was deemed not recoverable, resulting in an impairment charge of $11.8 million . The MISFIT trade name represented approximately 15% of our total trade name balance at the end of fiscal year 2016. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value analysis, actual results may differ, which could alter the fair value of the trade names and possibly cause impairment charges to occur in future periods. Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimate of future cash flows used to determine the estimate of the reporting unit's fair value. The most significant assumptions associated with the fair value calculations include net sales growth 27 Table of Contents rates and discount rates. If the actual future sales results do not meet the assumed growth rates, future impairments of trade names may be incurred. Property, Plant and Equipment Impairment. We test for asset impairment of property, plant and equipment assets whenever events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, we calculate fair value using our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. When undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated through the operations of our Company-owned retail stores are less than the carrying value of the underlying assets, the assets are impaired. If it is determined that assets are impaired, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the asset's book value exceeds its fair value. Should actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated, additional losses may be recorded. We recorded impairment losses in restructuring charges of approximately $1.7 million , $8.0 million and $13.5 million in fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. We recorded impairment losses in selling, general, and administrative expenses of approximately $1.9 million , $1.3 million and $0.8 million in fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. In fiscal year 2018 , an increase of 100 basis points to the discount rate used in our impairment testing would not have resulted in additional impairment expense. A 10% decrease in future expected cash flows would have increased impairment expense by $0.3 million. We recorded non-impairment restructuring charges related to the write off of property, plant and equipment of approximately $0.6 million , $0.4 million and $1.5 million in fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. I ncome Taxes. We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740"). Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. The valuation allowance for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $95.8 million, $78.3 million, and $19.4 million, respectively. In addition, in fiscal year 2018, we recorded a state deferred tax liability of $0.5 million on foreign earnings not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. Our continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. We accrue an amount for our estimate of additional income tax liability which we believe we are more likely than not to incur as a result of the ultimate resolution of tax audits ("uncertain tax positions"). We review and update the estimates used in the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities, upon completion of tax audits, upon expiration of statutes of limitation, or upon occurrence of other events. The results of operations and financial position for future periods could be impacted by changes in assumptions or resolutions of tax audits. The new Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ( GILTI ) provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") requiring the inclusion of certain foreign earnings in U.S. taxable income increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 and could have an adverse impact in future years. Due to the complexity of these new tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate these provisions of the Tax Act as the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and the U.S. Treasury Department ("Treasury") issue guidance and regulations. The GILTI impact will be accounted for as incurred under the period cost method. Accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act requires significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation and calculations of the provisions of the Tax Act. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for fiscal year 2017 as permitted under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, ( SAB 118 ) Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , which provides guidance on accounting for the Tax Act impact. Additional guidance was subsequently issued by Treasury and the IRS, particularly with regard to the one-time repatriation tax on deferred foreign earnings. During fiscal 2018, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act and made adjustments to the provisional amounts. In addition, our valuation allowance analysis is affected by various aspects of the Tax Act, including the new limitation on the deductibility of interest expense and the impact of the GILTI. Those adjustments materially impacted the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in fiscal 2018. Warranty Costs. Our watch products are covered by limited warranties against defects in materials or workmanship. Historically, our FOSSIL and RELIC watch products sold in the U.S. have been covered for warranty periods of 11 years and 12 years, respectively, and our SKAGEN branded watches have been covered by a lifetime warranty. Beginning in 2017, these brands are covered by a two year warranty. Generally, all other products, including leathers and jewelry, sold in the U.S. and internationally are covered by a comparable one to two year warranty. We determine our warranty liability using historical warranty repair experience. As changes occur in sales volumes and warranty costs, the warranty accrual is adjusted as necessary. Due to the nature of connected products, their warranty costs are usually more than traditional products. A shift in 28 Table of Contents product mix from traditional to connected products generally results in an increase in warranty liabilities. The year-end warranty liability for fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $22.8 million , $19.4 million and $15.4 million , respectively. Results of Operations Executive Summary Our approach for fiscal 2018 was to plan our sales prudently, but operate all elements of our business with the goal of improving profitability. During fiscal year 2018 , net sales decreased 9% ( 10% in constant currency) as compared to fiscal year 2017. The watch and accessory business is changing at a rapid pace around the globe, and we are on a multi-year journey to transform our Company. Consumer preferences and shopping patterns continue to shift. Product innovation, particularly in watches, has expanded the category overall, but has caused a move away from traditional product to connected watches. Marketing, product information and consumer research on watches and fashion accessories are shifting from our traditional brick and mortar channels to online sites. With our focus on profitability, we are exiting marginal businesses, closing underperforming store locations, and as previously announced, we have terminated certain licensing agreements. These exits and store closures had a negative impact on net sales year-over-year, reducing fiscal year 2018 net sales by approximately 490 basis points when compared to fiscal year 2017, while improving overall profitability. We also continued to make progress strengthening our overall financial position and our capital structure, as we improved the efficiency of our working capital, with particular focus on inventory productivity and turnover. We have four overall objectives driving our strategies and initiatives. Our first and most important priority this past year was to improve our profitability and our financial condition. Due to structural changes in the watch and accessory categories, we recognized the need to be highly focused on our overall profitability, which meant, at times, exiting less profitable parts of our business, such as unprofitable stores, businesses and product lines. During fiscal year 2018 our sales decreased, but our actions drove dramatic improvements in profitability, as operating income, excluding non-cash intangible asset impairment charges and restructuring, increased significantly as compared to fiscal year 2017. Our New World Fossil ("NWF") initiatives continue to contribute significantly to our profit improvement efforts through a combination of pricing programs, direct and indirect sourcing efforts and organizational efficiency initiatives. Since we began the NWF program late in fiscal year 2016, we have been pleased with the Company's efforts and remain on track to achieve our NWF objectives. Our second key objective was to continue to focus on innovation and design in the watch category. In traditional watches, we used bold color and designs as a way to capture the consumer attention. Our black-out approach for FOSSIL brand, strong color offerings for SKAGEN, and striking design statements in DIESEL drove improvements in sales trends and demonstrated the impact that newness can bring to the traditional category. In connected watches, our new Gen4 product with heart rate monitoring, GPS, and Google Pay sold at higher rates than Gen3 product in both direct and indirect channels. Our new FOSSIL sport offering generated strong sales on limited availability. This watch has the latest Qualcomm 3100 chip which has improved battery life and faster processing. Our connected product represented 20% of our total watch sales in 2018, with our America region reaching 22%. For FOSSIL brand, wearables were 28% of total brand watch sales for 2018, and exceeded 30% in our America region. Our third key strategy was to invest in digital marketing and expand our efforts in e-commerce, particularly for our FOSSIL brand. We continue to focus our media mix on digital, investing in digital channels, including social media, digital media and paid search. We continue to enhance our consumer targeting and social content initiatives to further improve engagement while driving product sales through search, affiliates and re-targeting efforts. Social influencers remain a critical part of our marketing program and include celebrity influencers and brand ambassadors. As a result of our efforts and the success of these programs, unique visitors to our sites continue to increase, and our own e-commerce platforms continue to drive comparable sales growth. We will continue to generate strong brand moments online to build momentum and awareness. Our fourth key initiative was the business model transformation work under our NWF initiatives. This is our ongoing comprehensive program to reinvent our Company to address changing consumer trends, drive efficiencies and speed throughout the organization, streamline the way we work, enhance our margins and ultimately drive significantly improved economics to the bottom line. We remain on track to achieve our NWF objective of $200 million in run rate savings by the end of 2019. During fiscal year 2018, sales of FOSSIL branded products decreased 6% (7% in constant currency), as compared to fiscal year 2017, with declines across all product categories. FOSSIL brand watch sales decreased 4% (same in constant currency) during fiscal year 2018, driven mainly by the closure of underperforming stores and significant declines in the traditional wholesale business in Europe. Our connected business continued to gain traction, positively impacting the category growth rate by approximately 9% on a constant currency basis. Our FOSSIL brand performance benefited from our marketing efforts, store experience and celebrity influencer campaigns in our full price stores and our own e-commerce sites. Sales decreases in our outlet stores, driven by a reduction in promotional activity to increase profitability, drove the overall decrease in our total direct channel. 29 Table of Contents Our multi-brand global watch portfolio declined 8% (same in constant currency) during fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, as growth in connected watches was more than offset by continued traditional watch sales declines in our Americas and Europe wholesale channels. Fiscal year 2018 sales were also negatively impacted by the BURBERRY and ADIDAS licensed brand exits. Sales trends of our traditional watches remained soft during fiscal year 2018 in both the Americas and Europe, and we experienced some connected inventory delays during our important holiday season. Sales increases in ARMANI watches, driven by a strong performance in Asia, were offset by declines in most other brands. MICHAEL KORS watch sales decreased 5% (same in constant currency) with decreases in all segments. We continued to grow our connected watch business, delivering $395 million in sales, representing 19% of total watch sales for fiscal year 2018 and an increase of 32% over fiscal year 2017. Global comparable retail sales, including our stores and our own e-commerce, declined 2% for fiscal year 2018 with sales declines across all product categories. Comparable sales decreases were driven by our outlet stores as a result of reduced promotional activity to increase profitability, partially offset by both strong sales growth in e-commerce and improved store conversion. During fiscal year 2018, our gross profit margin rate increased 400 basis points to 52.7% compared to 48.7% in the prior fiscal year, driven in part by a favorable comparison against an inventory valuation reserve primarily for excess levels of connected products recorded in fiscal year 2017, lower promotional activity and markdowns and favorable product mix. Gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by approximately 80 basis points due to currency movements, as well as benefits from NWF driven by direct sourcing and design to value initiatives. Other income (expense) decreased unfavorably primarily due to net foreign currency losses during fiscal year 2018 as compared to net gains in fiscal year 2017. During fiscal year 2018, our financial performance resulted in a net loss of $0.07 per diluted share and included NWF restructuring charges of $0.75 per diluted share and non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $0.10 per diluted share. During fiscal year 2017, our financial performance resulted in a loss of $9.87 per diluted share, including non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $7.07 per diluted share, tax charges resulting from the Tax Act and valuation allowances of $2.20 per diluted share and restructuring charges of $0.65 per diluted share. Currencies, including both the translation impact on operating earnings and the impact of foreign currency hedging contracts, favorably impacted the earnings comparison for fiscal year 2018 by $0.09 per diluted share. As we look at 2019, our focus and priorities will remain consistent with the past year; however, we will pivot appropriately to address the changing landscape. One priority that will not change is our focus on improving our profitability as well as strengthening our financial position to ensure the long-term success of the Company. Also, product innovation and differentiation are more important than ever, in both connected and traditional products. We will endeavor to maximize sales growth across multiple channels by adapting to the evolving shopping habits of our customers. While we are focused on driving sales through product innovation and sales channel optimization, we need to further transform our business model. Part of that transformation has already taken place in our connected watch business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we announced a strategic partnership with Citizen Watch Co., Ltd. ("Citizen") to grow and expand the hybrid smartwatch category, an innovative product in our connected watch portfolio. Under a licensing agreement, we provide Citizen with our proprietary hybrid technology for use in both their brands and third-party watch brands. In January 2019, we announced an agreement to transfer intellectual property related to smartwatch technology to Google. Both of these agreements are expected to drive innovation and reduce costs in our wearables business. We made significant progress on all fronts this year, but we continue to have further work ahead of us to address the structural changes in our categories and channels. We remain confident in our strategies and believe we have the talent, operating platform and balance sheet strength to achieve our goals. Constant Currency Financial Information As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The translation of the operations of our foreign-based entities from their local currencies into U.S. dollars is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and can have a significant impact on our reported financial results. In general, our overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business. As a result, in addition to presenting financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), our discussion contains references to constant currency financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate net sales on a constant currency basis, net sales for the current fiscal year for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average rates during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. We present constant currency information to provide investors with a basis to evaluate how our underlying business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The constant currency financial information presented herein should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures 30 Table of Contents of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between constant currency financial information and the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included where applicable. Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017 Consolidated Net Sales. Net sales decreased $246.7 million or 8.8% ( 9.6% in constant currency) for fiscal year 2018 , as compared to fiscal year 2017 . Global watch sales decreased $166.0 million or 7.5% ( 8.2% in constant currency), with increases in EMPORIO ARMANI and ARMANI EXCHANGE more than offset by declines in most other brands in our portfolio. Our jewelry category decreased $43.9 million or 20.7% ( 22.3% in constant currency), mostly as a result of a decrease in sales of MICHAEL KORS and FOSSIL branded products during fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 . Our leathers business decreased $36.1 million or 11.1% ( 11.9% in constant currency). Net sales information by product category is summarized on a reported and constant currency basis as follows (dollars in millions): Fiscal Year 2018 2017 Growth (Decline) Percentage of Total Percentage of Total Percentage as Reported Percentage Constant Currency Amounts Amounts Dollars Watches $ 2,033.0 80.0 % $ 2,199.0 78.9 % $ (166.0 ) (7.5 )% (8.2 )% Leathers 289.4 11.4 325.5 11.7 (36.1 ) (11.1 ) (11.9 ) Jewelry 167.8 6.6 211.7 7.6 (43.9 ) (20.7 ) (22.3 ) Other 51.3 2.0 52.0 1.8 (0.7 ) (1.3 ) (2.9 ) Total net sales $ 2,541.5 100.0 % $ 2,788.2 100.0 % $ (246.7 ) (8.8 )% (9.6 )% The following table sets forth consolidated net sales by segment on a reported and constant currency basis (dollars in millions): Fiscal Year 2018 2017 Growth (Decline) Percentage of Total Percentage of Total Percentage as Reported Percentage Constant Currency Amounts Amounts Dollars Americas $ 1,174.5 46.2 % $ 1,314.4 47.1 % $ (139.9 ) (10.6 )% (10.5 )% Europe 856.3 33.7 971.8 34.9 (115.5 ) (11.9 ) (14.3 ) Asia 505.5 19.9 496.4 17.8 9.1 1.8 1.7 Corporate 5.2 0.2 5.6 0.2 (0.4 ) (7.1 ) (7.1 ) Total net sales $ 2,541.5 100.0 % $ 2,788.2 100.0 % $ (246.7 ) (8.8 )% (9.6 )% Americas Net Sales. Americas net sales decreased $139.9 million or 10.6% ( 10.5% in constant currency), largely driven by decreases in watches. During fiscal year 2018 , our multi-brand watch portfolio decreased $93.2 million or 9.0% ( 8.9% in constant currency), with declines across nearly all brands. The business exits of BURBERRY and ADIDAS, as well as store closures negatively impacted our watch performance. Within FOSSIL brand watches, connected watches nearly offset the declines in traditional watches. Our leathers category decreased $26.4 million or 13.3% ( 13.2% in constant currency), mainly driven by FOSSIL branded products and our jewelry business decreased $20.3 million or 28.8% ( 28.9% in constant currency), mostly driven by MICHAEL KORS branded product. Within the region, sales declined in the U.S. and Canada, while sales in Mexico increased. Comparable retail sales (including e-commerce) decreased slightly in the region, as negative comparable sales in our stores were mostly offset by strong positive comparable sales in our e-commerce business. 31 Table of Contents The following table sets forth product net sales for the Americas segment on a reported and constant currency basis by fiscal year (dollars in millions): Net Sales Fiscal Year Growth (Decline) Percentage as Reported Percentage Constant Currency 2018 2017 Dollars Watches $ 936.9 $ 1,030.1 $ (93.2 ) (9.0 )% (8.9 )% Leathers 171.8 198.2 (26.4 ) (13.3 ) (13.2 ) Jewelry 50.3 70.6 (20.3 ) (28.8 ) (28.9 ) Other 15.5 15.5 0.6 Total $ 1,174.5 $ 1,314.4 $ (139.9 ) (10.6 )% (10.5 )% Europe Net Sales. During fiscal year 2018 , Europe net sales decreased $115.5 million or 11.9% ( 14.3% in constant currency). Across the Eurozone, sales were down moderately with the sharpest sales declines in the U.K., France and Germany. During fiscal year 2018, sales trends softened across all channels, reflective of the challenging macro-economic environment and general softness in the European markets. Our multi-brand watch portfolio decreased $85.4 million or 11.5% ( 13.8% in constant currency), with growth in connected watches partially offsetting declines in traditional watches on a constant currency basis. Within our watch portfolio, most brands declined with the most significant sales decreases in FOSSIL and SKAGEN brand watches. Our jewelry category decreased $22.6 million or 16.8% ( 19.4% in constant currency), and our leathers business decreased $8.1 million or 10.7% ( 13.8% in constant currency) in fiscal year 2018 , as compared to fiscal year 2017. Comparable retail sales in the Europe segment (including e-commerce) decreased modestly, with decreases in all major product categories. Slight comparable retail sales increases in e-commerce and our outlets were more than offset by declines in our other store concepts. The following table sets forth product net sales for the Europe segment on a reported and constant currency basis by fiscal year (dollars in millions): Net Sales Fiscal Year Growth (Decline) Percentage as Reported Percentage Constant Currency 2018 2017 Dollars Watches $ 656.8 $ 742.2 $ (85.4 ) (11.5 )% (13.8 )% Leathers 67.3 75.4 (8.1 ) (10.7 ) (13.8 ) Jewelry 111.6 134.2 (22.6 ) (16.8 ) (19.4 ) Other 20.6 20.0 0.6 3.0 (0.5 ) Total $ 856.3 $ 971.8 $ (115.5 ) (11.9 )% (14.3 )% Asia Net Sales. In fiscal year 2018 , Asia net sales increased $9.1 million or 1.8% ( 1.7% in constant currency). On a constant currency basis, sales growth in India and China more than offset decreases in most other markets, with the sharpest declines in Japan. Our watch category increased $12.2 million or 2.9% ( 2.9% in constant currency), with the growth led by EMPORIO ARMANI and FOSSIL watches. Our leathers products decreased $1.7 million or 3.3% ( 4.2% in constant currency), and our jewelry business decreased $0.9 million or 13.2% ( 14.7% in constant currency). Comparable retail sales (including e-commerce) in the Asia region decreased moderately, with similar decreases in all major product categories. Comparable store sales declines were partially offset by strong e-commerce sales increases. 32 Table of Contents The following table sets forth product net sales for the Asia segment on a reported and constant currency basis by fiscal year (dollars in millions): Net Sales Fiscal Year Growth (Decline) Percentage as Reported Percentage Constant Currency 2018 2017 Dollars Watches $ 439.0 $ 426.8 $ 12.2 2.9 % 2.9 % Leathers 50.3 52.0 (1.7 ) (3.3 ) (4.2 ) Jewelry 5.9 6.8 (0.9 ) (13.2 ) (14.7 ) Other 10.3 10.8 (0.5 ) (4.6 ) (5.6 ) Total $ 505.5 $ 496.4 $ 9.1 1.8 % 1.7 % Stores. The following table sets forth the number of stores by concept for the fiscal years ended below: December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Americas Europe Asia Total Americas Europe Asia Total Accessory stores 89 94 53 236 108 106 59 273 Outlets 126 74 40 240 136 74 46 256 Full priced multi-brand 5 3 8 8 7 15 Total stores 215 173 96 484 244 188 112 544 During fiscal year 2018 , we opened seven new stores and closed 67 stores. During fiscal year 2019 , we anticipate opening approximately 10 additional retail stores and closing approximately 30 stores globally, depending on lease negotiations. Both stores and e-commerce sites are included in comparable retail sales in the thirteenth month of operation. Stores that experience a gross square footage increase of 10% or more due to an expansion and/or relocation are removed from the comparable store sales base, but are included in total sales. These stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the expansion and/or relocation. Comparable retail sales also exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. Gross Profit. Gross profit of $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2018 decreased 1.4% compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2017 , mainly as a result of decreased sales and mostly offset by a higher gross margin rate. Gross profit margin increased 400 basis points to 52.7% in fiscal year 2018 compared to 48.7% in the prior fiscal year, driven in part by a favorable comparison against an inventory valuation reserve of approximately $40 million, primarily for excess levels of connected products recorded in fiscal year 2017, lower promotional activity and markdowns and favorable product mix. Gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by approximately 80 basis points due to currency movements, as well as benefits from NWF driven by direct sourcing and design to value initiatives. Operating Expenses. For fiscal year 2018 , total operating expenses decreased by $505.7 million and, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 50.3% , compared to 64.0% in fiscal year 2017 , largely due to decreased non-cash intangible impairment charges of $6.2 million in fiscal year 2018 compared to $407.1 million recorded in fiscal 2017. During fiscal year 2018, we incurred restructuring charges of $46.6 million under our NWF initiative compared to restructuring charges of $48.2 million in fiscal year 2017. During fiscal year 2018 , excluding non-cash intangible impairment charges and restructuring, operating expenses decreased, primarily due to corporate and regional infrastructure reductions, lower store costs due to store closures and lower variable marketing expenses. The translation of foreign-denominated expenses during fiscal year 2018 increased operating expenses by approximately $13.7 million as a result of the weaker U.S. dollar. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 48.2% in fiscal 2018, as compared to 47.6% in fiscal 2017 due to the lower sales base. Consolidated Operating Income (Loss). Operating income (loss) increased to income of $62.7 million in fiscal year 2018 , as compared to a loss of $424.3 million in the prior fiscal year, primarily driven by decreased non-cash intangible impairment charges of $6.2 million in fiscal year 2018 compared to $407.1 million in fiscal year 2017. Operating expenses in fiscal year 2017 included non-cash intangible impairment charges on our goodwill of $202.3 million, $114.3 million and $42.9 million in the Americas, Europe and Asia segments, respectively, and impairment charges on our trade names of $47.6 million in corporate, while fiscal year 2018 included trade name impairment charges of $6.2 million in corporate. Decreased sales were largely offset by an increased gross margin rate. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin improved to 2.5% in fiscal year 2018 as compared to (15.2)% in fiscal year 2017 . Excluding non-cash intangible impairment charges and restructuring expenses, operating income improved $84.5 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. 33 Table of Contents Operating income (loss) by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Fiscal Year Growth (Decline) Operating Margin % 2018 2017 Dollars Percentage 2018 2017 Americas $ 185.1 $ (47.9 ) $ 233.0 (486.4 )% 15.8 % (3.6 )% Europe 129.6 32.9 96.7 293.9 15.1 3.4 Asia 87.5 (12.5 ) 100.0 (800.0 ) 17.3 (2.5 ) Corporate (339.5 ) (396.8 ) 57.3 (14.4 ) Total operating income (loss) $ 62.7 $ (424.3 ) $ 487.0 (114.8 )% 2.5 % (15.2 )% Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $0.7 million in fiscal year 2018 , as a result of lower debt levels, partially offset by higher interest rates on our amended credit facility. Other Income (Expense) Net. During fiscal year 2018 , other income (expense) - net was expense of $38,000 compared to income of $13.7 million in fiscal year 2017, primarily driven by net foreign currency losses in fiscal year 2018 compared to net foreign currency gains in fiscal year 2017 resulting from cash flow hedging and other transactional activities. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense for fiscal year 2018 was $21.1 million , resulting in an effective tax rate of 104.7% , compared to (4.4)% in fiscal year 2017 . The 2018 effective rate was negatively impacted by the accrual of valuation allowances on U.S. and some foreign deferred tax assets and the inclusion of foreign income taxed in the U.S. which was partially offset by certain favorable permanent differences. The 2017 effective rate was negatively impacted by the accrual of a valuation allowance on U.S. net deferred tax assets as well as some foreign deferred tax assets, the non-deductibility of intangible asset impairments, and the impact of a one-time repatriation tax on deferred foreign earnings under the Tax Act. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. Fiscal year 2018 net income (loss) attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. was a loss of $0.07 per diluted share in comparison to a loss of $9.87 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year. Fiscal year 2018 included restructuring charges of $0.75 per diluted share and non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $0.10 per diluted share. In comparison, fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings (loss) per share included non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $7.07 per diluted share, tax charges resulting from the Tax Act and valuation allowances established on deferred tax assets of $2.20 per diluted share and restructuring charges of $0.65 per diluted share. Excluding the impacts from restructuring expenses, non-cash intangible asset impairment charges, and the Tax Act and valuation allowance, net income attributable to Fossil, Group, Inc. increased $0.73 per diluted share in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 largely due to the impacts from NWF benefits, a favorable comparison against an inventory valuation reserve of approximately $40 million, primarily for excess levels of connected products recorded in fiscal year 2017, and store closures. Fiscal year 2018 net income (loss) attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. was negatively impacted by lower sales which was partly offset by an increased gross margin rate. Currencies, including both the translation impact on operating earnings and the impact of foreign currency hedging contracts, favorably affected the year-over-year diluted earnings (loss) per share comparison by $0.09 . Fiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016 Consolidated Net Sales. Net sales decreased $254.2 million or 8.4% (9.1% in constant currency) for fiscal year 2017, as compared to fiscal year 2016. Global watch sales decreased $131.3 million or 5.6% (6.4% in constant currency), with increases in EMPORIO ARMANI, ARMANI EXCHANGE and FOSSIL more than offset by declines in most other brands in our portfolio. Our leathers business decreased $68.3 million or 17.3% (18.0% in constant currency). Our jewelry category decreased $39.7 million or 15.8% (16.7% in constant currency), mostly as a result of a decrease in sales of MICHAEL KORS, FOSSIL and MISFIT branded products during fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016. 34 Table of Contents Net sales information by product category is summarized on a reported and constant currency basis as follows (dollars in millions): Fiscal Year 2017 2016 Growth (Decline) Percentage of Total Percentage of Total Percentage as Reported Percentage Constant Currency Amounts Amounts Dollars Watches $ 2,199.0 78.9 % $ 2,330.3 76.6 % $ (131.3 ) (5.6 )% (6.4 )% Leathers 325.5 11.7 393.8 12.9 (68.3 ) (17.3 ) (18.0 ) Jewelry 211.7 7.6 251.4 8.3 (39.7 ) (15.8 ) (16.7 ) Other 52.0 1.8 66.9 2.2 (14.9 ) (22.3 ) (22.6 ) Total net sales $ 2,788.2 100.0 % $ 3,042.4 100.0 % $ (254.2 ) (8.4 )% (9.1 )% The following table sets forth consolidated net sales by segment on a reported and constant currency basis (dollars in millions): Fiscal Year 2017 2016 Growth (Decline) Percentage as Reported Percentage Constant Currency Percentage of Total Percentage of Total Amounts Amounts Dollars Americas $ 1,314.4 47.1 % $ 1,523.5 50.1 % $ (209.1 ) (13.7 )% (13.9 )% Europe 971.8 34.9 996.8 32.8 (25.0 ) (2.5 ) (4.4 ) Asia 496.4 17.8 514.7 16.9 (18.3 ) (3.6 ) (4.1 ) Corporate 5.6 0.2 7.4 0.2 (1.8 ) (24.3 ) (24.3 ) Total net sales $ 2,788.2 100.0 % $ 3,042.4 100.0 % $ (254.2 ) (8.4 )% (9.1 )% Americas Net Sales. During fiscal year 2017, the Americas segment was our most challenging. Americas net sales decreased $209.1 million or 13.7% ( 13.9% in constant currency), largely driven by watches. During fiscal year 2017, our multi-brand watch portfolio decreased $132.2 million or 11.4% (11.5% in constant currency), with declines across all brands. Continued softness in traditional watches was partially offset by increases in connected watches, with the strongest performances coming from FOSSIL and MICHAEL KORS connected watches. Our leathers category decreased $49.5 million or 20.0% (20.2% in constant currency), largely driven by FOSSIL branded product, and our jewelry business decreased $21.1 million or 23.0% (23.3% in constant currency), largely due to MISFIT branded product. Within the region, sales declined in the U.S. and Canada, while sales in Mexico were flat. Comparable retail sales (including e-commerce) decreased moderately in the region, as negative comparable sales in our stores were partially offset by positive comparable sales in our e-commerce business. The following table sets forth product net sales for the Americas segment on a reported and constant currency basis by fiscal year (dollars in millions): Net Sales Fiscal Year Growth (Decline) Percentage as Reported Percentage Constant Currency 2017 2016 Dollars Watches $ 1,030.1 $ 1,162.3 $ (132.2 ) (11.4 )% (11.5 )% Leathers 198.2 247.7 (49.5 ) (20.0 ) (20.2 ) Jewelry 70.6 91.7 (21.1 ) (23.0 ) (23.3 ) Other 15.5 21.8 (6.3 ) (28.9 ) (28.4 ) Total $ 1,314.4 $ 1,523.5 $ (209.1 ) (13.7 )% (13.9 )% Europe Net Sales. During fiscal year 2017, Europe net sales decreased $25.0 million or 2.5% ( 4.4% in constant currency). Across the Eurozone, sales were down modestly while distributor markets in Eastern Europe and the Middle East declined significantly. Our multi-brand watch portfolio increased $2.3 million or 0.3% (decreased 1.7% in constant currency), 35 Table of Contents with growth in connected watches largely offsetting declines in traditional watches on a constant currency basis. Within our watch portfolio, ARMANI EXCHANGE, ARMANI and FOSSIL increased, while all other brands declined. Our jewelry category decreased $12.9 million or 8.8% (10.3% in constant currency), and our leathers business decreased $9.0 million or 10.7% (12.4% in constant currency) in fiscal year 2017, as compared to fiscal year 2016. Comparable retail sales in the Europe segment (including e-commerce) decreased modestly, with increases in the watch category more than offset by decreases in our other product categories. Strong e-commerce increases were more than offset by declines in our owned retail stores driven by both store closures and negative comparable retail sales.

In fiscal year 2017, Asia net sales decreased $18.3 million or 3.6% ( 4.1% in constant currency). On a constant currency basis, sales growth in India and China was more than offset by decreases in most other markets, with the sharpest declines in Japan and South Korea. Our watch category decreased $1.3 million or 0.3% (0.8% in constant currency), with increases in EMPORIO ARMANI, driven by both traditional and connected watches, and FOSSIL watches more than offset by decreases in most other brands. Our leathers products decreased $9.7 million or 15.7% (16.5% in constant currency), and our jewelry business decreased $5.8 million or 46.0% (45.2% in constant currency). Comparable retail sales (including e-commerce) in the Asia region decreased moderately, with declines in leathers and jewelry partially offset by increases in watches.

Gross profit of $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2017 decreased 13.9% compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2016, mainly as a result of decreased sales and a lower gross margin rate. Gross profit margin decreased 320 basis points to 48.7% in fiscal year 2017 compared to 51.9% in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in gross margin rate as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily driven by the impact of connected products due to both the increase in sales mix of connected products which carry relatively lower margins than traditional products, as well as additional product valuation charges. Our strategy in fiscal 2017 was to invest in margin to drive significant volume in wearables and leverage that volume to drive future cost efficiencies. During fiscal 2017, we nearly doubled our connected sales volumes and finished ahead of the initial cost goals that we set for ourselves in fiscal year 2017. However, we did not achieve the aggressive sales goals that we set for ourselves in this new category, resulting in carrying greater levels of connected product inventory. Consequently, having higher levels of connected inventory than planned and even deferring some receipts to fiscal year 2018 resulted in additional valuation charges of approximately $40 million to support our efforts to clear this inventory. The shift in sales mix towards connected product and the related valuation charges reduced our gross margin rate by 280 basis points. The gross margin rate was also negatively impacted by increased promotional activity in our outlets and e-commerce channels. Product cost benefits generated from our NWF supply chain initiatives partially offset these headwinds, and the currency impact for the year remained neutral. Operating Expenses. For fiscal year 2017, total operating expenses increased by $332.1 million and, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 64.0%, compared to 47.7% in fiscal year 2016, primarily due to intangible impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, interim impairment tests were performed on goodwill and trade names due to the sustained declines in our market capitalization and sales trends, resulting in impairment expenses of $359.5 million for goodwill and $47.6 million for trade names. For additional information, refer to Note 1-Significant Accounting Policies in the consolidated financial statements. During fiscal year 2017, we incurred restructuring charges of $48.2 million under our NWF initiative compared to restructuring charges of $27.8 million in fiscal year 2016. During fiscal year 2017, SG&A expenses decreased, primarily due to corporate overhead reductions and cost reductions in our regional organizations across the globe, as well as a lower store base and reduced marketing expenses. The translation of foreign-denominated expenses during fiscal year 2017 increased operating expenses by approximately $8.1 million as a result of the weaker U.S. dollar. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 47.6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to 46.8% in fiscal 2016. Consolidated Operating Income (Loss). Operating income (loss) decreased to a loss of $424.3 million in fiscal year 2017, as compared to income of $127.1 million in the prior fiscal year, primarily driven by non-cash intangible impairment charges of $407.1 million and also by decreased sales and gross margin rate. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin decreased to (15.2)% in fiscal year 2017 as compared to 4.2% in fiscal year 2016. For fiscal year 2017, the positive currency impact on gross margin was offset by the negative currency impact on expenses, resulting in a neutral impact to operating income (loss). In fiscal year 2017, we continued to face retail pressure, most significantly in our traditional watch business in all segments. Additionally, the gross margin rate was negatively impacted by connected products, due to both lower connected margins as well as additional product valuation charges, and lower retail margins due to increased promotional activity in outlets and the e-commerce channel in all segments. Operating expenses increased significantly, primarily due to non-cash impairment charges on our goodwill of $202.3 million, $114.3 million and $42.9 million in the Americas, Europe and Asia segments, respectively, and impairment charges on our trade names of $47.6 million in corporate. Increased restructuring charges were more than offset by savings in our infrastructure, store costs and marketing expenses. Operating income (loss) by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Fiscal Year Growth (Decline) Operating Margin % 2017 2016 Dollars Percentage 2017 2016 Americas $ (47.9 ) $ 239.7 $ (287.6 ) (120.0 )% (3.6 )% 15.7 % Europe 32.9 172.5 (139.6 ) (80.9 ) 3.4 17.3 Asia (12.5 ) 76.7 (89.2 ) (116.3 ) (2.5 ) 14.9 Corporate (396.8 ) (361.8 ) (35.0 ) 9.7 Total operating income (loss) $ (424.3 ) $ 127.1 $ (551.4 ) (433.8 )% (15.2 )% 4.2 % Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $16.3 million in fiscal year 2017, primarily as a result of increased interest rates in comparison to the prior fiscal year. Other Income (Expense) Net. During fiscal year 2017, other income (expense) - net decreased by approximately $0.3 million, driven by fewer gains on the liquidation of non-operating assets, losses on the extinguishment of our term loan in fiscal year 2017 and decreased net foreign currency gains resulting from cash flow hedging and other transactional activities as 37 Table of Contents compared to fiscal year 2016. These headwinds were mostly offset by increased interest income and decreased losses on our equity method investment. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense for fiscal year 2017 was $19.8 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of (4.4)%, compared to 25.1% in fiscal year 2016. The 2017 effective rate was negatively impacted by the accrual of a valuation allowance on U.S. net deferred tax assets as well as some foreign deferred tax assets, the non-deductibility of intangible asset impairments, and the imposition of a one-time repatriation tax on deferred foreign earnings under the Tax Act. The impacts from the tax reform and the U.S. valuation allowances resulted in combined charges of $106.7 million or $2.20 per diluted share. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. Fiscal year 2017 net income (loss) attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. was a loss of $9.87 per diluted share in comparison to net income of $1.63 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share included non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $7.07 per diluted share, tax charges resulting from the Tax Act and valuation allowances established on deferred tax assets of $2.20 per diluted share and restructuring charges of $0.65 per diluted share. Fiscal year 2016 diluted earnings (loss) per share included restructuring charges of $0.37 per diluted share. Fiscal year 2017 net income (loss) attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. was also negatively impacted by lower sales and gross margin rate. Currencies, including both the translation impact on operating earnings and the impact of foreign currency hedging contracts, unfavorably affected the year-over-year diluted earnings (loss) per share comparison by $0.01. 38 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of fiscal year 2018 was $403.4 million , including $274.6 million held by foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S., in comparison to $231.2 million at the end of fiscal year 2017 . Historically, our business operations have not required substantial cash during the first several months of our fiscal year. Generally, starting in the third quarter, our cash needs begin to increase, typically reaching a peak in the September-November time frame as we increase inventory levels in advance of the holiday season. Our quarterly cash requirements are also impacted by strategic investments such as acquisitions, other capital expenditures, restructuring charges and debt repayments. We believe that cash flows from operations combined with existing cash on hand and amounts available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the next twelve months. For fiscal year 2018 , we generated operating cash flow of $248.1 million . This operating cash flow combined with cash on hand was utilized to fund $46.5 million in net repayments on our credit facilities and $18.0 million in capital expenditures. Net losses of $0.9 million were offset by net non-cash items of $108.8 million and a net decrease in working capital items of $140.3 million driven mainly by inventory reduction initiatives. Non-cash items primarily consisted of depreciation, amortization and accretion charges of $67.6 million and stock-based compensation of $23.0 million . Accounts receivable decreased by 10.6% to $328.0 million at the end of fiscal year 2018 compared to $367.0 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. Average days sales outstanding for our wholesale business for fiscal year 2018 decreased one day as compared to fiscal year 2017 . Inventory at the end of fiscal year 2018 was $377.6 million , representing a decrease of 34.2% from the prior fiscal year inventory balance of $573.8 million driven by our focus on reducing inventory to clear our previous generation connected products and other slow moving inventory. At the end of fiscal year 2018 , we had working capital of $652.8 million compared to working capital of $781.9 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. Additionally, at the end of fiscal year 2018 , we had approximately $126.4 million of outstanding short-term borrowings and $269.8 million in long-term debt. For the fiscal year ending December 28, 2019, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $30 million. Of this amount, we expect approximately 40% will be for strategic growth, including investments in omni-channel, global concessions and technology, approximately 35% will be for technology and facilities maintenance and approximately 25% will be for retail store expansion and renovation. Our capital expenditure budget and allocation of it to the foregoing investments are estimates and are subject to change. We believe that cash flows from operations combined with existing cash on hand and amounts available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months. Debt Facilities On January 29, 2018, we and certain of our foreign subsidiaries entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement provides for (i) revolving credit loans in the amount of $325 million, subject to a borrowing base (as described below) (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), with an up to $45.0 million subfacility for letters of credit, and (ii) a term loan in the amount of $425 million (the "Term Loan Facility"). The Credit Agreement expires and is due and payable on December 31, 2020. Availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and any letters of credit are subject to a borrowing base equal to, (a) with respect to Fossil Group, Inc., the sum of (i) 85% of eligible U.S. accounts receivable and 90% of net U.S. credit card receivables (less any dilution reserve), and (ii) the lesser of (A) 65% of the lower of cost or market value of eligible U.S. finished good inventory and (B) 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible U.S. finished goods inventory, minus (iii) the aggregate amount of reserves, if any, established by the Administrative Agent in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable business judgment from the perspective of a secured asset-based lender; and (b) with respect to each non-U.S. borrower, the sum of (i) 85% of eligible accounts receivable of the non-U.S. borrowers (less any dilution reserve) and (ii) the least of (A) 65% of the lower of cost or market value of eligible foreign finished goods inventory of the non-U.S. borrowers, (B) 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible foreign finished goods inventory of the non-U.S. borrowers, and (C) $185,000,000 minus (iii) the aggregate amount of reserves, if any, established by the Administrative Agent in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable business judgment from the perspective of a secured asset-based lender. In connection with the Credit Agreement, we and all of our domestic subsidiaries entered into a Collateral Agreement in favor of the Administrative Agent, pursuant to which we and our subsidiaries granted liens on all or substantially all of our assets in order to secure our obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents (the Obligations ). Additionally, all of our domestic subsidiaries entered into a Guaranty Agreement in favor of the Administrative Agent, pursuant 39 Table of Contents to which such subsidiaries guarantee the payment and performance of the Obligations. Additionally, Fossil Group Europe and the other non-U.S. borrowers from time to time party to the Credit Agreement are required to enter into security instruments with respect to all or substantially all of their assets that can be pledged under applicable local law.

Selected Quarterly Consolidated Financial Data The table below sets forth selected quarterly consolidated financial information. The information is derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements and includes all normal and recurring adjustments that management considers necessary for a fair statement of results for such periods.

Certain line items presented in the tables below, when aggregated, may not agree with the corresponding line items on our consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 due to rounding (in thousands, except percentage and per share data). Fiscal Year 2018 1st Qtr 2nd Qtr 3rd Qtr 4th Qtr Net sales $ 569,156 $ 576,583 $ 608,827 $ 786,922 Gross profit 287,691 309,009 326,532 416,904 Net income (loss) (47,505 ) (7,237 ) 5,922 47,882 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 768 563 916 293 Net income (loss) attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. $ (48,273 ) $ (7,800 ) $ 5,006 $ 47,589 Earnings (loss) per share: Basic $ (0.99 ) $ (0.16 ) $ 0.10 $ 0.96 Diluted $ (0.99 ) $ (0.16 ) $ 0.10 $ 0.94 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 50.5 % 53.6 % 53.6 % 53.0 % Fiscal Year 2017 1st Qtr 2nd Qtr 3rd Qtr 4th Qtr Net sales $ 581,790 $ 596,846 $ 688,722 $ 920,805 Gross profit 289,519 301,347 319,893 448,080 Net income (loss) (46,789 ) (343,099 ) (5,479 ) (78,192 ) Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest 1,397 1,613 (80 ) 1,683 Net income (loss) attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. $ (48,186 ) $ (344,712 ) $ (5,399 ) $ (79,875 ) Earnings (loss) per share: Basic $ (1.00 ) $ (7.11 ) $ (0.11 ) $ (1.65 ) Diluted $ (1.00 ) $ (7.11 ) $ (0.11 ) $ (1.65 ) Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 49.8 % 50.5 % 46.4 % 48.7 % While the majority of our products are not seasonal in nature, a significant portion of our net sales and operating income is generally derived in the second half of the fiscal year. Our third and fourth quarters, which include the "back to school" and holiday seasons, have historically generated a significant portion of our annual operating income. Connected products appear to be more seasonal than traditional products which may further impact our operational performance in the third and fourth quarters as compared to the first half of the year. The amount of net sales and operating income generated during the first quarter is affected by the levels of inventory held by retailers at the end of the holiday season, as well as general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. In general, lower levels of inventory held by retailers at the end of the holiday season may have a positive impact on our net sales and operating income in the first quarter of the following fiscal year as a result of higher levels of restocking orders placed by retailers. As we expand our e-commerce business and improve productivity in our retail store base, sales from the direct to consumer distribution channel may increase as a percentage of the total sales mix. Based upon the historical seasonality of direct to consumer sales, we believe this expansion could result in higher levels of profitability in the fourth quarter and lower levels of profitability in the first and second quarters when, due to seasonality, it is more difficult to leverage retail store four wall operating costs and back office expenses against a lower level of sales productivity. In addition, new product launches 42 Table of Contents would generally augment the sales and operating expense levels in the quarter the product launch takes place. The results of operations for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors, including retail, economic and monetary conditions, timing of orders or holidays, the timing of investments and the mix of products sold by us.
