OVERVIEW We are a global beauty company and our vision is to be a new global leader and challenger in the beauty industry. We manufacture, market, sell and distribute branded beauty products, including fragrances, color cosmetics, hair care products and skin & body related products throughout the world. Operating and Reportable Segments Our business is organized into three divisions: Luxury, Consumer Beauty and Professional Beauty, and our operating and reportable segments reflect this divisional structure. Certain shared costs and the results of corporate initiatives are managed outside of our three segments by Corporate. Our organizational structure is product category focused, putting the consumer first, by specifically targeting how and where they shop and what and why they purchase. Each division has full end-to-end responsibility to optimize the consumers beauty experiences in their relevant categories and channels in this new organizational design and translate this into profitable growth. The operating and reportable segments are: Luxury primarily focused on prestige fragrances, premium skin care and premium cosmetics; Consumer Beauty primarily focused on color cosmetics, retail hair coloring and styling products, mass fragrance, mass skin care and body care; Professional Beauty primarily focused on hair and nail care products for professionals. Geographic Structure We have determined our geographic regions to be North America (Canada and the U.S.), Europe and ALMEA (Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and Australia). 28 Overview We are one of the world largest beauty companies, with a purpose to celebrate and liberate the diversity of consumers beauty. Over the past three years, the transformational acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business and our other strategic transactions have strengthened and diversified our presence across the countries, categories and channels in which we compete. As we complete the final stages of the P&G Beauty Business integration, we are focused on rejuvenating our core business and amplifying our growth potential, by supporting and strengthening our brands, developing a stronger innovation pipeline, advancing our end-to-end digital transformation, and expanding our presence in the faster-growing emerging markets. The beauty industry has continued to evolve, driven by increasing consumer desire for immersive shopping experiences, the importance of digital communication for brand building, the expanding role of e-commerce and specialty retail formats, and new brand introductions. This evolution has put pressure on traditional retail formats and traditional models of brand building and reaching consumers. We are tailoring our approach to address this evolution of the beauty industry. Revenues from e-commerce channels comprise a small but fast-growing portion of our consolidated net revenues. Transforming our digital and e-commerce capabilities is a central part of our overall strategy. While we are still in the early days of our digital transformation, we are making significant multi-year investments in talent acquisition, in-house content creation capabilities and product management systems that will fuel our e-commerce efforts. This, together with the dedication across each of our divisions to drive momentum in this rapidly expanding channel, will allow for expansion of our e-commerce footprint. The economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact the timing of our sales and operating performance each period. In addition, as product life cycles shorten, results are driven primarily by successfully developing, introducing and marketing new, innovative products. We are continuing to improve our innovation process, aiming to introduce bigger, more impactful innovations while reducing time-to-market. We also support new and established products through our focus on strategic advertising and merchandising, brand repositioning, innovation and in-store execution. Certain market segments and geographies in which we compete generally continue to grow moderately. While luxury fragrances and skin care categories are experiencing strong growth, low single digit declines in the retail nail, retail hair, mass body care, mass color cosmetics and mass fragrances categories in the U.S. and certain key countries in Western Europe continue to impact our business and financial results. We experienced strong growth in our Luxury segment supported by strong category trends and our successful brand innovation, steady growth in our Professional Beauty segment and uneven performance in our Consumer Beauty segment. Emerging markets have been a source of growth in many of our categories in fiscal 2018. We are also continuing to expand our presence in faster-growth emerging markets, by building strong relationships with key retailers in those markets and leveraging our broad portfolio of brands. Transformation of our business Following our acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business, we have been focused on integrating, restructuring and optimizing the combined organization. In fiscal 2018, we successfully exited the third and final stage of our transition services agreement with P&G, following the successful exit of the first two stages in fiscal 2017. We also instituted new initiatives to deliver meaningful, sustainable expense and cost management to address increases in our fixed cost base as a combined company. The last step of the integration includes the completion of the one order, one invoice, one shipment program which will make Coty a fully integrated company, able to sell, ship and invoice all of our brands in a seamless way for our customers, allowing significant simplification for our employees and increasing our scalability potential. Further, in connection with the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business, we are implementing our plan through which we continue to target realizing approximately $750 million of synergies driven by cost, procurement, supply chain and selling, general, and administrative savings through fiscal 2020. We realized cumulative synergies of approximately 20% in fiscal 2017, 50% though fiscal 2018, and we expect to cumulatively generate approximately 80% of the net synergies throughout fiscal 2019 and the full $750 million through fiscal 2020. A milestone in our transformation was the completion in fiscal 2018 of our announced portfolio rationalization program and, as a result, we divested or terminated 14 brands including: CLC , Celine Dion , Cutex , Esprit , Guess , Halle Berry , JLo , Lady Gaga , Love2Love , Playboy , Summer and Tim McGraw, which were reported in our Consumer Beauty segment and Cerruti and Chopard, which were reported in our Luxury segment. In addition, we continuously evaluate strategic transactions including acquisitions, divestitures and new brand licenses to optimize our portfolio. During fiscal 2018, we acquired the exclusive long-term global license rights and other related assets for the Burberry Beauty luxury fragrances, cosmetics and skincare business (the Burberry Beauty Business ), which is managed within the Luxury division. We will continue to opportunistically look at strategic opportunities as and when they arise, subject to our strict financial discipline and deleveraging objectives. Performance 29 In fiscal 2018, solid operating performance was driven by steady progress on business integration. Modest revenue growth was driven by strong performance in Luxury, due to impactful innovations across the major brands, and solid growth in Professional Beauty supported by growth in both hair and nail categories, offset by declines in Consumer Beauty revenues as we made gradual progress towards stabilizing performance. In the fourth fiscal quarter, strong performance from Luxury and solid growth in Professional Beauty were offset by declines in Consumer Beauty, where a number of temporary supply chain disruptions impacted revenues. Specifically, disruptions in two major distribution centers in the U.S. and U.K., due in part to challenges arising in connection with our restructuring efforts, impacted our ability to meet consumer demand for products in the Consumer Beauty segment and resulted in a loss of revenue and increased costs that we expect to continue into the first half of fiscal 2019. In addition, during the same period, a transportation workers strike in Brazil impacted the delivery of raw materials as well as our ability to ship our products to customers in that country. Outlook While we work on the full turnaround of the new Coty, we expect the integration to be largely completed by the end of fiscal 2019. We are focused on returning the business to flat to modest net revenue growth. This level of net revenue growth, combined with our ongoing focus on reducing costs even after the synergies are fully delivered, underpins our medium term target of achieving operating margin growth. Against this backdrop, we view fiscal 2019 as an important step in the right direction to achieve our medium term ambitions. For fiscal 2019, we are targeting operating margin expansion, which, combined with our target of flat to modest net revenue growth would deliver operating income growth. We believe financial performance across quarters in fiscal 2019 will not be linear and the peak of the impact of the supply chain disruptions, due to logistics and manufacturing consolidation, will come in first half of fiscal 2019. We anticipate that this will have a considerable impact on both net revenue and net income. We do expect that the business disruption related impacts will be substantially complete by the end of first half fiscal 2019 and our fiscal 2019 targets take these disruptions into consideration. We are also focused on increasing our cash flow and reducing our indebtedness. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP financial measures including Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. and Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. per common share (collectively, the Adjusted Performance Measures ). The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in tables below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in the beauty industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. Despite the limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures, our management uses the Adjusted Performance Measures as key metrics in the evaluation of our performance and annual budgets and to benchmark performance of our business against our competitors. The following are examples of how these Adjusted Performance Measures are utilized by our management: strategic plans and annual budgets are prepared using the Adjusted Performance Measures; senior management receives a monthly analysis comparing budget to actual operating results that is prepared using the Adjusted Performance Measures; and senior management annual compensation is calculated, in part, by using the Adjusted Performance Measures. In addition, our financial covenant compliance calculations under our debt agreements are substantially derived from these Adjusted Performance Measures. Our management believes that Adjusted Performance Measures are useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of the Company. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures address questions we routinely receive from analysts and investors and, in order to ensure that all investors have access to the same data, our management has determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. The Adjusted Performance Measures exclude the impact of certain items (as further described below) and provide supplemental information regarding our operating performance. By disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures, our management intends to provide investors with a supplemental comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented. Our management believes these measures are also useful to investors as such measures allow investors to evaluate our performance using the same metrics that our management uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance. We provide disclosure of the effects of these non-GAAP financial measures by presenting the corresponding measure prepared in conformity with GAAP in our 30 financial statements, and by providing a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure so that investors may understand the adjustments made in arriving at the non-GAAP financial measures and use the information to perform their own analyses. Adjusted operating income excludes restructuring costs and business structure realignment programs, amortization, acquisition-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts, the impact of accounting modifications from liability plan accounting to equity plan accounting as a result of amended share-based compensation plans, asset impairment charges and other adjustments as described below. We do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period-to-period in terms of size, nature and significance. They are primarily incurred to realign our operating structure and integrate new acquisitions, and fluctuate based on specific facts and circumstances. Additionally, Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. and Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. per common share are adjusted for certain interest and other (income) expense as described below and the related tax effects of each of the items used to derive Adjusted net income as such charges are not used by our management in assessing our operating performance period-to-period. The Adjusted Performance Measures were changed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to incorporate the exclusion of expense and tax effects associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Our management believes that such amortization is not reflective of the results of operations in a particular year because the intangible assets result from the allocation of the acquisition purchase price to the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired. The effect of this exclusion on our non-GAAP presentation was to amend Adjusted operating income in a manner that provides investors with a measure of our operating performance that facilitates period to period comparisons, as well as comparability to our peers. Exclusion of the amortization expense allows investors to compare operating results that are consistent over time for the consolidated company, including newly acquired and long-held businesses, to both acquisitive and nonacquisitive peer companies. Adjusted Performance Measures reflect adjustments based on the following items: Costs related to acquisition activities: We have excluded acquisition-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts such as those related to transaction costs and costs associated with the revaluation of acquired inventory in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction. The nature and amount of such costs vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Also, the size, complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions, which often drives the magnitude of such expenses, may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of any future acquisitions. Restructuring and other business realignment costs: We have excluded costs associated with restructuring and business structure realignment programs to allow for comparable financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance. In addition, the nature and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures, our management is able to further evaluate our ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. Amortization expense: We have excluded the impact of amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. Although we exclude amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP expenses, our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets. Asset impairment charges: We have excluded the impact of asset impairments as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. Share-based compensation adjustment: During fiscal 2016, we excluded the impact of the fiscal 2013 accounting modification from liability plan to equity plan accounting for the share-based compensation plans as well as other share-based compensation transactions that are not reflective of the ongoing and planned pattern of recognition for such expense. Refer to Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 for a full discussion of the share-based compensation adjustment. 31 Interest and other (income) expense: We have excluded foreign currency impacts associated with acquisition-related and debt financing-related forward contracts, as well as debt financing transaction costs as the nature and amount of such charges are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of such transactions. Loss on early extinguishment of debt: We have excluded loss on extinguishment of debt as this represents a non-cash charge, and the amount and frequency of such charges is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt financing transactions. Noncontrolling interest: This adjustment represents the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments included in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests based on the relevant non-controlling interest percentage. Tax: This adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pretax items excluded from Adjusted net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments are based on the tax rates related to the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are received or incurred. While acquiring brands and licenses comprises a part of our overall growth strategy, along with targeting organic growth opportunities, we have excluded acquisition-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and the amount and frequency are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Our management assesses the success of an acquisition as a component of performance using a variety of indicators depending on the size and nature of the acquisition, including: the scale of the combined company by evaluating consolidated and segment financial metrics; the expansion of product offerings by evaluating segment, brand, and geographic performance and the respective strength of the brands; the evaluation of market share expansion in categories and geographies; the earnings per share accretion and substantial incremental free cash flow generation providing financial flexibility for us; and the comparison of actual and projected results, including achievement of projected synergies, post integration; provided that timing for any such comparison will depend on the size and complexity of the acquisition. Constant Currency We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net revenues generated outside of the U.S. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations. Therefore, to supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, certain financial information is presented in constant currency , excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We calculate constant currency information by translating current and prior-period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars into U.S. dollars using prior year foreign currency exchange rates. The constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency that is different to the functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate. The constant currency information we present may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 32 Basis of Presentation of Acquisitions and Divestitures During the period when we complete an acquisition, divestiture or early license termination, the financial results of the current year period are not comparable to the financial results presented in the prior year period. When explaining such changes from period to period and to maintain a consistent basis between periods, we exclude the financial contribution of: (i) the acquired brands or businesses in the current year period until we have twelve months of comparable financial results and (ii) the divested brands or businesses or early terminated brands in the prior year period, to maintain comparable financial results with the current fiscal year period. Acquisitions, divestitures and early license terminations that would impact the comparability of financial results between periods presented in the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are shown in the table below. 2018 2017 First fiscal quarter n/a n/a Second fiscal quarter Acquisition : Burberry Beauty Business (Luxury segment) Acquisitions : P&G Beauty Business (all segments) and ghd (Professional Beauty segment) Third fiscal quarter Termination : Guess (Consumer Beauty segment) Acquisition : Younique (Consumer Beauty segment) Divestiture : J.Lo (Consumer Beauty segment) Fourth fiscal quarter Divestitures : Playboy (Consumer Beauty segment) and Cerruti (Luxury segment) n/a When used herein, the term Acquisitions and Divestitures refer to the financial contributions of the related acquisitions or divestitures and early license terminations shown above, during the period that is not comparable as a result of such acquisitions or divestitures and early license terminations. NET REVENUES In fiscal 2018 , net revenues increased 23% , or $1,747.7 , to $9,398.0 from $7,650.3 in fiscal 2017 . Incremental net revenues from the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business comprised 13% of the total percentage increase in net revenues for the fiscal year and the incremental net revenues from the acquisitions of Younique, ghd, and the Burberry Beauty Business combined comprised 6% of the total percentage increase in net revenues for the fiscal year. The incremental net revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business in the prior year was the primary driver of the significant increase in total net revenues in all of our segments and geographic regions. Excluding the impacts of the Acquisitions and Divestitures, total net revenues in fiscal 2018 increased 4% , or $340.6 , to $7,924.6 from $7,584.0 in fiscal 2017, reflecting a positive price and mix impact of 6% , a positive foreign currency exchange translations impact of 4% , and a decrease in unit volume of 6%. See below for further details of net revenues by segment. In fiscal 2017 , net revenues increased 76% , or $3,301.2 , to $7,650.3 from $4,349.1 in fiscal 2016 . The acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business comprised 41% of total net revenues for the fiscal year and the Hypermarcas Brands, ghd and Younique combined comprised 7% of the total net revenues for the fiscal year. The acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business was the primary driver of the significant increase in total net revenues in all of our segments and geographic regions. The increase in net revenues in fiscal 2017 reflects an increase in unit volume of 75% and a positive price and mix impact of 4%, partially offset by a negative foreign currency exchange translations impact of 3%. Excluding the impacts of the Acquisitions and Divestitures, total net revenues in fiscal 2017 decreased 8% reflecting a negative price and mix impact of 4%, a decrease in unit volume of 3% and a negative foreign currency exchange translations impact of 1%. 33 Net Revenues by Segment Year Ended June 30, Change % (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 2018/2017 2017/2016 NET REVENUES Luxury $ 3,210.5 $ 2,566.6 $ 1,836.6 25 % 40 % Consumer Beauty 4,268.1 3,688.2 2,262.5 16 % 63 % Professional Beauty 1,919.4 1,395.5 250.0 38 % >100% Total $ 9,398.0 $ 7,650.3 $ 4,349.1 23 % 76 % Luxury In fiscal 2018 , net revenues from the Luxury segment increased 25% , or $643.9 to $3,210.5 from $2,566.6 in fiscal 2017 , primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions. The incremental net revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business in the prior year comprised 12% of the total percentage change in net revenues for the segment, and the acquisition of the Burberry Beauty Business comprised 3% of the total percentage change in net revenues for the segment in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. Excluding the impacts of the Acquisitions and Divestitures, net revenues from the Luxury segment increased 10% , or $267.6 , to $2,828.6 in fiscal 2018 from $2,561.0 in fiscal 2017 , reflecting a positive price and mix impact of 5% , a positive foreign currency exchange translations impact of 4% , and an increase in unit volume of 1% . This increase in net revenues primarily reflects: (i) the successful launches of Tiffany & Co . and Gucci Bloom and (ii) higher net revenues from Calvin Klein due to the launch of Obsessed by Calvin Klein and from CK One due to the launch of a successful campaign in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2018 revenues were positively impacted by innovative products across our philosophy , Marc Jacobs and Chloe brands. There was also solid growth in fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017, of Luxury brands sold in China and the Middle East as well as an increased contribution of Luxury brands sold through e-commerce channels. In fiscal 2017 , net revenues from the Luxury segment increased 40% or $730.0 to $2,566.6 from $1,836.6 in fiscal 2016 , primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions. The acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business comprised 33% of the total net revenues for the segment. Hugo Boss and Gucci fragrances were the largest contributors to net revenues as a result of the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business. Excluding the impacts of the Acquisitions and Divestitures, net revenues from the Luxury segment decreased 6%, or $110.0, to $1,726.6 in fiscal 2017 from $1,836.6 in fiscal 2016, reflecting a negative price and mix impact of 3%, a decrease in unit volume of 2%, and a negative foreign currency exchange translations impact of 1%. This decrease primarily reflects lower net revenues from Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs fragrances. Net revenues from Calvin Klein declined due to: (i) our strategic efforts to rationalize wholesale distribution by reducing the amount of product diversion to the value and mass channels resulting in a lower volume and (ii) a higher level of discounting and promotional activities resulting in a negative price and mix. The decline in Marc Jacobs primarily reflects declines in volumes from existing product lines and a lower level of launch activity in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. Consumer Beauty In fiscal 2018 , net revenues from the Consumer Beauty segment increased 16% , or $579.9 , to $4,268.1 from $3,688.2 in fiscal 2017 , due to the impact of the Acquisitions. The incremental net revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business in the prior year comprised 11% of the total percentage change in net revenues for the segment, and the acquisition of Younique comprised 6% of the total percentage change in net revenues for the segment in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Excluding the impacts of the Acquisitions and the Divestitures, net revenues from the Consumer Beauty segment decreased 1% , or $21.2 , to $3,622.3 in fiscal 2018 from $3,643.5 in fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting a decrease in unit volume of 7% , a positive foreign currency exchange translations impact of 3% , and a positive price and mix impact of 3%. The change in net revenues primarily reflects: (i) A decline in net revenues from CoverGirl due to declines in existing product lines along with increased markdowns and trade spending. Despite declines in the brand in fiscal 2018, we have launched a multi-year brand turnaround strategy for CoverGirl in North America in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. (ii) Lower net revenues from Sally Hansen and Playboy due to less innovation in the first half of fiscal 2018 and declines in existing product lines. (iii) Lower net revenues from Risque due to a reduction in volume in Brazil in response to decreased sales discounts in the second half of fiscal 2018 and trade inventory correction. However, we continue to experience market share growth. (iv) Lower net revenues from Astor due to shelf-space losses in Germany. 34 These decreases were partially offset by: (i) Higher net revenues from Nautica primarily driven by increased volume through value distribution channels. (ii) Higher net revenues from Max Factor primarily reflecting increased distribution in China. (iii) Higher net revenues from Guess due to the timing of shipments. In addition, net revenues from Clairol comprised over 5% of the Consumer Beauty net revenues for fiscal 2018. Clairol, whose core markets are the U.S. and the U.K., was pressured in fiscal 2018 but benefited from the relaunch of the Nice'N'Easy franchise, on the back of a breakthrough new formula, with the relaunch now largely implemented on the shelf. In fiscal 2017 , net revenues from the Consumer Beauty segment increased 63% , or $1,425.7 , to $3,688.2 from $2,262.5 in fiscal 2016 , primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions. The acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business, Younique and the incremental net revenues from the seven months of the Hypermarcas Brands in fiscal 2017, comprised 35%, 5% and 5%, respectively, of the total net revenues for the segment. CoverGirl and Max Factor cosmetics and the retail product line of Wella and Clairol hair products were the largest contributors to net revenues as a result of the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business, although these and other brands were negatively impacted as we reorganized our business and by transitional factors, including significantly higher than expected trade inventory prior to the closing of the P&G Beauty Business acquisition. Additionally, a reduction in shelf space and declines in certain of these brands negatively impacted our results. Excluding the impacts of the Acquisitions and the Divestitures, net revenues from the Consumer Beauty segment decreased 10%, or $217.7, to $2,038.5 in fiscal 2017 from $2,256.2 in fiscal 2016, primarily reflecting a negative price and mix impact of 5%, a decrease in unit volume of 3%, and a negative foreign currency exchange translations impact of 2%. The decrease in net revenues primarily reflects lower net revenues from mass fragrances, as well as Sally Hansen and Rimmel . Mass fragrances declined in part due to a decrease in volume from brands that are later in their lifecycles and our continued efforts to execute portfolio rationalization in non-strategic distribution channels, and have also been adversely impacted by a negative market trend in the U.S. Lower net revenues from Sally Hansen and Rimmel reflect a decrease in volume as the result of the implementation of a new inventory management system by a key U.S. customer and a negative foreign currency translations impact. Lower net revenues from Sally Hansen also reflect the negative retail nail market trend in the U.S. and a lower volume of relative higher priced products. The declines in the segment were partially offset by higher net revenues from an increase in volume from the Hypermarcas Brands during the five months of the comparable periods and an increase in volume from Bourjois due to continued expansion in Eastern Europe. Professional Beauty In fiscal 2018 , net revenues from the Professional Beauty segment increased 38% , or $523.9 , to $1,919.4 from $1,395.5 in fiscal 2017 , primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions. The incremental net revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business in the prior year comprised 23% of the total percentage change in net revenues for the segment, and incremental net revenues from the acquisition of ghd comprised 8% of the total percentage change in net revenues for the segment in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. Excluding the impacts of the Acquisitions, net revenues from the Professional Beauty segment increased 7% , or $94.2 to $1,473.7 in fiscal 2018, from $1,379.5 in fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting a positive foreign currency exchange translation impact of 5% , a positive price and mix impact of 2% , and no impact from unit volume. The increase in this segment primarily reflects higher net revenues from OPI driven by the launch of the OPI ProHealth GelColor System, an increase in the professional product line of Wella hair products due to the launch of WellaPlex and higher ghd net revenues primarily due to strong performance in Europe. In fiscal 2018, there was solid performance in Wella and other hair brands, as well as OPI and other nail products in both developed and emerging markets. In fiscal 2017 , net revenues from the Professional Beauty segment increased greater than 100%, or $1,145.5 , to $1,395.5 from $250.0 in fiscal 2016 , primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions. The acquisitions of the P&G Beauty Business and ghd comprised 74% and 10%, respectively, of the total net revenues for the segment. The professional product line of Wella hair products was the largest contributor to net revenues as a result of the P&G Beauty Business acquisition. Excluding the impacts of the Acquisitions and Divestitures, net revenues from the Professional Beauty segment decreased 12%, or $30.5 to $219.5 in fiscal 2017, from $250.0 in fiscal 2016, primarily reflecting the following activity related to OPI : (i) a decrease in unit volume of 8% as a result of declines from existing lacquer product lines, partially offset by an increase in volume of gel and long wear product lines, (ii) a negative price and mix impact of 3% as a result of unfavorable regional, channel and promotional mix and (iii) a negative foreign currency exchange translations impact of 1%. Net Revenues by Geographic Regions In addition to our reporting segments, net revenues by geographic regions are as follows. 35 Year Ended June 30, Change % (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 2018/2017 2017/2016 NET REVENUES North America $ 2,966.0 $ 2,506.9 $ 1,413.0 18 % 77 % Europe 4,201.6 3,325.7 1,924.6 26 % 73 % ALMEA 2,230.4 1,817.7 1,011.5 23 % 80 % Total $ 9,398.0 $ 7,650.3 $ 4,349.1 23 % 76 % North America In fiscal 2018 , net revenues in North America increased 18% or $459.1 , to $2,966.0 from $2,506.9 in fiscal 2017 , primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions. Excluding the impacts of the Acquisitions and Divestitures, net revenues in North America decreased 3% or $72.4 , to $2,420.9 in fiscal 2018 from $2,493.3 in fiscal 2017 , primarily due to declines in color cosmetics in the U.S. The decline in color cosmetics primarily reflects: (i) a decline in net revenues from CoverGirl due to declines in existing product lines, declines in the mass color cosmetics category and increased markdowns and trade spending associated with the CoverGirl brand relaunch which began in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, (ii) lower net revenues from Rimme l as declines in revenues from existing product lines offset current year launch activity. The decline in revenues in the region was partially offset by (i) higher revenues driven by the launches of the Tiffany & Co . and Gucci Bloom fragrances, and (ii) higher revenues in mass fragrances, primarily from Nautica due to an increased volume through value distribution channels. There was no impact from foreign currency exchange translations in fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2017 , net revenues in North America increased 77% or $1,093.9, to $2,506.9 from $1,413.0 in fiscal 2016, primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions. Excluding the impacts of the Acquisitions and Divestitures, net revenues in North America decreased 10% or $141.8, to $1,271.2 in fiscal 2017 from $1,413.0 in fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower net revenues in the U.S. from Sally Hansen , in part reflecting negative market trends in the retail nail market in the U.S., N.Y.C. New York Color and Rimmel in the Consumer Beauty division, as well as, OPI in the Professional Beauty division. There was no impact from foreign currency exchange translations in North America. Europe In fiscal 2018 , net revenues in Europe increased 26% , or 875.9 , to $4,201.6 from $3,325.7 in fiscal 2017 , primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions. Excluding the impacts of the Acquisitions and Divestitures, net revenues in Europe increased 8% , or $251.4 , to $3,542.8 in fiscal 2018 from $3,291.4 in fiscal 2017, primarily due to: (i) strong growth from prestige fragrances in Western Europe, (ii) incremental revenues from fragrances driven by the launches of the Tiffany & Co. and Gucci Bloom fragrances resulting in higher revenues in Western and Southern Europe, including the U.K., Spain, Italy, and Germany, and (iii) higher revenues from mass fragrances across the region. These increases were partially offset by declines in Playboy and Astor in Western Europe, including France and Germany. Excluding the impact of the Acquisitions, Divestitures and the positive foreign currency exchange translations impact of 8% , net revenues in Europe remained constant. In fiscal 2017 , net revenues in Europe increased 73% , or $1,401.1 , to $3,325.7 from $1,924.6 in fiscal 2016 , primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions. Excluding the impacts of the Acquisitions and Divestitures, net revenues in Europe decreased 13%, or $242.2, to $1,682.4 in fiscal 2017 from $1,924.6 in fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower net revenues from mass fragrances across the region as a result of a negative market trend in Europe, Rimmel in the U.K., Astor in Germany and Eastern Europe, Playboy in Germany, France, and Eastern Europe and adidas in the U.K. and Germany, partially offset by growth in Bourjois in Eastern Europe. Excluding the impact of the Acquisitions, Divestitures and the negative foreign currency exchange translations impact of 4%, net revenues in Europe decreased 9%. ALMEA In fiscal 2018 , net revenues in ALMEA increased 23% , or $412.7 , to $2,230.4 from $1,817.7 in fiscal 2017 , primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions. Excluding the impacts of the Acquisitions and Divestitures, net revenues in ALMEA increased 9% , or $161.7 , to $1,961.0 in fiscal 2018 from $1,799.3 in fiscal 2017, primarily due to: (i) incremental revenues from fragrances, driven by the launches of the Tiffany & Co. and Gucci Bloom fragrances, (ii) higher revenues from mass fragrances in Southeast Asia, driven by Nautica , and (iii) higher revenues from color cosmetics, driven by Max Factor in China. These increases were partially offset by declines in Brazil in response to decreased sales discounts in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of the Acquisitions, Divestitures and the positive foreign currency exchange translations impact of 1% , net revenues in ALMEA increased 8% . In fiscal 2017 , net revenues in ALMEA increased 80% or $806.2 , to $1,817.7 from $1,011.5 in fiscal 2016 , primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions. Excluding the impacts of the Acquisitions and Divestitures, net revenues in ALMEA increased 2%, or $19.4, to $1,030.9 in fiscal 2017 from $1,011.5 in fiscal 2016, primarily due to the Hypermarcas Brands in 36 Brazil during the five months of the comparable periods, partially offset by declines in Calvin Klein in China and Marc Jacobs in our travel retail business in Latin America. Excluding the impact of the Acquisitions, Divestitures and the positive foreign currency exchange translations impact of 1%, net revenues in ALMEA increased 1%. COST OF SALES In fiscal 2018 , cost of sales increased 19% , or $579.9 , to $3,608.4 from $3,028.5 in fiscal 2017 , primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions. Cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 38.4% in fiscal 2018 from 39.6% in fiscal 2017 , resulting in a gross margin improvement of approximately 120 basis points, primarily reflecting: (i) lower cost related to acquired inventory step-up amortization in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, (ii) mix impact associated with the increased net revenue contribution from higher-margin Luxury and Professional Beauty products in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, in addition to (iii) the continued contribution from our supply chain savings program. These improvements were partially offset by the negative impact of accelerated depreciation of buildings and equipment associated with plant closures, distributor terminations and inventory artwork transition costs related to the Global Integration Activities (as later defined). In fiscal 2017 , cost of sales increased 73% , or $1,282.5 , to $3,028.5 from $1,746.0 in fiscal 2016 , primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions. Cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 39.6% in fiscal 2017 from 40.1% in fiscal 2016 , resulting in a gross margin improvement of approximately 50 basis points primarily reflecting the acquisitions of higher margin businesses in fiscal 2017 including the P&G Beauty Business and Younique and continued contribution from our supply chain savings program partially offset by: (i) the negative impact of the revaluation of acquired inventory from the Acquisitions, (ii) the negative impact of inventory buyback associated with distributor terminations relating to the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business and (iii) higher promotional and discounted pricing activity reported in net revenues. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES In fiscal 2018 , selling, general and administrative expenses increased 23% , or $949.6 , to $5,009.6 from $4,060.0 in fiscal 2017 , primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 53.3% in fiscal 2018 from 53.1% in fiscal 2017 . In fiscal 2017 , selling, general and administrative expenses increased greater than 100%, or $2,032.2 , to $4,060.0 from $2,027.8 in fiscal 2016 , primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 53.1% in fiscal 2017 from 46.6% in fiscal 2016 . Unfavorable and (favorable) basis point changes in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 as compared to the respective prior year periods, are comprised of the following: Year Ended June 30, (bps rounded to the nearest tenth) 2018/2017 2017/2016 Administrative costs 180 500 Advertising and consumer promotion costs (110 ) 240 Foreign currency exchange impact (50 ) Share-based compensation (40 ) Other selling, general, and administrative expenses (50 ) Total basis point unfavorable (favorable) change 20 650 In fiscal 2018 , the selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to higher administrative costs from: (i) incremental consulting and third-party outsourcing expenses and (ii) increased depreciation expense for technological infrastructure which was placed into service with the successful completion of the P&G Beauty Business transition services agreement in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The lower advertising and consumer promotion spending as a percentage of net revenues is primarily due to a shift in spending programs within our color cosmetics brands as the decrease in marketing spend, recorded in advertising and consumer promotion costs, was offset by an increase in in-store support, which is recorded as a reduction to net revenues. In fiscal 2017 , the selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to higher administrative costs as a result of consulting expenses and compensations costs incurred in the connection with the integration of the P&G Beauty Business and the new organizational structure in the Professional Beauty division where we acquired a large sales organization to service the salon business. The higher advertising and consumer promotion spending is 37 primarily due to the impact of the higher spending ratio for the P&G Beauty Business as compared with the Legacy-Coty business in fiscal 2016 and increased spending primarily supporting Rimmel, Sally Hansen, and Bourjois.

Corporate Corporate primarily includes corporate expenses not directly relating to our operating activities. These items are included in Corporate since we consider them to be corporate responsibilities, and these items are not used by our management to measure the underlying performance of the segments. Operating loss for Corporate was $485.8 , $935.5 and $289.2 in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , r espectively , as described under Adjusted Operating Income below.

Restructuring and Other Business Realignment Costs We periodically undertake activities to integrate, realign and restructure our business to streamline operations and optimize our cost structure. In connection with the acquisition of the Burberry Beauty Business, we recorded $3.9 of restructuring costs related to distributor terminations which have been recorded in Corporate. 40 We continue to analyze our cost structure, including opportunities to simplify and streamline operations. Independent of the Global Integration Activities (as defined below), we are considering a range of smaller initiatives and other cost reduction activities, which will combine and expand existing initiatives, in order to reduce fixed costs and enable further investment in the business (the 2018 Restructuring Actions ). We expect that the 2018 Restructuring Actions will result in pre-tax restructuring and related costs of approximately $250.0, out of which approximately $78.0 has been approved through fiscal 2018. In connection with the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business, we anticipate that we will incur a total of approximately $1.3 billion of operating expenses, including restructuring and related costs aimed at integrating and optimizing the combined organization ( Global Integration Activities ). We expect that the Global Integration Activities will result in pre-tax restructuring and related costs of approximately $700.0 to $800.0, out of which approximately $700.0 has been approved through fiscal 2018. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, our Board approved an expansion to the acquisition integration program in connection with the acquisition of the Bourjois (the Acquisition Integration Program ).

The settlement charge for fiscal 2017 is as a result of accelerating the recognition of losses previously deferred in other comprehensive income (loss). Pension settlement charges were reported in Corporate. Asset Impairment Charges In fiscal 2018 and 2017, we did not incur any asset impairment charges.

INTEREST EXPENSE, NET In fiscal 2018 , net interest expense was $265.0 as compared with $218.6 in fiscal 2017 . This increase is primarily a result of higher average debt balances and increased average interest rates. In fiscal 2017 , net interest expense was $218.6 as compared with $81.9 in fiscal 2016 .This increase is primarily a result of higher average debt balances at increased interest rates due to the assumption of debt under the Galleria Credit Agreement and 42 the financings of the acquisitions of ghd and Younique. Additionally included in the prior period interest expense is a onetime foreign currency exchange gain of $11.1 related to our debt refinancing in fiscal 2016. LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT In fiscal 2018 , we incurred $10.7 in losses related to the write-off of debt discount and deferred financing costs in connection with the refinancing of our credit agreement entered into on October 27, 2017 (the Coty Credit Agreement ) and the debt facilities available under the Galleria Credit Agreement (the Galleria Credit Agreement ).

The other expense in fiscal 2018 primarily includes $24.1 in expense related to third-party debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the refinancing of the Coty Credit Agreement and Galleria Credit Agreement and $12.5 related to the change in the Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instrument ( MRFI ) balance primarily associated with a certain Southeast Asian subsidiary. In fiscal 2017 , we incurred $1.6 million of net other expense. In fiscal 2016 , we incurred $30.4 million of net other expense related to losses incurred of $29.6 on foreign currency contracts related to payments to Hypermarcas S.A. in connection with the acquisition of the Hypermarcas Brands and expenses of $0.8 related to the purchase of the remaining mandatorily redeemable financial instrument in a subsidiary. INCOME TAXES The following table presents our (benefit) provision for income taxes, and effective tax rates for the periods presented 2018 2017 2016 (Benefit) provision for income taxes $ (24.7 ) $ (259.5 ) $ (40.4 ) Effective income tax rate 16.2 % 39.4 % (29.1 )% The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 16.2% as compared with 39.4% in fiscal 2017 and (29.1)% in fiscal 2016 . The effective income tax rate in fiscal 2018 includes an expense of $41.0 as a result of the Tax Act. This expense is due to the one-time deemed repatriation tax offset by a tax benefit on the revaluation of the Company deferred taxes. See Note 15 Income Taxes in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The effective income tax rate in fiscal 2017 includes the release of a valuation allowance in the U.S. as a result of the P&G Beauty Business acquisition of $111.2. The negative effective income tax rate in fiscal 2016 reflects a change in recognized tax benefit of $51.4 due to the settlement of tax audits in multiple jurisdictions and the expiration of foreign and state statutes of limitation. The effective rates vary from the U.S. federal statutory rate of approximately 28% due to the effect of (i) jurisdictions with different statutory rates, (ii) adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest, (iii) non-deductible expenses, (iv) audit settlements and (v) valuation allowance changes. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. 43 Reconciliation of Reported (Loss) Income Before Income Taxes to Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates: Year Ended June 30, 2018 Year Ended June 30, 2017 Year Ended June 30, 2016 (in millions) (Loss)/ income before income taxes (Benefit)provision for income taxes Effective tax rate (Loss)/ income before income taxes (Benefit)provision for income taxes Effective tax rate Income before income taxes (Benefit)provision for income taxes Effective tax rate Reported (loss) income before income taxes $ (152.5 ) (24.7 ) 16.2 % $ (658.0 ) (259.5 ) 39.4 % $ 138.8 (40.4 ) (29.1 )% Adjustments to reported operating income (loss) (a) (b) 838.6 152.5 1,210.6 355.0 368.7 50.7 Other adjustments (b) (c) 33.4 10.4 1.4 0.4 9.6 (0.7 ) Adjusted income before income taxes $ 719.5 $ 138.2 19.2 % $ 554.0 $ 95.9 17.3 % $ 517.1 $ 9.6 1.9 % (a) See a description of adjustments under Adjusted Operating Income for Coty Inc. (b) The tax effects of each of the items included in adjusted income are calculated in a manner that results in a corresponding income tax benefit/provision for adjusted income. In preparing the calculation, each adjustment to reported income is first analyzed to determine if the adjustment has an income tax consequence. The benefit/provision for taxes is then calculated based on the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are incurred, multiplied by the respective statutory rates and offset by the increase or reversal of any valuation allowances commensurate with the non-GAAP measure of profitability (c) See Reconciliation of Reported Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Coty Inc. to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Coty Inc. The adjusted effective tax rate was 19.2% compared to 17.3% in the prior-year period. The differences were primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance in the US in the prior period as a result of the P&G Beauty Business acquisition. Cash paid during the years ended June 30, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , for income taxes of $124.6 , $90.1 and $118.1 represents 17.3% , 16.3% and 22.8% of Adjusted income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended, respectively. NET (LOSS) INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COTY INC. In fiscal 2018 , net loss attributable to Coty Inc. decreased $253.4 to a loss of $168.8 from a loss of $422.2 in fiscal 2017 . This decrease primarily reflects higher operating income partially offset by higher interest expense in fiscal 2018 and incremental costs related to the loss on early extinguishment of debt and other debt issuance costs. In fiscal 2017 , net loss attributable to Coty Inc. increased $579.1 to a loss of $422.2 , from income of $156.9 in fiscal 2016 . This decrease primarily reflects lower operating income and higher interest expense in fiscal 2017, partially offset by a higher tax benefit in the fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016 and losses related to hedges on the acquisition of the Hypermarcas Brands in fiscal 2016. We believe that adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. provides an enhanced understanding of our performance.

FINANCIAL CONDITION LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview As of June 30, 2018 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $331.6 compared with $535.4 at June 30, 2017 . Our cash and cash equivalents balances decreased by $203.8 during fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of cash used for capital expenditures, dividend payments to shareholders and acquisitions, partially offset by cash generated from operations and net borrowings from long-term debt. During fiscal 2018 , we reduced our cash held outside of the U.S. by $168.8, which was utilized for corporate purposes. Our cash flows are subject to seasonal variation throughout the year, including demands on cash made during our first fiscal quarter in anticipation of higher global sales during the second fiscal quarter and strong cash generation in the second fiscal quarter as a result of increased demand by retailers associated with the holiday season. Our principal uses of cash are to fund planned operating expenditures, capital expenditures, interest payments, acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases and any principal payments on debt. The working capital movements are based on the sourcing of materials related to the 46 production of products within each of our segments. The phasing of payments to vendors also impacts our working capital from time-to-time as we seek to efficiently manage our cash and working capital requirements. As a result of the cash on hand, our ability to generate cash from operations and through access to our revolving credit facility and other lending sources, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our ongoing needs on both a near term and long-term basis. Debt The balances consisted of the following as of June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 , respectively: June 30, 2018 June 30, 2017 Short-term debt $ 9.2 $ 3.7 2018 Coty Credit Agreement 2018 Coty Revolving Credit Facility due April 2023 368.1 2018 Coty Term A Facility due April 2023 3,371.5 2018 Coty Term B Facility due April 2025 2,390.5 Senior Unsecured Notes 2026 Dollar Notes due April 2026 550.0 2023 Euro Notes due April 2023 640.9 2026 Euro Notes due April 2026 291.4 Galleria Credit Agreement Galleria Revolving Credit Facility due September 2021 Galleria Term Loan A Facility due September 2021 944.3 Galleria Term Loan B Facility due September 2023 1,000.0 Coty Credit Agreement Coty Revolving Credit Facility due October 2020 810.0 Coty Term Loan A Facility due October 2020 1,792.8 Coty Term Loan A Facility due October 2021 950.6 Coty Term Loan B Facility due October 2022 1,712.5 Other long-term debt and capital lease obligations 1.6 1.7 Total debt 7,623.2 7,215.6 Less: Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt (218.9 ) (209.1 ) Total Long-term debt 7,404.3 7,006.5 Less: Unamortized debt issuance costs (a) (b) (86.2 ) (67.6 ) Less: Discount on Long-term debt (12.7 ) (10.6 ) Total Long-term debt, net $ 7,305.4 $ 6,928.3 (a) Balances as of June 30, 2018 consist of unamortized debt issuance costs of $31.4 for the 2018 Coty Revolving Credit Facility, $29.2 for the 2018 Coty Term A Facility, $10.9 for the 2018 Coty Term B Facility, $8.3 for the 2026 Dollar and Euro Notes and $6.4 for the 2023 Euro Notes.

Offering of Senior Unsecured Notes On April 5, 2018 we issued, at par, $550.0 of 6.50% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the 2026 Dollar Notes ), 550.0 million of 4.00% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the 2023 Euro Notes ) and 250.0 million of 4.75% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the 2026 Euro Notes and, together with the 2023 Euro Notes, the Euro Notes, and the Euro Notes together with the 2026 Dollar Notes, the Senior Unsecured Notes ) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities 48 Act. The net proceeds of this offering, together with borrowings under our 2018 Credit Agreement were used to repay in full and refinance the indebtedness outstanding under the 2015 Coty Credit Agreement and Galleria Credit Agreement and to pay accrued interest, related premiums, fees and expenses in connection therewith. The Senior Unsecured Notes are our senior unsecured debt obligations and will be pari passu in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior indebtedness (including the 2018 Coty Credit Facilities described below). The Senior Unsecured Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior basis by the Guarantors (as later defined under 2018 Coty Credit Agreement ). The Senior Unsecured Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and are effectively junior to all our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness. The related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each Guarantor and are effectively junior to all existing and future secured indebtedness of such Guarantor to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. In addition to the optional redemption outlined below, we may, at our option, redeem either series of the Euro Notes, in whole but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Euro Notes to be redeemed, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date, at any time, upon the occurrence of certain tax events. Upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events with respect to a series of Senior Unsecured Notes, we will be required to offer to repurchase all or part of the Senior Unsecured Notes of such series at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the purchase date applicable to such Senior Unsecured Notes. The Notes contain customary covenants that place restrictions in certain circumstances on, among other things, incurrence of liens, entry into sale or leaseback transactions, sales of all or substantially all of our assets and certain merger or consolidation transactions. The Notes also provide for customary events of default. Optional Redemption Applicable Premium The indenture governing the Senior Unsecured Notes (the Indenture ) specifies the Applicable Premium (as defined in the Indenture) to be paid upon early redemption of some or all of the 2026 Dollar Notes, 2023 Euro Notes or 2026 Euro Notes.

The 2018 Coty Credit Agreement provides for (a) our incurrence of (1) a senior secured term A facility in an aggregate principal amount of (i) $1,000.0 denominated in U.S. dollars and (ii) 2,035.0 million denominated in euros (the 2018 Coty Term A Facility ) and (2) a senior secured term B facility in an aggregate principal amount of (i) $1,400.0 denominated in U.S. dollars and (ii) 850.0 million denominated in euros (the 2018 Coty Term B Facility ) and (b) the incurrence by us and Coty B.V., a Dutch subsidiary of ours (the Dutch Borrower and, together with us, the Borrowers ), of a senior secured revolving facility in an aggregate principal amount of $3,250.0 denominated in U.S. dollars, specified alternative currencies or other currencies freely convertible into U.S. dollars and readily available in the London interbank market (the 2018 Coty Revolving Credit Facility ) (the 2018 Coty Term A Facility, together with the 2018 Coty Term B Facility and the 2018 Coty Revolving Credit Facility, the 2018 Coty Credit Facilities ). Initial borrowings under the 2018 Coty Term Loan B Facility were issued at a 0.250% discount. The 2018 Coty Credit Agreement provides that with respect to the 2018 Coty Revolving Credit Facility, up to $150.0 is available for letters of credit and up to $150.0 is available for swing line loans. The 2018 Coty Credit Agreement also permits, subject to certain terms and conditions, the incurrence of incremental facilities thereunder in an aggregate amount of (i) $1,700.0 plus (ii) an unlimited amount if the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement), at the time of incurrence of such incremental facilities and after giving effect thereto on a pro forma basis, is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00. The net proceeds of the Senior Unsecured Notes and the 2018 Coty Credit Facilities were used to repay in full and refinance the indebtedness outstanding under the 2015 Coty Credit Agreement and Galleria Credit Agreement and to pay accrued interest, related premiums, fees and expenses in connection therewith. Future borrowings under the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement could be used for corporate purposes. Our obligations under the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our material wholly-owned subsidiaries organized in the U.S., subject to certain exceptions (the Guarantors ) and the obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement are secured by a perfected first priority lien (subject to permitted liens) on substantially all of ours and the Guarantors assets, subject to certain exceptions. The Dutch Borrower does not guarantee our obligations under the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement or grant any liens on its assets to secure any obligations under the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement. See Note 13 Debt in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our prior period credit agreements. Interest The 2018 Coty Credit Agreement facilities bears interest at rates equal to, at our option, either: LIBOR of the applicable qualified currency, of which the we can elect the applicable one, two, three, six or twelve month rate, plus the applicable margin; or 50 ABR plus the applicable margin. In the case of the 2018 Coty Revolving Credit Facility and the 2018 Coty Term A Facility, the applicable margin means the lesser of a percentage per annum to be determined in accordance with the leverage-based pricing grid and the debt rating-based grid below: Pricing Tier Total Net Leverage Ratio: LIBOR plus: Alternative Base Rate Margin: 1.0 Greater than or equal to 4.75:1 2.000% 1.000% 2.0 Less than 4.75:1 but greater than or equal to 4.00:1 1.750% 0.750% 3.0 Less than 4.00:1 but greater than or equal to 2.75:1 1.500% 0.500% 4.0 Less than 2.75:1 but greater than or equal to 2.00:1 1.250% 0.250% 5.0 Less than 2.00:1 but greater than or equal to 1.50:1 1.125% 0.125% 6.0 Less than 1.50:1 1.000% % Pricing Tier Debt Ratings S&P/Moody s: LIBOR plus: Alternative Base Rate Margin: 5.0 Less than BB+/Ba1 2.000% 1.000% 4.0 BB+/Ba1 1.750% 0.750% 3.0 BBB-/Baa3 1.500% 0.500% 2.0 BBB/Baa2 1.250% 0.250% 1.0 BBB+/Baa1 or higher 1.125% 0.125% In the case of the USD portion of the 2018 Coty Term B Facility, the applicable margin means 2.25% per annum, in the case of LIBOR loans, and 1.25% per annum, in the case of ABR loans.

Debt Maturities Schedule Aggregate maturities of all long-term debt, including current portion of long-term debt and excluding capital lease obligations as of June 30, 2018 , are presented below: Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2019 $ 192.5 2020 192.5 2021 192.5 2022 192.5 2023 3,730.1 Thereafter 3,112.3 Total $ 7,612.4 Covenants The 2018 Coty Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants include, among other things, limitations on debt, liens, dispositions, investments, fundamental changes, restricted payments and affiliate transactions. With certain exceptions as described below, the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined below), equal to or less than the ratios shown below for each respective test period. 51 Quarterly Test Period Ending Total Net Leverage Ratio (a) June 30, 2018 5.50 to 1.00 September 30, 2018 through December 31, 2018 5.50 to 1.00 March 31, 2019 through June 30, 2019 5.25 to 1.00 September 30, 2019 through December 31, 2019 5.00 to 1.00 March 31, 2020 through June 30, 2020 4.75 to 1.00 September 30, 2020 through December 31, 2020 4.50 to 1.00 March 31, 2021 through June 30, 2021 4.25 to 1.00 September 30, 2021 through June 30, 2023 4.00 to 1.00 (a) Total Net Leverage Ratio means, as of any date of determination, the ratio of: (a) (i) Total Indebtedness minus (ii) unrestricted cash and Cash Equivalents of the Parent Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries as determined in accordance with GAAP to (b) Adjusted EBITDA for the most recently ended Test Period (each of the defined terms used within the definition of Total Net Leverage Ratio have the meanings ascribed to them within the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement). In the four fiscal quarters following the closing of any Material Acquisition (as defined in the 2018 Coty Credit Agreement), including the fiscal quarter in which such Material Acquisition occurs, the maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio shall be the lesser of (i) 5.95 to 1.00 and (ii) 1.00 higher than the otherwise applicable maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio for such quarter (as set forth in the table above). Immediately after any such four fiscal quarter period, there shall be at least two consecutive fiscal quarters during which our Total Net Leverage Ratio is no greater than the maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio that would otherwise have been required in the absence of such Material Acquisition, regardless of whether any additional Material Acquisitions are consummated during such period. Business Combinations Burberry Beauty Business Acquisition On October 2, 2017, we acquired the exclusive global license rights and other related assets for the Burberry Limited ( Burberry ) luxury fragrances, cosmetics and skincare business (the Burberry Beauty Business ). The Burberry Beauty Business acquisition is expected to further strengthen our position in the global luxury beauty industry. Total purchase consideration, after post-closing adjustments, was 191.7 million , the equivalent of $256.3 , at the time of closing. Included in the purchase price was cash consideration of 183.3 million , the equivalent of $245.1 , at the time of closing, in addition to 8.4 million , the equivalent of $11.2 , of estimated contingent consideration, at the time of closing. P&G Beauty Business Acquisition On October 1, 2016, we acquired the P&G Beauty Business. The P&G Beauty Business further strengthens our position in the global beauty industry. The purchase price was $11,570.4 and consisted of $9,628.6 of total equity consideration and $1,941.8 of assumed debt. We issued 409.7 million shares of common stock to the former holders of Galleria Co. ( Galleria ) (which held the assets of the P&G Beauty Business) common stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares. Coty Inc. is considered to be the acquiring company for accounting purposes. Acquisition of ghd On November 21, 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interest of Lion/Gloria Topco Limited, which held the assets of ghd ( ghd ) which stands for Good Hair Day , a premium brand in high-end hair styling appliances, pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement. The ghd acquisition further strengthens our professional hair category. The total cash consideration paid net of acquired cash and cash equivalents was 430.2 million , the equivalent of $531.5 , at the time of closing. Acquisition of Younique On February 1, 2017, we completed our acquisition of 60% of the membership interest in Foundation, LLC ( Foundation ), which held the net assets of Younique, LLC, a Utah limited liability company ( Younique ), for cash consideration of $600.0 , net of acquired cash and debt assumed, and an additional payment of $7.5 for working capital adjustments paid in the first half of fiscal 2018. The existing Younique membership holders contributed their 100% membership interest in Younique to Foundation in exchange for a 40% membership interest in Foundation and $607.5 of cash consideration. Younique strengthens the Consumer Beauty division color cosmetics and skin and body care product offerings. We account for the noncontrolling interest portion of the acquisition as a redeemable noncontrolling interest. Refer to Note 20 52 Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests for information regarding valuation method and significant assumptions used to calculate the fair value. Hypermarcas Brands Acquisition On February 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the net assets of the personal care and beauty business of Hypermarcas S.A. (the Hypermarcas Brands ) pursuant to a share purchase agreement in order to further strengthen our position in the Brazilian beauty and personal care market. This acquisition was included in the Consumer Beauty segment. The total consideration of R$3,599.5 million , the equivalent of $901.9 , at the time of closing, was paid during fiscal 2016. Dispositions During fiscal 2018, we divested the Playboy and Cerruti brands and related assets for total proceeds of $33.0 . We allocated $12.3 of goodwill to these brands as part of the sale. We recorded a non-cash loss of $28.6 which has been reflected in Loss (gain) on sale of assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. During fiscal 2017, we sold assets of the J.Lo brand for a total purchase price of $10.5 . We allocated $2.4 of goodwill to the brand as part of the sale. We recorded a gain of $3.1 which has been reflected in Loss (gain) on sale of assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. During fiscal 2016, we sold the Cutex brand and related assets for a total disposal price of $29.2 . We allocated $4.2 of goodwill to the brand as part of the sale. We recorded a gain of $24.8 which has been reflected in Loss (gain) on sale of assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Cash Flows Year Ended June 30, 2018 2017 2016 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data: (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 413.7 $ 757.5 $ 501.4 Net cash (used in) investing activities (687.6 ) (1,163.6 ) (1,059.2 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 69.3 595.2 592.6 Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $413.7 , $757.5 and $501.4 for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The decrease in operating cash inflows in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was $343.8 . This decrease is primarily due to an increase in cash outflows related to working capital of $907.1, partially offset by an increase in net income after adjusting for non-cash items of $573.3. Working capital changes in fiscal 2018 generated cash outflows of $110.2, compared with generating cash inflows of $796.9 in fiscal 2017. The working capital cash inflows in fiscal 2017 included the impact of (i) an increase in accounts payable in fiscal 2017 due to implementing significantly longer Coty payment terms to the vendors associated with the P&G Beauty Business, as compared to the prior P&G payment terms and (ii) an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in fiscal 2017 due to the establishment of accruals for the Global Integration Activities along with incrementally larger accruals resulting from the larger combined business subsequent to the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business. The working capital cash outflows in fiscal 2018 included the positive impact of the phasing of payments to vendors. The increase in net income after adjusting for non-cash items in fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017, resulted primarily from changes in the net loss, deferred income taxes and depreciation and amortization from recent acquisitions. The increase in operating cash inflows in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was $256.1 . This increase is primarily due to an increase of $687.0 resulting from the change in operating assets and liabilities acquired in the P&G Beauty Business acquisition, coupled with changes in working capital. The increase in accounts payable during fiscal 2017 was primarily due to implementing significantly longer Coty payment terms to the vendors associated with the P&G Beauty Business, as compared to the prior P&G payment terms. The increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities during fiscal 2017 resulted primarily from the establishment of the restructuring accrual for the Global Integration Activities along with incrementally larger accruals (e.g., accruals for advertising and marketing expenditures, for customer rebates and for compensation and other related employee benefits) resulting from the larger combined business subsequent to the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business. In addition, the increase also included a change of $323.1 for depreciation and amortization as a result of the new acquisitions. This is offset by a decrease in deferred income tax of $250.8 primarily due to a release of valuation allowance as a result of the P&G Beauty Business acquisition and a decrease of $577.7 in Net income (loss). Net cash used in investing activities 53 Net cash used in investing activities was $(687.6) , $(1,163.6) and $(1,059.2) for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The decrease in cash outflows of $476.0 was primarily due to lower cash payments for business combinations of $464.6. The business combinations in the current period included $245.1 for the Burberry Beauty Business, $25.4 for other acquisitions and $7.5 of net working capital adjustments from the Younique acquisition previously accrued for and paid in the current period. The increase in cash outflows in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 of $104.4 is primarily driven by higher cash payments for capital projects of $282.2 , partially offset by a decrease of $166.1 for net payments in connection with the P&G Beauty Business, ghd and Younique acquisitions. Net cash provided by financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $69.3 , $595.2 and $592.6 for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The decrease in cash inflows of $525.9 was primarily due to lower net borrowings of debt of $521.1, higher debt issuance costs of $30.7 and higher distributions to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests of $24.1. These amounts were partially offset by lower repurchases of Class A Common Stock held as Treasury Stock of $36.3. The increase in cash inflows in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 of $2.6 is primarily driven by a decrease of $758.6 in payments for Class A Common Stock compared to the prior year, partially offset by an increase of $474.0 in net repayments of short term debt, the revolving loan and term loan facilities and an increase of $283.6 in cash dividends paid. Dividends Prior to October 2016, we declared annual cash dividends in the first quarter of the fiscal year. Beginning after October 2016, we began declaring cash dividends on a quarterly basis. The following dividends were declared during fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : Declaration Date Dividend Type Dividend Per Share Holders of Record Date Dividend Value Dividend Payment Date Dividends Paid Dividends Payable Fiscal 2018 August 22, 2017 Quarterly $ 0.125 September 1, 2017 $ 94.4 September 14, 2017 $ 93.6 $ 0.8 November 9, 2017 Quarterly $ 0.125 November 30, 2017 $ 94.6 December 14, 2017 $ 93.7 $ 0.9 February 8, 2018 Quarterly $ 0.125 February 28, 2018 $ 94.6 March 15, 2018 $ 93.8 $ 0.8 May 9, 2018 Quarterly $ 0.125 May 31, 2018 $ 94.6 June 14, 2018 $ 93.8 $ 0.8 Fiscal 2018 $ 0.500 $ 378.2 $ 374.9 $ 3.3 Fiscal 2017 August 1, 2016 Annual $ 0.275 August 11, 2016 $ 93.4 August 19, 2016 $ 92.4 $ 1.0 December 9, 2016 Quarterly $ 0.125 December 19, 2016 $ 94.0 December 28, 2016 $ 93.4 $ 0.6 February 9, 2017 Quarterly $ 0.125 February 28, 2017 $ 94.0 March 10, 2017 $ 93.4 $ 0.6 May 10, 2017 Quarterly $ 0.125 May 31, 2017 $ 94.0 June 13, 2017 $ 93.4 $ 0.6 Fiscal 2017 $ 0.650 $ 375.4 $ 372.6 $ 2.8 Fiscal 2016 September 11, 2015 Annual $ 0.250 October 1, 2015 $ 90.1 October 15, 2015 $ 89.0 $ 1.1 Treasury Stock - Share Repurchase Program Since February 2014, the Board has authorized us to repurchase our Class A Common Stock under approved repurchase programs. Repurchases may be made from time to time at our discretion, based, among other things, on ongoing assessments of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our Class A Common Stock, our deleveraging strategy, and general market conditions. As of June 30, 2018 , we had $396.8 remaining under the current repurchase program that was approved by our Board on February 3, 2016. The following table summarizes the share repurchase activities during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 : 54 Period Number of shares repurchased (in millions) Cost of shares repurchased (in millions) Lowest fair value of shares repurchased per share Highest fair value of shares repurchased per share Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018 $ $ $ Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 1.4 $ 36.3 $ 25.35 $ 27.40 Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2016 27.4 $ 767.0 $ 25.10 $ 30.35 Treasury Stock - Other Repurchases In addition to the above mentioned repurchase activities, on December 3, 2015, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with a shareholder holding more than 5% of our Class A Common Stock to repurchase 1.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock. On December 17, 2015, we remitted payment for the repurchased shares at a price of $27.91 per share. The fair value of shares repurchased was approximately $27.9, which was recorded as an increase to Treasury stock in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our principal contractual obligations and commitments as of June 30, 2018 are presented below: (in millions) Total Payments Due in Fiscal Thereafter 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Long-term debt obligations $ 7,612.4 $ 192.5 $ 192.5 $ 192.5 $ 192.5 $ 3,730.1 $ 3,112.3 Interest on long-term debt obligations (a) 2,577.0 281.0 304.4 333.9 365.8 367.1 924.8 Operating lease obligations 829.5 128.9 112.1 97.0 80.4 71.8 339.3 License agreements: (b) Royalty payments 673.9 126.0 85.3 63.0 46.7 47.9 305.0 Advertising and promotional spend obligations 0.7 0.7 Other contractual obligations (c) 418.2 258.8 60.2 55.1 34.5 7.7 1.9 Other long-term obligations: Pension obligations (mandated) (d) 87.6 19.0 18.2 17.4 16.8 16.2 Total $ 12,199.3 $ 1,006.9 $ 772.7 $ 758.9 $ 736.7 $ 4,240.8 $ 4,683.3 (a) Interest costs on our debt after consideration of our interest rate swap arrangements are determined based on interest rate forecast and assumptions of the amount of debt outstanding. A 25 basis-point increase in our variable interest rate debt would have increased our interest costs by $103.1 over the term of our long-term debt. (b) Obligations under license agreements relate to royalty payments and required advertising and promotional spending levels for our products bearing the licensed trademark. Royalty payments are typically made based on contractually defined net sales. However, certain licenses require minimum guaranteed royalty payments regardless of sales levels. Minimum guaranteed royalty payments and required minimums for advertising and promotional spending have been included in the table above. Actual royalty payments and advertising and promotional spending are expected to be higher. Furthermore, early termination of any of these license agreements could result in potential cash outflows that have not been reflected above. (c) Other contractual obligations primarily represent advertising/marketing, manufacturing, logistics and capital improvements commitments. Additionally, we have included the mandatorily redeemable financial instruments arising out of our subsidiaries as discussed in Note 19 Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Interest . We also maintain several distribution agreements for which early termination could result in potential future cash outflows that have not been reflected above. (d) Represents future contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans over the next five years mandated by local regulations or statutes. Subsequent funding requirements cannot be reasonably estimated as the return on plan assets in future periods, as well as future assumptions are not known. The table above excludes obligations for uncertain tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of $135.4 as of June 30, 2018 , as we are unable to predict when, or if, any payments would be made. See Note 15 Income Taxes in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our uncertain tax benefits. The table excludes $661.3 of RNCI which is reflected in Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2018 related to our 25.0% RNCI in our subsidiary in the Middle East ( Middle East Subsidiary ) and our 40.6% interest in Foundation. Given the provisions of the associated Put and Call rights, both RNCI are redeemable outside of our control and are recorded in temporary equity. 55 See Note 20 Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion related to the calculation of the redemption value for each of these noncontrolling interests. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities We are exposed to foreign currency exchange fluctuations and interest rate volatility through our global operations. We utilize natural offsets to the fullest extent possible in order to identify net exposures. In the normal course of business, established policies and procedures are employed to manage these net exposures using a variety of financial instruments. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Management We operate in multiple functional currencies and are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For foreign currency exposures, which primarily relate to receivables, inventory purchases and sales, payables and intercompany loans, derivatives are used to better manage the earnings and cash flow volatility arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We recorded foreign currency losses of $3.9 , $1.5 and $7.2 in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, resulting from non-financing foreign currency exchange transactions which are included in their associated expense type and are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net gains (losses) of $8.5 , $(12.8) and $19.2 in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, resulting from financing foreign exchange currency transactions are included in Interest expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net (losses) of nil , $(1.7) and $(29.4) in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, resulting from acquisition-related foreign exchange currency transactions are included in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Exchange gains or losses are also partially offset through the use of qualified derivatives under hedge accounting, for which we record accumulated gains or losses in Accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction occurs at which time the gain or loss is reclassified into the respective account in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of balance sheet transactional exposures. As of June 30, 2018 , in the event of a 10.0% unfavorable change in the prevailing market rates of hedged foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, the change in fair value of all foreign exchange forward contracts would result in a $26.3 increase in the fair value of the forward contracts. In the view of management, these hypothetical gains resulting from an assumed change in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial statement position or results of operations. This gain does not include the impact on our underlying foreign currency exposures. Interest Rate Risk Management We are exposed to interest rate risk that relates primarily to our indebtedness, which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates primarily in the U.S. and Europe. We periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to facilitate our interest rate management activities. We have designated these agreements as cash flow hedges and, accordingly, applied hedge accounting. The effective changes in fair value of these agreements are recorded in AOCI/(L), net of tax, and ineffective portions are recorded in current- period earnings. Amounts in AOCI/(L) are subsequently reclassified to earnings as interest expense when the hedged transactions are settled. We expect that both at the inception and on an ongoing basis, the hedging relationship between any designated interest rate hedges and underlying variable rate debt will be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively. The corresponding gain or loss position of the ineffective hedge recorded to AOCI/(L) will be reclassified to current-period earnings. If interest rates had been 10% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, (Loss) income before income taxes in fiscal 2018 would decrease/increase by $25.2 . During August 2018, we extended the maturity of our interest rate swap portfolio, in order to maintain a 50:50 ratio of fixed to floating rate debt through 2021 to better manage our medium term exposure to interest rate increases. Looking forward, we expect that the fixed to floating rate debt ratio will improve as we reduce the notional value of our floating rate debt. We intend to continue to target a 50:50 euro to U.S. dollar liability split under our long term debt agreements which would match our underlying cash inflows, to manage our exposure to foreign exchange risk in the financial markets. 56 Credit Risk Management We attempt to minimize credit exposure to counterparties by generally entering into derivative contracts with counterparties that have an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the fair value of contracts in net asset positions, which totaled $44.6 as of June 30, 2018 . Accordingly, management believes risk of material loss under these hedging contracts is remote. Inflation Risk To date, we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures in the future, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, as well as the trading price of our securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2018 and 2017 . Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results may differ from those estimates that would result in material changes to our operating results and financial condition. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, the assessment of goodwill, other intangible and long-lived assets for impairment, business combinations, inventory, pension benefit costs, income taxes and redeemable noncontrolling interests. Our management has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when realized or realizable and earned. Our policy is to recognize revenue when risk of loss and title to the product transfers to the customer, which usually occurs upon delivery. Net revenues comprise gross revenues less customer discounts and allowances, actual and expected returns (estimated based on returns history and position in product life cycle) and various trade spending activities. Trade spending activities relate to advertising, product promotions and demonstrations, some of which involve cooperative relationships with customers. Returns represent 2% , 2% and 3% of gross revenue after customer discounts and allowances in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Trade spending activities recorded as a reduction to gross revenue after customer discounts and allowances represent 8% , 7% , and 8% in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Our sales return accrual reflects seasonal fluctuations, including those related to the holiday season in our second quarter. This accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net revenues, and is calculated based on history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels. In addition, as necessary, specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events. The types of known or anticipated events that we have considered, and will continue to consider, include the financial condition of our customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment, and our decision to continue to support new and existing brands. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not approximate future returns, additional allowances may be required. Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Goodwill Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets. Other intangible assets consist of indefinite-lived trademarks. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. We assess goodwill at least annually as of May 1 for impairment, or more frequently, if certain events or circumstances warrant. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the same level as our reportable segments. We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our reporting segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components. 57 When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as the basis to determine if it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. In performing our qualitative assessment, we consider the extent to which unfavorable events or circumstances identified, such as changes in economic conditions, industry and market conditions or company specific events, could affect the comparison of the reporting unit fair value with its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test. Quantitative impairment testing for goodwill is performed in two steps: (i) the determination of possible impairment, based upon the fair value of a reporting unit as compared to its carrying value; and (ii) if there is a possible impairment indicated, this step measures the amount of impairment loss, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for our reporting units. Testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and assumptions. The assumptions made will impact the outcome and ultimate results of the testing. We use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and, in certain instances, we engage independent third-party valuation specialists for advice. To determine fair value of the reporting unit, we used a combination of the income and market approaches. We believe the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risk associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis, and this combination is indicative of the factors a market participant would consider when performing a similar valuation. Under the income approach, we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows. Under the market approach, we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, which creates valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting units being tested, to value the reporting unit. The key estimates and factors used in these approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on our internal forecasts, our specific weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows, and comparable market multiples for the industry segment as well as our historical operating trends. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in actual and expected consumer consumption and demands, could result in changes to these assumptions and judgments. A revision of these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values. We would then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of any non-cash impairment charge. Such charge could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Balance Sheets. There were no impairments of goodwill at our reporting units in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016. Based on the annual impairment test performed at May 1, 2018, we determined that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values at that date by a range of approximately 20.1% to 97.6%. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we have used expected growth rates that are in line with expected market growth rates for the respective product categories and include a discount rate of 7.25%. We believe the assumptions used in calculating the estimated fair value of the reporting units are reasonable. However, we can provide no assurances that we will achieve such projected results. Further, we can provide no assurances that we will not have to recognize additional impairment of goodwill in the future due to other market conditions or changes in our discount rates. Recognition of additional impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill would negatively affect our reported results of our operations and total capitalization. Other Intangible Assets We assess indefinite-lived other intangible assets (trademarks) at least annually as of May 1 for impairment, or more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. Trademarks are tested for impairment on a brand level basis. The trademarks fair values are based upon the income approach, primarily utilizing the relief from royalty methodology. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset. An impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. Fair value calculation requires significant judgments in determining both the assets estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value. Variations in the economic conditions or a change in general consumer demands, operating results estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. 58 On May 1, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , we performed our annual impairment testing of indefinite-lived other intangible assets and determined that no adjustments to carrying values were required. The carrying value of our indefinite-lived other intangible assets was $3,186.2 as of June 30, 2018 , and is comprised of trademarks for the following brands: OPI of $664.9, CoverGirl of $610.0, the professional product line of Wella of $440.0, Max Factor of $340.0, philosophy of $274.2, Sally Hansen of $184.5, ghd of $158.2, and other trademarks totaling $514.4. As of May 1, 2018, we determined that the fair value of our ghd trademark exceeded its carrying value by approximately 7% using projections that assumed an average revenue growth rate of 4.7% and discount rate of 9.25%. The fair value of the ghd trademark would fall below its carrying value if the average annual revenue growth rate decreased by approximately 106 basis points or the discount rate increased by 75 basis points. The fair values of the remaining indefinite-lived trademarks exceeded their carrying values by amounts ranging from 13.0% to 100%. We believe the assumptions used in calculating the estimated fair value of the trademarks are reasonable and attainable. However, we can provide no assurances that we will not have to recognize additional impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the future due to other market conditions or changes in our discount rates. Recognition of additional impairment of a significant portion of our indefinite-lived intangible assets would negatively affect our reported results of operations and total capitalization. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, including tangible and intangible assets with finite lives, are amortized over their respective lives to their estimated residual values and are also reviewed for impairment whenever certain triggering events may indicate impairment. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by discounting future cash flows. During fiscal 2018, we recorded asset impairment charges of $15.6 , primarily relating to the planned disposal of certain manufacturing facilities, and the write-off of machinery and equipment in excess of our needs due to our Global Integration Activities. The impairment charges are included in Restructuring costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were no impairments on long-lived assets in fiscal 2017. In conjunction with our analysis of our go-to-market strategy in Southeast Asia during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we evaluated future cash flows for this asset group and determined that the carrying value exceeded the undiscounted cash flows. As a result, we evaluated the fair value of the long-lived assets in the asset group, through an analysis of discounted future cash flows, and determined that the customer relationships were fully impaired and thus recorded $5.5 of Asset impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Business Combinations We allocate the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact our future operating results, as we recognize depreciation and amortization expense on long lived assets. We use a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisers for the values and lives of property, identifiable intangibles and inventories; and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations and liabilities associated with legal, environmental or other claims. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. The fair value estimates are based on historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to manage the acquired brands. Other intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment of intangible assets that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment. The costs of determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over the estimated useful life. We generally use the following methodologies for valuing our significant acquired intangibles assets: Trademarks (indefinite or finite) - We use a relief from royalty method to value trademarks. The key assumptions for the model are forecasted net revenue, the royalty rate, the effective tax rate and the discount rate. Customer relationships and license agreements - We use an excess earnings method to value customer relationships. The key assumptions for the model are forecasted net revenue and EBITDA, the estimated allocation of earnings between different classes of assets, the attrition rate, the effective tax rate and the discount rate. 59 Inventory Inventories include items which are considered salable or usable in future periods, and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being based on standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Costs include direct materials, direct labor and overhead (e.g., indirect labor, rent and utilities, depreciation, purchasing, receiving, inspection and quality control) and in-bound freight costs. We classify inventories into various categories based upon their stage in the product life cycle, future marketing sales plans and the disposition process. We also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the excess of the cost of the inventory over its estimated net realizable value, based on various product sales projections. This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends, and requirements to support forecasted sales. In addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events. These estimates could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the amounts that we may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels, product discontinuances, sales return levels, competitive conditions or other factors differ from our estimates and expectations. Pension Benefit Costs We sponsor both funded and unfunded pension plans in various forms covering employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements. We use several statistical and other factors in an attempt to estimate future events in calculating the liability and expense related to these plans. Certain significant variables require us to make assumptions such as anticipated discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension obligations. While we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges, an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a material impact on reported net income. The discount rates used to measure the benefit obligations at the measurement date and the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent fiscal year are reset annually using data available at the measurement date. The long-term rates of return on our pension plan assets are based on management expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the assets in which the plan is invested, as well as current economic and market conditions. The difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Those gains or losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods. In fiscal 2018 , our pension plans had actual returns on assets of $18.8 as compared with expected return on assets of $7.5 , which resulted in a net deferred gain of $11.3 , substantially all of which is currently subject to be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 9 to 29 years. The actual return on assets was primarily related to the performance of equity markets during the past fiscal year. The weighted-average assumptions used to determine our projected benefit obligation were as follows: Pension Plans U.S. International 2018 2017 2018 2017 Discount rates 4.0% 3.6% 0.6%-8.0% 0.4%-7.5% The weighted-average assumptions used to determine our net periodic benefit cost during the fiscal year were as follows: Pension Plans U.S. International 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 Discount rates 3.6% 3.3%-3.8% 4.1%-4.5% 0.4%-7.5% 0.2%-7.8% 1.0%-2.7% Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets N/A N/A 5.1% 1.8%-8.2% 1.6%-6.0% 2.3%-4.3% The actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions. Differences from these assumptions could significantly impact the actual amount of net periodic benefit cost and liability recorded by us. 60 Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes. Deferred taxes are recorded at currently enacted statutory tax rates and are adjusted as enacted tax rates change. In November 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to eliminate the requirement to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance sheet. The new standard requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent. We early adopted this guidance as of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 on a prospective basis beginning with the fiscal 2017 period presented. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as corresponding valuation allowances have been classified as noncurrent in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A valuation allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on currently available evidence. We consider how to recognize, measure, present and disclose in financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. We are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. We classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. For unrecognized tax benefits, we first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. As the determination of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, including associated interest and penalties, requires significant estimates to be made by us, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on our operating results or financial condition and cash flows. Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of examinations by tax authorities, developments in case law and closing of statute of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the provision for income taxes as appropriate. In addition, we are present in approximately 55 tax jurisdictions and we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act changing the U.S. to a modified territorial tax system, the Company no longer asserts that any of its undistributed foreign earnings are permanently reinvested. We do not expect to incur significant withholding or state taxes on future distributions. To the extent there remains a basis difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of an investment in a foreign subsidiary after the repatriation of the previously taxed income of $4,500.0 , the Company is permanently reinvested. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Interests held by third parties in consolidated majority-owned subsidiaries are presented as noncontrolling interests, which represents the noncontrolling stockholders interests in the underlying net assets of Coty consolidated majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interests, where we may be required to repurchase the noncontrolling interest under a put option or other contractual redemption requirement, are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets between liabilities and equity, as redeemable noncontrolling interests ( RNCI ). We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interests to the redemption values on each balance sheet date with changes recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings, or in the absence of retained earnings, as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. Younique We use an income approach, a market approach or a combination of these approaches to estimate the fair value of the RNCI related to our subsidiary Foundation, LLC, which holds a 100% interest in Younique, LLC. The income approach is used to determine the fair value of the Foundation RNCI using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of the business, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows. For the market approach, we use a selected multiple based on comparable companies multiplied by the forecasted cash flows. The key estimates and factors used in this approach include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and profit 61 margins based on our internal forecasts and the entity specific weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.
