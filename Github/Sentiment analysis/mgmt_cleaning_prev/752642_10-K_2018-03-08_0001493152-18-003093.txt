Overview The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and the historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The Company is a self-administered, self-managed, REIT with headquarters in Freehold, New Jersey. The Company primary business is the ownership and operation of manufactured home communities, which includes leasing manufactured home spaces on an annual or month-to-month basis to residential manufactured home owners. The Company also leases homes to residents and, through its taxable REIT subsidiary, S&F, sells and finances homes to residents and prospective residents of our communities. Our communities are located in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Indiana, Michigan and Maryland. UMH has continued to execute our growth strategy of purchasing well-located communities in our target markets, including the energy-rich Marcellus and Utica shale regions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased eleven manufactured home communities, for an aggregate purchase price of $63,290,000. These acquisitions added approximately 2,000 developed homesites to our portfolio, bringing our total to 112 communities containing approximately 20,000 developed homesites. - 31 - The Company earns income from the operation of its manufactured home communities, leasing of manufactured homesites, the rental of manufactured homes, the sale and finance of manufactured homes, the brokering of home sales, and from appreciation in the values of the manufactured home communities and vacant land owned by the Company. The Company also invests in securities of other REITs which the Company generally limits to no more than approximately 20% of its undepreciated assets. Occupancy in our properties, as well as our ability to increase rental rates, directly affects revenues. In 2017, total income increased 13.5% from the prior year and Community NOI (as defined below) increased 12.3% from the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition and rental programs in 2016 and 2017. Overall occupancy increased from 81.0% at December 31, 2016 to 81.4% at December 31, 2017. Same property occupancy, which includes communities owned and operated as of January 1, 2016, increased from 81.2% at December 31, 2016 to 82.7% at December 31, 2017. Overall occupancy includes communities acquired in 2017 at a weighted average occupancy of 67%. Sales of manufactured homes are getting stronger and have increased by approximately 27%. Our sales operations have been impacted by limited chattel financing options available in our industry. This has affected the ability of homebuyers to qualify for manufactured home loans. We are optimistic that future regulatory changes may increase our consumer ability to qualify for loans to purchase homes which should result in increased demand. Demand for housing remains healthy, due to improvements in the economy, sustained wage and job growth and favorable interest rates. Conventional single-family home prices continue their rise supported by low inventories and increasing sales. As household formation strengthens and for-sale inventory remains limited, a large share of housing demand will be looking at alternative forms of housing. Our property type offers substantial comparative value that should result in increased demand. The macro-economic environment and current housing fundamentals continue to favor home rentals. Rental homes in a manufactured home community allow the resident to obtain the efficiencies of factory-built housing and the amenities of community living for less than the cost of other forms of affordable housing. We continue to see increased demand for rental homes. During 2017, our portfolio of rental homes increased by 948 homes. Occupied rental homes represent approximately 32.2% of total occupied sites. Occupancy in rental homes continues to be strong and is at 93.0% as of December 31, 2017. We compare favorably with other types of rental housing, including apartments, and we will continue to allocate capital to rental home purchases, as demand dictates. Revenues also include interest and dividend income and realized gain on securities transactions, net. The Company holds a portfolio of marketable securities of other REITs with a fair value of $132,964,276 at December 31, 2017. The Company generally limits its marketable securities investments to no more than approximately 20% of its undepreciated assets. The REIT securities portfolio provides the Company with additional diversification, liquidity and income, and serves as a proxy for real estate when more favorable risk adjusted returns are not available. As of December 31, 2017, the Company portfolio consisted of 4% REIT preferred stocks and 96% REIT common stocks. The Company invests in these REIT securities and, from time to time, may use margin debt when an adequate yield spread can be obtained. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has borrowings of $37,157,467 under its margin line at 2.0% interest. The Company weighted average yield on the securities portfolio was approximately 7.4% at December 31, 2017. The Company realized a net gain of $1,747,528 on sale of securities in 2017 as compared to a net gain of $2,285,301 during 2016. At December 31, 2017, the Company had unrealized gains of $11,519,582 in its REIT securities portfolio. The dividends received from our securities investments continue to meet our expectations. It is our intent to hold these securities for investment on a long-term basis. The Company continues to strengthen its balance sheet. During 2017, the Company raised approximately $60.4 million in new capital through the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ( DRIP ). The Company also issued 1,400,000 shares of our common stock, raising net proceeds of $22.5 million, in conjunction with our inclusion in the MSCI REIT Index. This capital was used for general corporate purposes, which included purchase of manufactured homes for sale or lease to customers, expansion of its existing communities, acquisitions of additional properties, and repayment of indebtedness on a short-term basis. The Company also reduced its cost of capital in 2017 by issuing 5,750,000 shares of a new 6.75% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ( Series C Preferred Stock ) for net proceeds of $139.0 million, and redeeming all of the 3,663,800 outstanding shares of its 8.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ( Series A Preferred Stock ). This 150 basis point reduction will result in $1.4 million in annual preferred dividend savings going forward. Subsequent to yearend, UMH issued and sold 2,000,000 shares of a new 6.375% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (Series D Preferred Stock), raising net proceeds from the offering after expenses of approximately $48.1 million. - 32 - At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $23.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $15 million available on our credit facility, with an additional $75 million potentially available pursuant to an accordion feature. We also had $26.3 million available on our revolving lines of credit for the financing of home sales and the purchase of inventory. In addition, we held approximately $133.0 million in marketable REIT securities encumbered by $37.2 million in margin loans. In general, the Company may borrow up to 50% of the value of the marketable securities. The Company intends to continue to increase its real estate investments. Our business plan includes acquiring communities that yield in excess of our cost of funds and then making physical improvements, including adding rental homes onto otherwise vacant sites. In 2016 and 2017, we have added a total of fourteen manufactured home communities to our portfolio, encompassing approximately 2,300 developed sites. These manufactured home communities were acquired with an average occupancy rate of 68%. The Company will utilize the rental home program to increase occupancy rates and improve operating results at these communities. There is no guarantee that any additional opportunities will materialize or that the Company will be able to take advantage of such opportunities. The growth of our real estate portfolio depends on the availability of suitable properties which meet the Company investment criteria and appropriate financing. Competition in the market areas in which the Company operates is significant and affects acquisitions, occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of certain properties. See PART I, Item 1- Business and Item 1A Risk Factors for a more complete discussion of the economic and industry-wide factors relevant to the Company, the Company lines of business and principal products and services, and the opportunities, challenges and risks on which the Company is focused.

These non-GAAP financial measures as determined and presented by us may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies, and include Community Net Operating Income ( Community NOI ), Funds from Operations ( FFO ), Core Funds from Operations ( Core FFO ) and Normalized Funds from Operations ( Normalized FFO ). We define Community NOI as rental and related income less community operating expenses such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, community salaries, utilities, insurance and other expenses. We believe that Community NOI is helpful to investors and analysts as a direct measure of the actual operating results of our manufactured home communities, rather than our Company overall. Community NOI should not be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Community NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of our financial performance, or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity; nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. The Company Community NOI is calculated as follows: 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Rental and Related Income $ 101,801,425 $ 90,679,557 $ 74,762,548 $ 63,886,010 $ 53,477,893 Community Operating Expenses (47,846,565 ) (42,638,333 ) (37,049,462 ) (33,592,327 ) (29,140,920 ) Community NOI $ 53,954,860 $ 48,041,224 $ 37,713,086 $ 30,293,683 $ 24,336,973 We also assess and measure our overall operating results based upon an industry performance measure referred to as FFO, which management believes is a useful indicator of our operating performance. FFO is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of a REIT. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, as defined by GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined under GAAP, gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization. NAREIT created FFO as a non-GAAP supplemental measure of REIT operating performance. We define Core FFO as FFO plus acquisition costs and costs of early extinguishment of debt. We define Normalized FFO as Core FFO excluding gains and losses realized on securities investments and certain non-recurring charges. FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO should be considered as supplemental measures of operating performance used by REITs. FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO exclude historical cost depreciation as an expense and may facilitate the comparison of REITs which have a different cost basis. The items excluded from FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO are significant components in understanding the Company financial performance. FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO (i) do not represent Cash Flow from Operations as defined by GAAP; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii) are not alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs. - 34 - The Company FFO, Core FFO and Normalized FFO are calculated as follows: 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders $ (7,679,265 ) $ (2,568,873 ) $ (6,122,993 ) $ (3,318,785 ) $ (1,719,765 ) Depreciation Expense 27,557,746 23,214,100 18,877,511 15,163,420 11,681,724 (Gain) Loss on Sales of Depreciable Assets 80,930 2,163 80,268 (7,313 ) (18,803 ) FFO 19,959,411 20,647,390 12,834,786 11,837,322 9,943,156 Adjustments: Acquisition Costs -0- 79,231 957,219 483,522 1,455,542 Early Extinguishment of Debt (1) -0- 5,121 475,031 -0- -0- Redemption of Preferred Stock 3,502,487 -0- -0- -0- -0- Core FFO 23,461,898 20,731,742 14,267,036 12,320,844 11,398,698 Adjustments: Gain on Sales of Securities, net (1,747,528 ) (2,285,301 ) (204,230 ) (1,542,589 ) (4,055,812 ) Settlement of Memphis Mobile City Litigation (2) -0- -0- 125,000 -0- -0- Normalized FFO $ 21,714,370 $ 18,446,441 $ 14,187,806 $ 10,778,255 $ 7,342,886 (1) Included in Interest Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). (2) Included in Community Operating Expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). Results of Operations 2017 vs. 2016 Rental and related income increased from $90,679,557 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $101,801,425 for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 12%. This increase was due to the acquisitions during 2016 and 2017, as well as an increase in rental rates, same property occupancy and additional rental homes. During 2017, the Company raised rental rates by 3% to 4% at most communities. Rent increases vary depending on overall market conditions and demand. Occupancy, as well as the ability to increase rental rates, directly affects revenues. The Company has been acquiring communities with vacant sites that can potentially be occupied and earn income in the future. Overall occupancy has increased from 81.0% at December 31, 2016 to 81.4% at December 31, 2017. Overall occupancy includes communities acquired in 2017 and 2016, which had a weighted average occupancy of 67% and 74%, respectively, at the time of acquisition. Same property occupancy has increased from 81.2% at December 31, 2016 to 82.7% at December 31, 2017. The overall and same property occupancy rates is exclusive of the sites at Memphis Blues, which is under redevelopment due to a flood in 2011. Demand for rental homes continues to be strong. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 5,600 rental homes with an occupancy of 93.0%. We continue to evaluate the demand for rental homes and will invest in additional homes as demand dictates. Vacant sites allow for future revenue growth. Community operating expenses increased from $42,638,333 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $47,846,565 for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 12%. This increase was due to the acquisitions during 2016 and 2017. Community NOI increased from $48,041,224 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $53,954,860 for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 12%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions during 2016 and 2017 and an increase in rental rates, occupancy and rental homes. The Operating Expense Ratio (defined as Community Operating Expenses divided by Rental and Related Income) was 47.0% for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Many acquisitions have deferred maintenance requiring higher than normal expenditures in the first few years of ownership. Because most of the community expenses are fixed costs, as occupancy rates continue to increase, these expense ratios will continue to improve. Because of the Company ability to increase its rental rates annually, increasing costs due to inflation and changing prices have generally not had a material effect on revenues and income from continuing operations. - 35 - Sales of manufactured homes increased from $8,534,272 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $10,846,494 for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 27%. The total number of homes sold was 222 homes in 2017 as compared to 170 homes in 2016. There were 74 new homes sold in 2017 as compared to 61 in 2016. The Company average sales price was $48,858 and $50,202 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cost of sales of manufactured homes increased from $6,466,520 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $8,471,190 for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 31%. The gross profit percentage was 22% and 24% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Selling expenses remained relatively stable at $3,095,155 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $2,852,405 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Loss from the sales operations (defined as sales of manufactured homes less cost of sales of manufactured homes less selling expenses less interest on the financing of inventory) decreased from $1,444,076 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $1,147,501 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an improvement of 21%. The losses on sales include selling expenses of approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Many of these costs, such as rent, salaries, and to an extent, advertising and promotion, are fixed. Sales of manufactured homes have not yet returned to pre-recession levels. The U.S. homeownership rate was 64.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017, according to the U.S. Census. This is down from 69.2% at its peak at the end of 2004. The conventional single-family housing market has strengthened and conventional home prices continue their rise. The inherent affordability of our property type becomes more and more apparent which should result in increased demand. The Company continues to be optimistic about future sales and rental prospects given the fundamental need for affordable housing. The Company believes that sales of new homes produces new rental revenue and is an investment in the upgrading of our communities. General and Administrative Expenses increased from $8,004,925 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $9,645,681 for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 21%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel and personnel costs, as headcount increased in connection with the Company's growth, and an increase in non-cash stock compensation expense. Stock compensation expense increased from $1,064,678 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $1,314,491 for the year ended December 31, 2017. These increases were primarily due to the increase in our stock price during the year, which increased the fair value of options granted. The weighted-average fair value of options granted increased from $0.81 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $1.81 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, the Founder and Chairman of the Board was granted a discretionary stock option award of 100,000 shares, as well as 1,100 shares of restricted stock. Although these awards are usually recognized over the vesting period, the entire compensation cost of approximately $201,000 was recognized at the time of grant since he is of retirement age. General and Administrative expenses as a percentage of gross revenue (Total Income plus Interest, Dividend and Other Income) remains in line at 7.8% and 7.4% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Acquisition Costs amounted to $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $79,231 for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2017-01 Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business prospectively as of January 1, 2017, we account for our property acquisitions as acquisitions of assets and no longer account for our property acquisitions as business combinations. In an acquisition of assets, certain acquisition costs are capitalized to real estate investments as part of the purchase price as opposed to being expensed as Acquisition Costs under the previous accounting treatment for business combinations. Depreciation expense increased from $23,214,100 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $27,557,746 for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 19%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions and the increase in rental homes during 2016 and 2017. Interest income increased from $1,584,585 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $2,006,880 for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 27%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of notes receivable from $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Dividend income increased from $6,636,126 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $8,134,898 for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 23%. This increase was due to an increase in the average balance of securities from $91.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $120.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The dividends received from our securities investments were at a weighted average yield of 7.4% and 6.8% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. - 36 - Realized gain on sales of securities, net consists of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Gross realized gains $ 1,749,034 $ 2,287,454 Gross realized losses (1,506 ) (2,153 ) Total Gain on Securities Transactions, net $ 1,747,528 $ 2,285,301 The Company had an accumulated net unrealized gain on its securities portfolio of $11,519,582 as of December 31, 2017. Other income increased from $504,759 at December 31, 2016 to $705,048 at December 31, 2017. The increase is mainly due to an upfront oil and gas bonus payment of $251,680 that the Company received at one of its communities. Interest expense remained relatively stable for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year, we obtained 3 new mortgage loans, and assumed 1 loan in conjunction with an acquisition, totaling $47 million. The average balance of mortgages payable was approximately $299 million during 2017 as compared to approximately $288 million during 2016. The weighted average interest rate on its mortgages, not including the effect of unamortized debt issuance costs, was 4.2% at December 31, 2017 as compared to 4.3% at December 31, 2016. 2016 vs. 2015 Rental and related income increased from $74,762,548 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $90,679,557 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 21%. This increase was due to the acquisitions during 2015 and 2016, as well as an increase in rental rates, same property occupancy and additional rental homes. During 2016, the Company raised rental rates by 3% to 5% at most communities. Rent increases vary depending on overall market conditions and demand. Occupancy, as well as the ability to increase rental rates, directly affects revenues. The Company has been acquiring communities with vacant sites that can potentially be occupied and earn income in the future. Occupancy has increased from 79.5% at December 31, 2015 to 81.0% at December 31, 2016. The overall occupancy rate is exclusive of 156 vacant sites at Memphis Blues caused by the 2011 flood. Same property occupancy has increased from 82.9% at December 31, 2015 to 84.8% at December 31, 2016. Demand for rental homes continues to be strong. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 4,700 rental homes with an occupancy of 91.5%. We continue to evaluate the demand for rental homes and will invest in additional homes as demand dictates. Vacant sites allow for future revenue growth. Community operating expenses increased from $37,049,462 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $42,638,333 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 15%. This increase was due to the acquisitions during 2015 and 2016. Community NOI increased from $37,713,086 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $48,041,224 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 27%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions during 2015 and 2016 and an increase in rental rates, occupancy and rental homes. The Company has also been reducing its Operating Expense Ratio (defined as Community Operating Expenses divided by Rental and Related Income). The Operating Expense Ratio decreased from 49.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 47.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 260 basis points. Many acquisitions have deferred maintenance requiring higher than normal expenditures in the first two years of ownership. Because most of the community expenses are fixed costs, as occupancy rates continue to increase, these expense ratios will continue to improve. Because of the Company ability to increase its rental rates annually, increasing costs due to inflation and changing prices have generally not had a material effect on revenues and income from continuing operations. - 37 - Sales of manufactured homes increased from $6,754,123 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $8,534,272 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 26%. The total number of homes sold was 170 homes in 2016 as compared to 135 homes in 2015. There were 61 new homes sold in 2016 as compared to 65 in 2015. The Company average sales price was $50,202 and $50,031 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cost of sales of manufactured homes increased from $5,058,350 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $6,466,520 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 28%. The gross profit percentage was 24% and 25% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Selling expenses remained relatively stable at $2,852,405 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $2,788,360 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Loss from the sales operations (defined as sales of manufactured homes less cost of sales of manufactured homes less selling expenses less interest on the financing of inventory) decreased from $1,851,780 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1,444,076 for the year ended December 31, 2016, an improvement of 22%. The losses on sales include selling expenses of approximately $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Many of these costs, such as rent, salaries, and to an extent, advertising and promotion, are fixed. Sales of manufactured homes have not yet returned to pre-recession levels. The U.S. homeownership rate fell to 63.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to the U.S. Census. This is down from 69.2% at its peak at the end of 2004. The conventional single-family housing market is gradually strengthening. However, our sales continue to be negatively impacted as a result of the inability of our customers to sell their current homes, limited wage growth, new licensing laws and government regulations. The Company continues to be optimistic about future sales and rental prospects given the fundamental need for affordable housing. The Company believes that sales of new homes produces new rental revenue and is an investment in the upgrading of our communities. General and Administrative Expenses increased from $7,345,644 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $8,004,925 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 9%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel and personnel costs and the issuance of restricted stock and stock options to one employee of retirement age. The entire compensation cost of $312,400 for this employee was recognized at the time of grant. General and Administrative expenses as a percentage of gross revenue (Total Income plus Interest, Dividend and Other Income) improved from 8.3% in 2015 to 7.4% in 2016. Acquisition costs, relating to the transaction, due diligence and other related costs associated with the acquisitions of communities, decreased from $957,219 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $79,231 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 92%. This decrease was due to the decrease in acquisitions in 2016 with an aggregate purchase price of $7,277,000 as compared to 2015 with an aggregate purchase price of $81,217,000. Depreciation expense increased from $18,877,511 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $23,214,100 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 23%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions and the increase in rental homes during 2015 and 2016. Interest income decreased from $1,819,567 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1,584,585 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 13%. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of notes receivable from $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Dividend income increased from $4,399,181 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $6,636,126 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 51%. This increase was due to an increase in the average balance of securities from $69,283,611 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $91,883,216 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The dividends received from our securities investments were at a weighted average yield of 6.8% and 7.7% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. - 38 - Realized gain on sales of securities, net consists of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Gross realized gains $ 2,287,454 $ 208,200 Gross realized losses (2,153 ) (3,970 ) Total Realized Gain on Sales of Securities, net $ 2,285,301 $ 204,230 The Company had an accumulated net unrealized gain on its securities portfolio of $16,717,171 as of December 31, 2016. Other income remained relatively stable for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense increased from $14,074,446 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $15,432,364 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or 10%. This increase was primarily due to the new mortgage loans for the community acquisitions as well as additional community financings/refinancings in 2016. During the year, we obtained 4 new mortgage loans totaling $32 million. The average balance of mortgages payable was approximately $288 million during 2016 as compared to approximately $235 million during 2015. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by the decrease in the weighted average interest rate on its mortgages which was 4.3%, not including the effect of unamortized debt issuance costs, at December 31, 2016 as compared to 4.5% at December 31, 2015. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company operates as a REIT deriving its income primarily from real estate rental operations. The Company principal liquidity demands have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, payments of expenses relating to real estate operations, acquisitions, capital improvements, development and expansions of properties, debt service, purchases of manufactured homes, investment in debt and equity securities of other REITs, financing of manufactured home sales and distribution requirements. The Company ability to generate cash adequate to meet these demands is dependent primarily on income from its real estate investments and securities portfolio, the sale of real estate investments and securities, financing and refinancing of mortgage debt, leveraging of real estate investments, availability of bank borrowings, proceeds from the DRIP, and access to the capital markets. The Company intends to operate its existing properties from the cash flows generated by the properties. However, the Company expenses are affected by various factors, including inflation. Increases in operating expenses raise the breakeven point for a property and, to the extent that they cannot be passed on through higher rents, reduce the amount of available cash flow which can adversely affect the market value of the property. The Company continues to strengthen its capital and liquidity positions. The Company has a DRIP in which participants can purchase stock from the Company at a price of approximately 95% of market. During 2017, amounts received, including dividends reinvested of $2.9 million, totaled $60.4 million. The Company also issued 1,400,000 shares of its common stock in a registered direct placement, raising net proceeds of $22.5 million and 5,750,000 shares of its Series C Preferred Stock in an underwritten registered public offering, raising net proceeds of approximately $139 million. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock were primarily used to redeem all of the 3,663,800 outstanding shares of the Company Series A Preferred Stock. This 150 basis point reduction will result in $1.4 million in annual preferred dividend savings going forward. Subsequent to yearend, UMH issued and sold 2,000,000 shares of a new Series D Preferred Stock, raising net proceeds of approximately $48.1 million. On March 28, 2017, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement to renew and expand its existing unsecured revolving credit facility. The new facility provides for an increase from $35 million in available borrowings to $50 million in available borrowings with a $75 million accordion feature, bringing the total potential availability up to $125 million, subject to certain conditions. As of December 31, 2017, $15 million was available on this credit facility. Subsequent to yearend, UMH repaid $20 million of the facility, resulting in an availability of $35 million, with an additional $75 million potentially available pursuant to an accordion feature. - 39 - The Company has the ability to finance home sales, inventory purchases and rental home purchases. The Company has a $10 million revolving line of credit for the financing of homes, of which $4 million was utilized at December 31, 2017, and revolving credit facilities totaling $28.5 million to finance inventory purchases, of which $2.2 million was utilized at December 31, 2017. During 2017, the Company closed on three mortgage loans with gross proceeds of $44.4 million. These loans have a weighted average interest rate of 4.28%, a weighted average maturity of 10 years and were secured by 9 communities. We also paid off three maturing mortgage loans of approximately $27.8 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.55%, secured by 17 communities. In conjunction with an acquisition, the Company also assumed a $2.4 million 6.35% mortgage loan which matures on February 1, 2023. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $23.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale of $133.0 million encumbered by $37.2 million in margin loans. The Company owns 112 communities of which 43 are unencumbered. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had one mortgage due in 2018, which was paid off subsequent to yearend. The Company marketable securities and non-mortgaged properties provide us with additional liquidity. The Company believes that cash on hand, funds generated from operations, the DRIP and capital market, the funds available on the lines of credit, together with the ability to finance and refinance its properties will provide sufficient funds to adequately meet its obligations over the next several years. The Company focus is on real estate investments. The Company has historically financed purchases of real estate primarily through mortgages. During 2017, total investment property increased 19% or $124.2 million. The Company made acquisitions of eleven manufactured home communities totaling approximately 2,000 developed sites at an aggregate purchase price of $63.3 million. These acquisitions were funded through new mortgages, the use of our unsecured credit facility and the issuance of preferred stock. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our acquisitions and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for related debt transactions. The Company continues to evaluate acquisition opportunities. The funds for these acquisitions may come from bank borrowings, proceeds from the DRIP, and private placements or public offerings of common or preferred stock. To the extent that funds or appropriate properties are not available, fewer acquisitions will be made. The Company also invests in rental homes and as of December 31, 2017 the Company owns approximately 5,600 rental homes, or approximately 28% of our total homesites. During 2017, our rental home portfolio increased by 948 homes or $44.1 million. The Company markets these rental homes for sale to existing residents. The Company estimates that in 2018 it will purchase approximately 800 manufactured homes to use as rental units for a total cost, including setup, of approximately $32 million. Rental home rates on new homes range from $700-$1,200 per month, including lot rent, depending on size, location and market conditions. During 2017, the Company also invested approximately $18 million in other improvements to our communities. Additionally, the Company invests in marketable debt and equity securities of other REITs. The REIT securities portfolio provides the Company with additional liquidity and income and serves as a proxy for real estate when more favorable risk adjusted returns are not available. The Company generally limits its marketable securities investments to no more than approximately 20% of its undepreciated assets. During 2017, the securities portfolio increased 22% or $24.2 million primarily due to purchases of $45.1 million, partially offset by sales of securities with a cost of $15.7 million and a decrease in the net unrealized gain of $5.2 million. The Company recognized gains on sales of securities of $1.7 million in addition to the dividend income earned of $8.1 million. The Company from time to time may purchase these securities on margin when there is an adequate yield spread. At December 31, 2017, $37.2 million was outstanding on the margin loan at a 2.0% interest rate. - 40 - The following table summarizes cash flow activity for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: 2017 2016 2015 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 41,341,162 $ 29,353,412 $ 25,708,212 Net Cash Used by Investing Activities (152,919,761 ) (77,567,390 ) (148,674,626 ) Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 130,604,097 45,894,673 121,419,519 Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 19,025,498 $ (2,319,305 ) $ (1,546,895 ) Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $12.0 million and $3.6 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The overall increases were primarily due to the increases in income from operations generated from acquisitions and increased rental homes. Net cash used by investing activities increased by $75.4 million in 2017 primarily due to an increase in acquisitions of manufactured home communities and an increase in our REIT securities portfolio. Net cash used by investing activities decreased by $71.1 million in 2016 primarily due to a decrease in acquisitions of manufactured home communities. Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $84.7 million in 2017 to $130.6 million. The Company received $60.4 million, including dividends reinvested, through the DRIP, issued 1,400,000 shares of its common stock in a registered direct placement, raising net proceeds of $22.5 million, and issued 5,750,000 shares of its Series C Preferred Stock in an underwritten registered public offering, raising net proceeds of approximately $139 million. $91.6 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock was used to redeem all of the 3,663,800 outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock. During 2017, the Company also distributed to our common shareholders a total of $23.6 million, including dividends reinvested. It is anticipated, although no assurances can be given, that the level of participation in the DRIP in 2018 will be comparable to 2017. In addition, the Company also paid $16.7 million in preferred dividends. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $75.5 million in 2016 to $45.9 million primarily due to the financing/refinancing of 4 communities for $32 million in 2016 as compared to 21 communities for $139 million in 2015. Cash flows were primarily used for purchases of manufactured home communities, capital improvements, payment of dividends, purchases of securities available for sale, purchase of inventory and rental homes, loans to customers for the sales of manufactured homes, and expansion of existing communities. The Company meets maturing mortgage obligations by using a combination of cash flow and refinancing. The dividend payments were primarily made from cash flow from operations. Cash flows used for capital improvements include amounts needed to meet environmental and regulatory requirements in connection with the manufactured home communities that provide water or sewer service. Excluding expansions and rental home purchases, the Company is budgeting approximately $10 million in capital improvements for 2018. The Company significant commitments and contractual obligations relate to its mortgages and loans payable, acquisitions of manufactured home communities, retirement benefits, and the lease on its corporate offices as described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has 1,500 acres of undeveloped land which it could develop over the next several years. The Company continues to analyze the best use of its vacant land. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had total assets of $823.9 million and total liabilities of $402.7 million. The Company believes that it has the ability to meet its obligations and to generate funds for new investments. - 41 - Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The Company has not executed any material off-balance sheet arrangements. The following is a summary of the Company contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017: Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Mortgages Payable $ 308,460,786 $ 6,744,175 $ 26,971,684 $ 34,268,639 $ 240,476,288 Interest on Mortgages Payable 83,015,560 13,127,126 24,582,494 21,895,995 23,409,945 Loans Payable 84,765,824 2,776,329 44,033,478 656,348 37,299,669 Interest on Loans Payable 9,841,734 2,602,684 4,613,783 1,760,062 865,205 Operating Lease Obligations 945,440 214,800 435,280 295,360 -0- Retirement Benefits 450,000 -0- -0- -0- 450,000 Total $ 487,479,344 $ 25,965,114 $ 100,636,719 $ 58,876,404 $ 302,501,107 Mortgages payable represents the principal amounts outstanding based on scheduled payments. The interest rates on these mortgages vary from fixed rates ranging from 3.71% to 6.5% and a variable rate of Prime plus 1.0%. The weighted average interest rate, not including the effect of unamortized debt issuance costs, was approximately 4.2% at December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted average loan maturity of the mortgage payable is 6.9 years. Loans payable represents $35,000,000 outstanding on the Company unsecured line of credit with an interest rate ranging from LIBOR plus 1.75% to 2.50% or Prime plus 0.75% to 1.50%, based on the Company overall leverage (interest rate of 3.36% as of December 31, 2017); $37,157,467 outstanding on its margin line with an interest rate of 2.0% at December 31, 2017; $2,239,315 outstanding on the Company revolving credit agreements to finance inventory with interest rates ranging from prime with a minimum of 6% to Prime plus 2% with a minimum of 8% after 18 months (weighted average interest rate of 6.74% as of December 31, 2017); $421,930 loans outstanding for the finance of rental homes with an interest rate of 6.99% at December 31, 2017; $3,969,329 outstanding on its commercial term loan with an interest rate of 4.625% at December 31, 2017; $4,000,000 outstanding on the Company revolving line of credit secured by eligible notes receivables with an interest rate of prime plus 50 basis points (interest rate of 4.75% as of December 31, 2017); and $1,977,783 outstanding on its automotive loans with a weighted average interest rate of 4.05%. Operating lease obligations represent a lease with a related party for the Company corporate offices. On May 1, 2015, the Company renewed this lease for additional space and for an additional seven-year term with monthly lease payments of $14,900 through April 30, 2020 and $15,300 through April 30, 2022. On July 1, 2017, the Company entered into a lease for additional office space adjacent to its existing corporate office space requiring monthly lease payments of $1,275 through April 30, 2020 and $1,310 through April 30, 2022. On February 14, 2018, the Company entered into a lease for additional office space adjacent to its existing corporate office space requiring monthly lease payments of $1,800 through April 30, 2020 and $1,850 through April 30, 2022. The Company is also responsible for its proportionate share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance. Mr. Eugene W. Landy, the Founder and Chairman of the Board of the Company, owns a 24% interest in the entity that is the landlord of the property where the Company corporate office space is located. Management believes that the aforesaid rent is no more than what the Company would pay for comparable space elsewhere. Retirement benefits of $450,000 represent the total future amount to be paid, on an undiscounted basis, relating to the Company Founder and Chairman. These benefits are based upon his specific employment agreement. The agreement does not require the Company to separately fund the obligation and therefore will be paid from the general assets of the Company. The Company has accrued these benefits on a present value basis over the term of the agreement (See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). - 42 - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of the Company financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Significant accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgment and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements. For a detailed description of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. Real Estate Investments The Company applies Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 360-10, Property, Plant & Equipment ( ASC 360-10 ) to measure impairment in real estate investments. Rental properties are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash flows (on an undiscounted basis without interest) from a rental property is less than the carrying value under its historical net cost basis. These expected future cash flows consider factors such as future operating income, trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. Upon determination that a permanent impairment has occurred, rental properties are reduced to their fair value. For properties to be disposed of, an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the property, less the estimated cost to sell, is less than the carrying amount of the property measured at the time there is a commitment to sell the property and/or it is actively being marketed for sale. A property to be disposed of is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value, less its cost to sell. Subsequent to the date that a property is held for disposition, depreciation expense is not recorded. Upon acquisition of a property, the Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805 ) and allocates the purchase price of the property based upon the fair value of the assets acquired, which generally consist of land, site and land improvements, buildings and improvements and rental homes. The Company allocates the purchase price of an acquired property generally determined by internal evaluation as well as third-party appraisal of the property obtained in conjunction with the purchase. In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Clarifying the Definition of a Business . ASU 2017-01 seeks to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, intangible assets and consolidation. The adoption of ASU 2017-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. The amendments should be applied prospectively on or after the effective dates. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2017, on a prospective basis. The Company evaluated its acquisitions and has determined that its acquisitions of manufactured home communities during 2017 should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets. As such, transaction costs, such as broker fees, transfer taxes, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional and consulting fees, related to acquisitions are capitalized as part of the cost of the acquisitions, which is then subject to a purchase price allocation based on relative fair value. The Company conducted a comprehensive review of all real estate asset classes in accordance with ASC 360-10-35-21, which indicates that asset values should be analyzed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. The process entailed the analysis of property for instances where the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value. In accordance with ASC 360-10-35-17, an impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The Company utilizes the experience and knowledge of its internal valuation team to derive certain assumptions used to determine an operating property cash flow. Such assumptions include lease-up rates, rental rates, rental growth rates, and capital expenditures. The Company reviewed its operating properties in light of the requirements of ASC 360-10 and determined that, as of December 31, 2017, the undiscounted cash flows over the holding period for these properties were in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, no impairment charges were required. - 43 - Securities Available for Sale Investments in non-real estate assets consist primarily of marketable securities. The Company individually reviews and evaluates our marketable securities for impairment on a quarterly basis or when events or circumstances that may indicate possible impairment occur. The Company considers, among other things, credit aspects of the issuer, amount of decline in fair value over cost and length of time in a continuous loss position. The Company has developed a general policy of evaluating whether an unrealized loss is other than temporary. On a quarterly basis, the Company makes an initial review of every individual security in its portfolio. If the security is impaired, the Company first determines our intent and ability to hold this investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Next, the Company determines the length of time and the extent of the impairment. Barring other factors, including the downgrading of the security or the cessation of dividends, if the fair value of the security is below cost by less than 20% for less than 6 months and the Company has the intent and ability to hold the security, the security is deemed to not be other than temporarily impaired. Otherwise, the Company reviews additional information to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary. The Company discusses and analyzes any relevant information known about the security, such as: a. Whether the decline is attributable to adverse conditions related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or in a geographic area. b. Any downgrading of the security by a rating agency. c. Whether the financial condition of the issuer has deteriorated. d. Status of dividends Whether dividends have been reduced or eliminated, or scheduled interest payments have not been made. e. Analysis of the underlying assets (including NAV analysis) using independent analysis or recent transactions. The Company generally holds REIT securities long-term and has the ability and intent to hold securities to recovery. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized in earnings and the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value as the new cost basis. The Company securities consist primarily of common and preferred stock of other REITs. These securities are all publicly-traded and purchased on the open market, through private transactions or through dividend reinvestment plans. These securities are classified among three categories: Held-to-maturity, trading and available-for-sale. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company securities are all classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Gains or losses on the sale of securities are based on average cost and are accounted for on a trade date basis. Unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of Shareholders Equity until realized. The change in net unrealized holding gains and losses are reflected as comprehensive income (loss). On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . Upon adoption of ASU 2016-01, the Company anticipates that these securities will continue to be measured at fair value; however, the change in the unrealized net holding gains and losses will be recognized through net income. Other Estimates are used when accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts for our rents and loans receivable, potentially excess and obsolete inventory and contingent liabilities, among others. These estimates are susceptible to change and actual results could differ from these estimates. The effects of changes in these estimates are recognized in the period they are determined.
