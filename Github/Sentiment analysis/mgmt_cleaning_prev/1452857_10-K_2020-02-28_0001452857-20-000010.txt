Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto that are available elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following is a discussion and analysis of SPLP's consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 . In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A. , Risk Factors . All monetary amounts used in this discussion are in thousands except common and preferred unit and per common and preferred unit amounts. Business Segments SPLP operates through the following segments: Diversified Industrial, Energy, Financial Services, and Corporate and Other, which are managed separately and offer different products and services. For a more complete description of the Company's segments, see Part I, Item 1. , " Business - Products and Product Mix" found elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Recent Developments Following is a summary of recent developments that have impacted the Company in 2019 and early 2020 . For additional discussion of these matters, please see the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8. , Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Report. On February 6, 2020 ("Redemption Date"), the Company redeemed 1,600,000 preferred units at a price equal to $25 per unit, plus an amount of $0.22 per unit, equal to any accumulated and unpaid distributions up to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, for a total payment of approximately $40,400 . On January 31, 2020, the Company announced that API Group Limited and certain of its affiliates commenced administration proceedings in the United Kingdom. The purpose of the administration proceedings is to facilitate an orderly sale or wind-down of its United Kingdom operations. In the United States, API Americas Inc. voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 proceedings in Bankruptcy Court on February 2, 2020 in order to facilitate the sale or liquidation of its assets. The API entities are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company and are included in the Diversified Industrial segment. The Company will deconsolidate the API entities on the previously noted filing dates as it no longer holds a controlling financial interest as of those dates. During the three months ended December 31, 2019 , as a result of declines in market conditions and customer demand at API, the Company determined that the carrying value of API's long-lived assets, primarily machinery and equipment and buildings, exceeded their estimated market value by $ 26,514 . Also, as described in Note 9 - " Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net ," found elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the Company fully impaired API's intangible assets of $3,078 . The Company recorded these impairments in Asset Impairment Charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations, found elsewhere 22 in this Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2019 . Further declines in market conditions, customer demand or other potential changes in operations at API in future periods may increase the risk that API's remaining long-lived assets, totaling approximately $12,053 in aggregate as of December 31, 2019 , may not be recoverable and may potentially be impaired. Refer to Note 26 - " Subsequent Events ," found elsewhere in this Form 10-K, for further discussion of API. As a result of declines in customer demand and the performance of the packaging business, which includes the operations of API and Dunmore and is included in the Diversified Industrial segment, the Company fully impaired the packaging business' goodwill and recorded a $41,853 charge in Goodwill impairment charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, found elsewhere in this Form 10-K, during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2019. During the second quarter of 2019, the Company became aware of a misstatement related to its January 2015 sale of Arlon, LLC, whereby the tax basis of Arlon, LLC at the time of sale was calculated incorrectly. The misstatement was discovered in connection with an IRS examination of the Company's 2015 income tax filing. The accompanying consolidated statements of changes in capital found elsewhere in this Form 10-K have been adjusted to decrease the opening balance of Partners' capital as of December 31, 2017 by approximately $26,864 , with a corresponding increase to Accrued liabilities at December 31, 2018. The estimated liability of $26,864 is made up of federal tax and interest of $24,002 , and state tax and interest of $2,862 . The IRS audit was expanded to include 2016 and 2017, and all years were subsequently agreed and settled for federal tax purposes in late 2019. The Company settled the federal portion of the IRS audit for $21,782 in the fourth quarter of 2019, and recorded a benefit of $2,220 in Income tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations, found elsewhere in this Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2019 . Refer to Note 17 - " Income Taxes ," found elsewhere in this Form 10-K, for further detail. On July 9, 2019, the Company entered into a settlement of a stockholder class action, captioned Sciabacucchi v. DeMarco, et al. In the settlement, the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiff class $30,000, but denied that they engaged in any wrongdoing or committed any violation of law or breach of duty and stated that they believe they acted properly, in good faith, and in a manner consistent with their legal duties. The settlement was approved by the court on December 2, 2019. Our insurance carriers agreed to contribute an aggregate of $17,500 toward the settlement amount. The Company recorded a charge of $12,500 in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, found elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which consisted of the legal settlement of $30,000, reduced by $17,500 of insurance recoveries. The settlement was paid on December 17, 2019. The Company made a demand of an aggregate of $10,000 in further contributions from two insurance carriers, which the carriers declined, and we are pursuing claims in court to endeavor to recover this sum, although there can be no assurance as to the outcome of this litigation. On April 1, 2019, the Company, through its subsidiary, WebBank, completed the acquisition of National Partners for consideration of $47,725 , which includes assumed debt, including debt with a third-party that WebBank had a preexisting $10,000 participation, and is subject to a potential $1,800 earn-out based on future performance through June 30, 2020, as provided in the purchase agreement. National Partners provides commercial premium finance solutions for national insurance brokerages, independent insurance agencies and insureds in key markets throughout the United States. On January 31, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to its senior credit facility to allow the Company to (i) convert $200,000 of the revolving credit commitments into a term loan with quarterly amortization equating to 5.0% per annum, (ii) amend certain defined leverage ratios under the credit agreement, increasing allowable leverage by 0.25 "turns" on a permanent basis through the maturity of the credit agreement, (iii) eliminate certain previously allowed investments, which would have reduced collateral available to the Company's lenders and (iv) make certain administrative changes. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company purchased 505,336 units, for an aggregate price of approximately $6,721 under the Repurchase Program. The Company has purchased 2,089,177 common units for an aggregate price of approximately $33,881 under the Repurchase Program, and there remain 910,823 units that may yet be purchased under the Repurchase Program. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 23 Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Revenue $ 1,561,771 $ 1,584,614 Cost of goods sold 1,052,241 1,109,978 Selling, general and administrative expenses 356,803 352,794 Goodwill impairment charges 41,853 Asset impairment charges 30,506 8,108 Interest expense 41,409 39,234 Realized and unrealized (gains) losses on securities, net (47,315 ) 62,586 All other expenses, net 58,513 21,336 Total costs and expenses 1,534,010 1,594,036 Income (loss) before income taxes and equity method investments 27,761 (9,422 ) Income tax provision 15,865 12,559 Loss of associated companies, net of taxes 8,043 9,509 Net income (loss) 3,853 (31,490 ) Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 97 (1,114 ) Net income (loss) attributable to common unitholders $ 3,950 $ (32,604 ) Revenue Revenue in 2019 decreased $22,843 , or 1.4% , as compared to 2018 . Excluding growth from acquisitions of 1.1% and the effect of an increase in average silver prices in the Diversified Industrial segment of 0.1% , which were partially offset by the unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates of 0.2% , revenue decreased by 2.4% . The net revenue decrease of 2.4% was due to lower sales volume from our Diversified Industrial and Energy segments, partially offset by growth from the Financial Services segment. The acquisition growth was primarily due to the acquisitions of Dunmore (February 2018), PST (June 2018) and National Partners (April 2019). Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold in 2019 decreased $57,737 , or 5.2% , as compared to 2018 , primarily due to decreases in the Diversified Industrial and Energy segments. The decreases in the Diversified Industrial and Energy segments were primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by the impact of the Dunmore and PST acquisitions. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") in 2019 increased $4,009 , or 1.1% , as compared to 2018 , primarily due to the expense associated with a recent legal settlement in the Corporate and Other segment and higher personnel expenses to support growth initiatives and increasing regulatory compliance in the Financial Services segment, partially offset by decreases in the Diversified Industrial, excluding the Dunmore acquisition impact, and Energy segments due to lower sales volume and lower acquisition related costs. Goodwill Impairment Charges As a result of declines in customer demand and the performance of the packaging business during 2019 , the Company recorded a $41,853 charge in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 , to fully impair the packaging business' goodwill. There were no goodwill impairment charges recorded during 2018 . Asset Impairment Charges The asset impairment charges of $30,506 in 2019 were primarily associated with impairments of long-lived and intangible assets due to declines in the packaging business in the Company's Diversified Industrial segment. The impairment charges in 2018 of $8,108 were primarily associated with the loss of acquired customer relationships in the Company's packaging business. Interest Expense Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $41,409 and $39,234 , respectively. The higher interest expense in 2019 was primarily due to higher borrowing levels due to the Company's recent acquisitions and legal settlement described above and in Note 20 - " Commitments and Contingencies " found elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 24 Realized and Unrealized (Gains) Losses on Securities, Net Realized and unrealized (gains) losses on securities, net was a gain of $47,315 in 2019 , as compared to a loss of $62,586 in 2018 . The changes in realized and unrealized (gains) losses on securities over the respective periods are primarily due to mark-to-market adjustments on the Company's portfolio of securities, which are required to be recorded in earnings under U.S. GAAP. All Other Expenses, Net All other expenses, net were higher by $37,177 in 2019 , as compared to 2018 . The increase was primarily due to higher finance interest expense and a higher provision for loan losses, as compared to 2018 . Income Taxes As a limited partnership, we are generally not responsible for federal and state income taxes, and our profits and losses are passed directly to our limited partners for inclusion in their respective income tax returns. The Company's tax provision represents the income tax expense or benefit of its consolidated corporate subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , a tax provision of $15,865 was recorded, as compared to $12,559 in 2018 . Significant losses incurred by a corporate subsidiary together with losses incurred by the limited partnership, a flow-through entity, for both of which no tax benefits have been recorded, resulted in an effective tax rate of 57.1% based on the consolidated income before income taxes and equity method investments of $27,761 in 2019 . A similarly high consolidated effective tax rate was the case in 2018 , driven primarily by the same factors. Loss of Associated Companies, Net of Taxes The Company incurred a loss from associated companies, net of taxes, of $8,043 in 2019 , as compared to a loss of $9,509 in 2018 . For the details of each of these investments and the related mark-to-market adjustments in both periods, see Note 11 - " Investments " to the SPLP consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Segment Analysis Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Revenue: Diversified industrial $ 1,226,365 $ 1,286,665 Energy 163,972 175,950 Financial services 171,434 121,999 Total $ 1,561,771 $ 1,584,614 Segment (loss) income before interest expense and income taxes: Diversified industrial $ (20,430 ) $ 56,057 Energy (1,850 ) (9,012 ) Financial services 68,560 54,544 Corporate and other 14,847 (81,286 ) Income before interest expense and income taxes 61,127 20,303 Interest expense 41,409 39,234 Income tax provision 15,865 12,559 Net income (loss) $ 3,853 $ (31,490 ) Segment depreciation and amortization: Diversified industrial $ 54,141 $ 59,582 Energy 17,548 20,214 Financial services 423 397 Corporate and other 154 130 Total depreciation and amortization $ 72,266 $ 80,323 Loss of associated companies, net of taxes (included above): Corporate and other $ (8,043 ) $ (9,509 ) Total $ (8,043 ) $ (9,509 ) Diversified Industrial 25 Net sales in 2019 decreased by $60,300 , or 4.7% , as compared to 2018 . The change in net sales reflects $14,323 in incremental sales associated with the Dunmore (February 2018) and PST (June 2018) acquisitions and an increase of $2,100 as a result of higher average silver prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates of $3,918 . Excluding the acquisitions, foreign exchange rate impact and change in silver prices, net sales decreased by approximately $72,805 , primarily due to lower sales volume from the packaging and electrical products businesses, partially offset by higher sales volume in the building materials business. Segment operating income in 2019 decreased by $76,487 , or 136.4% , as compared to 2018 . The lower operating income was driven by $41,853 of goodwill impairment charges and $ 30,506 of asset impairment charges primarily associated with the packaging business and lower gross profit, as compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to lower sales volume from the packaging and electrical products businesses, partially offset by higher operating income from the building materials business on higher sales volume and as well as lower acquisition related costs in 2019 . Energy In 2019 , net revenue decreased $11,978 , or 6.8% , as compared to 2018 . The decrease in net revenue was primarily due to the Company's exit from certain low margin operations, as well as the adverse effects that the decline in energy prices has had on the oil services industry. Segment operating loss in 2019 decreased $7,162 , or 79.5% , as compared to 2018 . The reduction in operating loss was primarily due to higher gross profit and lower SG&A. The increase in gross profit was primarily the result of exiting low margin business that resulted in improved gross profit margin in 2019 , as compared to 2018 . Financial Services Revenue in 2019 increased $49,435 , or 40.5% , as compared to 2018 . The increase was due to higher interest income driven by larger outstanding loan receivable balances and increased volume in lending programs, as compared to 2018 . Segment operating income in 2019 increased $14,016 , or 25.7% , as compared to 2018 . The increase was due to the impact of the higher revenue discussed above, partially offset by higher expenses. SG&A increased primarily driven by higher personnel expenses to support growth initiatives and the continued expansion of WebBank's compliance and oversight group to meet increasing regulatory expectations. In addition, the provision for loan losses increased $24,315 and finance interest expense increased $5,991 in 2019 , as compared to 2018 . The higher provision for loan losses was to support growth of consumer and small business loans held to maturity, and the higher finance interest expense was due to a larger deposit balance to support loan growth and an increase in interest rates. Net Interest Income, Margin and Interest Rate Spreads Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. By its nature, net interest income is especially vulnerable to changes in the mix and amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, changes in the interest rates and yields associated with these assets and liabilities can significantly impact net interest income. The following table summarizes the average balances, the amount of interest earned or incurred and the applicable yields for interest-earning assets and the costs of interest-bearing liabilities that generate net interest income. For purposes of calculating the yields in these schedules, the average loan balances also include the principal amounts of nonaccrual and restructured loans. However, interest received on nonaccrual loans is included in income only to the extent that cash payments have been received and not applied to principal reductions. In addition, interest on restructured loans is generally accrued at reduced rates. 26 Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Average Interest Average Interest Outstanding Earned/ Yield/ Outstanding Earned/ Yield/ Balance Paid Rate Balance Paid Rate Interest-earning assets: Loans receivable $ 637,226 $ 106,489 16.7 % $ 396,538 $ 59,234 14.9 % Held-to-maturity securities 50,024 2,031 4.1 % 40,286 1,323 3.3 % Available-for-sale investments 2,925 56 1.9 % 2,624 64 2.4 % Federal funds sold 13,222 274 2.1 % 3,047 49 1.6 % Interest bearing deposits 162,252 3,204 2.0 % 234,198 4,026 1.7 % Total interest-earning assets 865,649 112,054 12.9 % 676,693 64,696 9.6 % Non interest-earning assets 19,549 17,965 Total assets $ 885,198 $ 694,658 Interest-bearing liabilities: Savings accounts $ 169,651 2,902 1.7 % $ 99,809 1,062 1.1 % Time deposits 533,146 13,380 2.5 % 460,201 9,226 2.0 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 702,797 16,282 2.3 % 560,010 10,288 1.8 % Other non interest-bearing liabilities 23,913 12,737 Total liabilities 726,710 572,747 Shareholder's equity 158,488 121,911 Total liabilities and shareholder's equity $ 885,198 $ 694,658 Net interest income $ 95,772 $ 54,408 Spread on average interest-bearing funds 10.6 % 7.7 % Net interest margin 11.1 % 8.0 % Return on assets 5.7 % 6.4 % Return on equity 31.6 % 36.5 % Equity to assets 17.9 % 17.5 % WebBank has several lending arrangements with companies where it originates credit card and other loans for consumers and small businesses. These loans are classified as held for sale and are typically sold after origination. The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on WebBank's net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately, based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

Loan groupings are created for each loan class and are then graded against historical and industry loss rates. After applying historic loss experience, as described above, we review the quantitatively derived level of ALLL for each segment using qualitative criteria. We track various risk factors that influence our judgment regarding the level of the ALLL across the portfolio segments. The following table summarizes activity in WebBank's allowance for loan and lease losses for the periods indicated: 28 As of December 31, 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 Balance at beginning of period $ 17,659 $ 5,237 $ 1,483 $ 630 $ 557 Charge offs: Commercial and industrial (8,667 ) (2,772 ) (933 ) Other (17,918 ) (4,549 ) (1,214 ) Total charge offs (26,585 ) (7,321 ) (2,147 ) Recoveries: Commercial real estate - owner occupied 22 20 17 14 25 Commercial real estate - other 35 44 Commercial and industrial 461 272 142 30 54 Other 1,752 393 103 Total recoveries 2,235 685 262 79 123 Net (charge offs) recoveries (24,350 ) (6,636 ) (1,885 ) 79 123 Additions charged to operations 43,373 19,058 5,639 774 (50 ) Balance at end of period $ 36,682 $ 17,659 $ 5,237 $ 1,483 $ 630 Ratio of net charge offs during the period to average loans outstanding during the period 3.8 % 1.7 % 0.8 % % (0.1 )% The distribution of WebBank's allowance for losses on loans at the dates indicated is summarized as follows: As of December 31, 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 Amount % of Loans in Each Category of Total Loans Amount % of Loans in Each Category of Total Loans Amount % of Loans in Each Category of Total Loans Amount % of Loans in Each Category of Total Loans Amount % of Loans in Each Category of Total Loans Commercial real estate - owner occupied $ 16 % $ 19 % $ 6 0.1 % $ 22 0.4 % $ 39 0.7 % Commercial real estate - other 8 0.1 % 7 0.1 % 7 0.1 % 7 0.2 % 9 0.1 % Commercial and industrial 10,920 32.2 % 6,165 28.0 % 2,800 30.8 % 880 32.6 % 582 29.1 % Other consumer loans 25,738 38.8 % 11,468 36.0 % 2,424 19.3 % 574 14.7 % % Loans held for sale 28.9 % 35.9 % 49.7 % 52.1 % 70.1 % Total loans $ 36,682 100.0 % $ 17,659 100.0 % $ 5,237 100.0 % $ 1,483 100.0 % $ 630 100.0 % Corporate and Other Segment operating income was $14,847 in 2019 , as compared to a loss of $81,286 in 2018 . The change was primarily due to higher investment income in 2019. The increase in 2019 was negatively impacted by legal expenses associated with a legal settlement.

DISCUSSION OF CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS The following table provides a summary of the Company's consolidated cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 : December 31, 2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 111,743 $ 52,751 Net cash used in investing activities (274,965 ) (366,429 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (36,146 ) 226,621 Net change for the period $ (199,368 ) $ (87,057 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities 29 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $111,743 . Net income of $3,853 was impacted by certain non-cash items and a net unfavorable change of $53,622 relating to certain operating assets and liabilities. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase of $36,870 in loans held for sale due to the timing of loan originations, which can vary significantly from period-to-period since these loans are typically sold after origination, as well as the level of activity at WebBank, a decrease of $30,706 in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities due primarily to higher pension contributions, a decrease of $20,694 in trade and other receivables due to timing of receipts, an increase in inventories of $9,491 to support sales growth in the Diversified Industrial segment, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $2,751 . Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $52,751 . Net loss of $31,490 was impacted by certain non-cash items and a net unfavorable change of $88,843 relating to certain operating assets and liabilities. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase of $ 51,370 in loans held for sale due to the timing of loan originations, which can vary significantly from period-to-period since these loans are typically sold after origination, as well as the level of activity at WebBank, an increase of $ 19,625 in trade and other receivables due to timing of receipts, an increase in inventories of $7,415 to support sales growth in the Diversified Industrial segment, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $7,851 . Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $274,965 . Significant items included loan originations, net of collections of $205,874 , proceeds from maturities and sales of investments (net of purchases) of $32,810 , net cash paid for the National Partners acquisition of $45,559 , purchases of property, plant and equipment of $43,024 and short position settlements of $14,611 . Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $366,429 . Significant items included purchases of property, plant and equipment of $ 47,085 , an increase in loan originations, net of collections of $ 203,885 , primarily due to larger outstanding loan balances, and net cash paid for acquisitions of $ 62,683 , primarily for the Dunmore acquisition, as well as purchases of investments (net of maturities and sales) of $ 56,269 , including the Company's investments in Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. ("BW") shares, partially offset by proceeds from the sales of assets of $ 5,909 . The Company's investments in BW shares totaled $ 76,261 in 2018 . Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $36,146 , including net revolver repayments of $64,712 , term loan repayments of $7,304 and cash used to purchase the Company's common units of $6,721 , partially offset by a net increase in WebBank's deposits of $43,406 . Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $226,621 , including net revolver borrowings of $65,315 and a net increase in WebBank's deposits of $200,311 . These increases were partially offset by cash used to purchase the Company's common units of $21,202 and $18,068 used to purchase subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests, primarily the acquisition of WFHC shares. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SPLP (excluding its operating subsidiaries, "Holding Company") is a diversified global holding company with assets that principally consist of the stock of its direct subsidiaries, equity method and other investments, and cash and cash equivalents. The Company works with its businesses to enhance the liquidity and operations of its businesses and increase long-term value for its unitholders and stakeholders through balance sheet improvements, capital allocation policies, and operational and growth initiatives, which are further described in Part I, Item 1 - "Business - Business Strategy." Management is utilizing the following strategies to continue to enhance liquidity: (1) continuing to implement improvements using the Steel Business System throughout all the Company's operations to increase sales and operating efficiencies, (2) supporting profitable sales growth both internally and potentially through acquisitions and (3) evaluating from time to time and as appropriate, strategic alternatives with respect to its businesses and/or assets. The Company continues to examine all of its options and strategies, including acquisitions, divestitures and other corporate transactions, to increase cash flow and stakeholder value. The Company's senior credit facility ("Credit Agreement") consists of a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $500,000 and a $200,000 term loan with quarterly amortization equating to 5.0% per annum. The Credit Agreement covers substantially all of the Company's subsidiaries, with the exception of WebBank. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based upon earnings and certain covenants, including a maximum ratio limit on Total Leverage and a minimum ratio 30 limit on Interest Coverage, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement is subject to certain mandatory prepayment provisions and restrictive and financial covenants , primarily the leverage ratios described above. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2019 . If the Company does not meet its financial covenants, and if it is unable to secure necessary waivers or other amendments from its lenders on terms acceptable to management, its ability to access available lines of credit could be limited, its debt obligations could be accelerated and liquidity could be adversely affected. The Credit Agreement will expire on November 14, 2022, and all outstanding amounts will be due and payable. The Holding Company and its operating businesses believe that they have access to adequate resources to meet their needs for normal operating costs, capital expenditures, pension payments, debt obligations and working capital for their existing business, as well as to fund its taxes, legal and environmental matters, for at least the next twelve months. These resources include cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash provided by operating activities and unused lines of credit. The Holding Company and its operating businesses' ability to satisfy their debt service obligations, to fund planned capital expenditures and required pension payments, and to make acquisitions or repurchase units under its common unit Repurchase Program will depend upon their future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the markets in which they operate, as well as financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond their control. As indicated above, there can be no assurances that the Holding Company and its operating businesses will continue to have access to their lines of credit if their financial performance does not satisfy the financial covenants set forth in their respective financing agreements, which could also result in the acceleration of their debt obligations by their respective lenders, adversely affecting liquidity. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company's working capital was $154,380 , as compared to working capital of $ 395,510 as of December 31, 2018 . The decline in working capital during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in retail depository accounts (current liabilities) to fund WebBank's operations, as opposed to the use of non-current brokered certificates of deposits. As of December 31, 2019 , the availability under the Credit Agreement was approximately $161,314 . During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , capital expenditures were $43,024 and $47,085 , respectively. The Company currently expects full year capital expenditures in the range of $30,000 to $39,000 in 2020. The Company and its subsidiaries have ongoing commitments as noted in the table below. These commitments include funding of the minimum requirements of its subsidiaries' pension plans. Required future pension contributions are estimated based upon assumptions such as discount rates on future obligations, assumed rates of return on plan assets and legislative changes. Actual future pension costs and required funding obligations will be affected by changes in the factors and assumptions described in the previous sentence, as well as other changes such as any plan termination or other acceleration events. WebBank manages its liquidity to provide adequate funds to meet anticipated financial obligations, such as certificate of deposit maturities and to fund customer credit needs. WebBank had $125,047 and $281,566 in cash and cash equivalents, time deposits placed at other institutions, and federal funds sold at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. WebBank had $40,000 and $35,000 in lines of credit from its correspondent banks at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. WebBank had $21,287 and $71,345 available from the Federal Reserve discount window at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Therefore, WebBank had a total of $186,334 and $387,911 in cash, lines of credit and access to the Federal Reserve Bank discount window at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, which represents approximately 19.4% and 44.5%, respectively, of WebBank's total assets. Contractual Commitments and Contingencies Our consolidated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 are identified in the table below: Payments Due By Period Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years Thereafter Total Debt obligations (a) $ 17,405 $ 391,136 $ $ $ 408,541 Estimated interest expense (a), (b) 16,036 30,611 46,647 Deposits (c) 615,495 135,984 3,238 754,717 Operating lease obligations 11,346 16,804 9,119 14,930 52,199 Finance lease obligations 2,005 3,717 3,012 809 9,543 Minimum pension contributions (d) 36,600 67,500 42,350 5,600 152,050 Preferred unit liability (e) 40,000 40,000 Total $ 738,887 $ 645,752 $ 57,719 $ 21,339 $ 1,463,697 (a) Assumes repayment of the remaining balance outstanding on the Credit Agreement on its contractual maturity date, November 14, 2022. The outstanding balance on SPLP's Credit Agreement will fluctuate before maturity, and the repayment dates and amounts may differ. (b) Estimated interest expense does not include non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs, which is included in interest expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The interest rates used to estimate future interest expense were based on interest rates at 31 December 31, 2019 . As the majority of the Company's long-term debt bears interest at variable rates, any future interest rate fluctuations will impact future cash payments. (c) Excludes interest. The average interest rate on deposits at December 31, 2019 was 2.09%, and interest rates ranged from 0.00% to 3.16%. (d) Represents total expected required minimum pension plan contributions to the Company's significant pension plans for 2020 , 2021 , 2022 , 2023 , 2024 and for the five years thereafter. Actual future pension costs and required funding obligations will be affected by changes in the factors and assumptions described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as other changes such as any plan termination or other acceleration events. The Company's other pension and post-retirement obligations are not significant individually or in the aggregate. (e) Represents redemption of 1,600,000 6.0% Series A preferred units, no par value, on the third anniversary of the original issuance date of the SPLP preferred units (February 7, 2020) at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference value of $25 per unit, in cash. In addition to the amount in the table above, the Partnership Agreement also specifies that if the SPLP preferred units are not redeemed earlier, then on the ninth anniversary of the original issuance date (February 7, 2026), the remaining SPLP preferred units will be redeemed. The redemption price will be $25 per unit in cash or in common units or a combination thereof, at the sole discretion of the Company's Board of Directors. Upon redemption, the holders of the SPLP preferred units will also receive any accumulated and unpaid distributions as of the redemption date. The SPLP preferred units entitle the holders to a cumulative quarterly cash or in-kind (or a combination thereof) distribution, if and when declared at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors. Environmental Liabilities Certain of the Company's facilities are subject to environmental remediation obligations. The Company has estimated its liability to remediate these sites and has recorded liabilities of $11,686 at December 31, 2019 . For further discussion regarding these commitments, among others, see Note 20 - " Commitments and Contingencies " to the Company's consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Deposits Deposits at WebBank at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows: 2019 2018 Current $ 615,495 $ 431,959 Long-term 139,222 279,352 Total $ 754,717 $ 711,311 The increase in deposits at December 31, 2019 , as compared to 2018 , is due to WebBank's asset growth. The average original maturity for time deposits at December 31, 2019 was 21 months, as compared to 23 months at December 31, 2018 . The following table details the maturity of time deposits as of December 31, 2019 : Maturity < 3 Months 3 to 6 Months 6 to 12 Months > 12 Months Total Certificate of deposits less than $100 $ 63,206 $ 99,334 $ 194,654 $ 135,972 $ 493,166 Certificate of deposits of $100 or more 1,279 2,972 779 3,250 8,280 Total certificates of deposits $ 64,485 $ 102,306 $ 195,433 $ 139,222 $ 501,446 Off-Balance Sheet Risk It is not the Company's usual business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements such as guarantees on loans and financial commitments, indemnification arrangements and retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity for securitization purposes. SPLP uses the same credit policy in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. WebBank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. In the normal course of business, these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of loans as part of WebBank's lending arrangements with Marketing Partners. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The contractual amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement WebBank has in particular classes of financial instruments. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , WebBank's undisbursed commitments under these instruments totaled $125,861 and $130,697 , respectively. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a borrower who meets the lending criteria established by WebBank through one of WebBank's lending agreements with its Marketing Partners, provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract with the counterparty to the lending arrangement. Commitments generally have fixed 32 expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee, and in some cases are subject to ongoing adjustment by WebBank. Since certain of the commitments are expected to expire without the credit being extended, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. WebBank evaluates each prospective borrower's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by WebBank upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower and WebBank's Marketing Partner. WebBank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. WebBank uses the same credit policy in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Critical Accounting Policies The Company's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on historical experience, expected future cash flows and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Note 2 - " Summary of Significant Accounting Policies " to the Company's consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and methods used by the Company. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net Goodwill, which is not amortized, represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, and test for impairment during the year if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Examples of such events would include pertinent macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance and other factors. An entity can choose between using the Step 0 approach or the Step 1 approach. For the Step 0 approach, an entity may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. An entity has an unconditional option to bypass the Step 0 assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. An entity may resume performing the Step 0 assessment in any subsequent period. For the Step 1 approach, which is a quantitative approach, the Company will calculate the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount. There are several methods that may be used to estimate a reporting unit's fair value, including the income approach, the market approach and/or the cost approach. The amount of impairment, if any, is determined by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge based on the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. The loss recognized should not exceed the total goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. For 2019 , the Company utilized the Step 0 approach for all of its reporting units, except for the packaging business, which includes the operations of API and Dunmore, and is within its Diversified Industrial segment. Based on its qualitative assessment, the Company does not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of its reporting units tested under this approach is less than its carrying value. The Company performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill associated with the packaging business as a result of declines in customer demand and the performance of the packaging business. In our 2018 Form 10-K, we previously disclosed that there was a risk of future goodwill impairment of the packaging business if the fair value of this reporting unit, and its associated assets, decreased in value due to further declines in market conditions or customer demand. As discussed in Note 9 - " Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net " to the SPLP consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Form 10-K, during the third quarter of 2019, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the packaging business was below its carrying amount. Accordingly, the Company performed an assessment using a discounted cash flow method with consideration of market comparisons, and determined that the fair value of the packaging business was less than its carrying amount. As a result, the Company fully impaired the packaging business' goodwill and recorded a $41,853 charge in Goodwill impairment charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations found elsewhere in this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 . 33 For 2018, the Company utilized the Step 0 approach for all of its reporting units, except for the packaging business within its Diversified Industrial segment. There were no goodwill impairment charges recorded as a result of these assessments. For definite-lived intangible assets, the Company evaluates the carrying amount of such assets when circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the long-lived assets are deteriorating business climate, condition of the asset or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life. If the assets' carrying amounts exceed the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amounts exceed their fair values. The Company performs such assessments at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities, which is generally at the plant level, operating company level or the reporting unit level, depending on the level of interdependencies in the Company's operations. During 2019 and 2018 , the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges totaling $ 3,078 and $8,108 , respectively, primarily due to declines in the Company's packaging business. Intangible assets with indefinite lives, which are only within the Diversified Industrial segment, are tested for impairment at least annually, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. Companies can use the same two testing approaches for indefinite-lived intangibles as for goodwill. For 2019 and 2018 , the Company utilized the Step 0 approach to assess its intangible assets with indefinite lives, except for the indefinite lives intangible assets of Dunmore, which utilized a Step 1 approach in 2019 . The results of these tests indicated no impairment in either of these years. Long-Lived Asset Testing The Company's accounting policy for long-lived assets is to estimate the depreciable lives of property, plant and equipment, and to depreciate such assets over such lives. The Company tests long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets exceed the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amounts exceeds their fair values. The Company performs such assessments at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities, which is generally at the plant level, operating company level or the reporting unit level, depending on the level of interdependencies in the Company's operations. The Company considers various factors in determining whether an impairment test is necessary, including among other things: a significant or prolonged deterioration in operating results and projected cash flows; significant changes in the extent or manner in which assets are used; technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete; the Company's strategy and capital planning; and the economic climate in the markets it serves. When estimating future cash flows and if necessary, fair value, the Company makes judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets. The Company considers historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and other information available at the time the estimates are made. The Company believes these estimates are reasonable; however, changes in circumstances or conditions could have a significant impact on its estimates, which might result in material impairment charges in the future. As discussed in Note 6 - " Asset Impairment Charges " to the SPLP consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-K, as a result of declines in market conditions and customer demand at API, which is in the Company's packaging business in its Diversified Industrial segment, the Company performed a recoverability test as of December 31, 2019 to determine if the carrying amount of API's long-lived assets were recoverable based on their undiscounted cash flows over their future service potential. The testing performed indicated that API's long-lived assets may not be recoverable and accordingly, the fair value of these assets was estimated in order to determine if they were impaired as of December 31, 2019 . The Company used both cost and market approaches in determining the fair value of API's long-lived assets. As a result of this testing, the Company determined that the carrying value of API's long-lived assets, primarily machinery and equipment and buildings, exceeded their estimated market value by $ 26,514 . The Company recorded this impairment in Asset Impairment Charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 , found elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Costs Some of the Company's subsidiaries maintain qualified and non-qualified pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. The Company recorded pension expense of $8,115 for the year ended December 31, 2019 related to its significant pension plans, and, at December 31, 2019 , the Company had recorded pension liabilities totaling $196,077 . Pension benefits are generally based on years of service and the amount of compensation earned during the participants' employment. However, the qualified pension benefits have been frozen for all participants. 34 The pension and other post-retirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount and mortality rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Material changes in pension and other post-retirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions, changes in the number of plan participants, changes in the level of benefits provided, changes to the level of contributions to these plans and other factors. Actuarial assumptions for its pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are determined each year to calculate liability information as of year end, and pension and other post-retirement benefit expense or income for the following year. The discount rate assumption is derived from the rate of return on high-quality bonds. The various pension plan assets are diversified as to type of assets, investment strategies employed and number of investment managers used. Investments may include equities, fixed income, cash equivalents, convertible securities and private investment funds. Derivatives may be used as part of the investment strategy. The transfer of assets may be directed between investment managers in order to rebalance the portfolio in accordance with asset allocation guidelines established by the Company. The private investment funds, or the investment funds they are invested in, own marketable and non-marketable securities and other investment instruments. Such investments are valued by the private investment funds, underlying investment managers or the underlying investment funds at fair value, as described in their respective financial statements and offering memorandums. These values are utilized in quantifying the value of the assets of its pension plans, which are then used in the determination of the unfunded pension liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation of some of the pension plans' investments in private investment funds and the nature of some of the underlying investments held by the investment funds, the recorded value may differ from the value that would have been used had a ready market existed for some of these investments for which market quotations are not readily available. Management uses judgment to make assumptions on which its employee benefit liabilities and expenses are based. The effect of a 1% change in discount rate or expected return on asset assumptions for the pension plans sponsored by the Company's subsidiaries would not be material to the Company. Loan Impairment and Allowance for Loan Losses A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that WebBank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, including scheduled interest payments. When a loan has been identified as being impaired, the amount of impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or, when appropriate, the loan's observable fair value or the fair value of the collateral (less any selling costs) if the loan is collateral-dependent. If the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (including accrued interest, net of deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or discount), an impairment is recognized by creating or adjusting an existing allocation of the ALLL, or by charging down the loan to its value determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The ALLL is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when the uncollectability of a loan or receivable balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The ALLL is evaluated on a regular basis and is based upon a periodic review of the collectability of the amounts due in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as doubtful, substandard or loss. For such loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers non-classified loans and is based on historical loss experience and is adjusted for qualitative factors to cover uncertainties that could affect the estimate of probable losses. The ALLL is increased by charges to income and decreased by charge-offs (net of recoveries). The periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on WebBank's past loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the debtor's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral and current economic conditions. Since our loss rates are applied to large pools of loans, even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect management's determination of the appropriate ALLL because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio. Income Taxes As a limited partnership, we are generally not responsible for federal and state income taxes, and our profits and losses are passed directly to our limited partners for inclusion in their respective income tax returns. Our subsidiaries that are corporate subsidiaries are subject to federal and state income taxes. The table in Note 17 - " Income Taxes " to the SPLP consolidated financial statements, found elsewhere in this Form 10-K, reconciles a hypothetical calculation of federal income taxes based on the federal 35 statutory rate applied to the income or loss before income taxes and equity method investments. The tax effect of income passed through to common unitholders is subtracted from the hypothetical calculation. Our subsidiaries that are subject to income taxes use the liability method of accounting for such taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Our subsidiaries evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that most positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is provided for and reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated balance sheets, along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.
