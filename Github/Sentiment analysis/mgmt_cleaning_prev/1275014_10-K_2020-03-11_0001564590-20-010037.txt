Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, continues, may, will be, will continue, will likely results, and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors above. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statement and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this report. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Overview We are a global leader in the design, engineering and manufacture of production tools, modules and subsystems for the semiconductor and display capital equipment markets. Our products include chemical delivery modules, frame assemblies, gas delivery systems, fluid delivery systems, precision robotics, process modules as well as other high level assemblies. Our services provide part cleaning, surface encapsulation, and high sensitivity micro contamination analysis primarily for the semiconductor device makers and wafer fabrication (WFE) equipment markets. With our acquisition of Quantum Global Technologies, LLC ( QGT ), on August 27, 2018, a leader in parts cleaning, coating and foundry related analytical services, we expanded our capabilities to provide ultra-high purity parts cleaning , process tool part recoating, surface treatment, and analytical services to the semiconductor and related industries. Historically, the Company has operated under one operating segment. However, as a result of the acquisition of QGT, the Company created an additional segment in the first quarter of 2019. We elected to reorganize our organizational and reporting structure to capture efficiencies and operating leverage from our recent acquisition of QGT. We now report results for two segments: Semiconductor Products and Solutions ( Products or SPS ) and Semiconductor Services Business ( Services or SSB ). On April 15, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Dynamic Manufacturing Solutions, LLC ("DMS"), a semiconductor weldment and solutions provider. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we paid $29.9 million in cash for DMS, subject to certain post-closing adjustments as provided in the Acquisition Agreement. We may pay up to $12.5 million in additional cash earn-out payments to the former owners of DMS if, post-acquisition, the combined weldment business achieves certain gross profit and gross margin targets for the twelve months ending June 26, 2020. DMS reports into the SPS segment. We ship a majority of our products and provide most of our services to U.S. registered customers with locations both in and outside the U.S. In addition to U.S. manufacturing and service operations, we manufacture products and provide parts cleaning and other related services in our Asian and European facilities to support local and U.S. based customers. We conduct our operating activities primarily through our subsidiaries, Ultra Clean Technology Systems and Service, Inc., American Integration Technologies, LL, Ultra Clean Micro-Electronics Equipment (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Ultra Clean Asia Pacific, Pte, Ltd., UCT Thermal Solutions, Inc., UCT Fluid Delivery Solutions s.r.o.( FDS ), QGT and DMS. Over the long-term, we believe the semiconductor market we serve will continue to grow based on demand from a broad range of drivers, including applications such as autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things, high performance computing, artificial intelligence, and technology to support the data sharing economy. We also believe that semiconductor equipment OEMs are increasingly relying on partners like UCT to fulfill their expanding capacity requirements. 35 Critical A ccounting Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure at the date of our consolidated financial statements. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenues, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets and income taxes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, accounting for income taxes, business combinations, valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each. Revenue Recognition Our revenues for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 were highly concentrated in a small number of OEM customers in the semiconductor capital equipment industry. Our standard arrangement for our customers includes a signed purchase order or contract, no right of return of delivered products and no customer acceptance provisions. We perform the following five steps to determine when to recognize revenue: identification of the contract(s) with customers; identification of the performance obligations in the contract; determination of the transaction price; allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue is recognized when promised goods or services (performance obligations) are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history. We perform on-going credit evaluations of, and do not require collateral from, our customers. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make it more difficult for us to assess collectability. Inventory Valuation We write down the carrying value of our inventory to net realizable value for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon inventory age and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. We assess the valuation of all inventories, including raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods and spare parts on a periodic basis. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of our estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value less costs to sell, if less than its cost. The inventory write-downs are recorded as an inventory valuation allowance established on the basis of obsolete inventory or specifically identified inventory in excess of established usage. Inherent in our estimates of demand and market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends, future demand for our products and technological obsolescence of our products. If actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value, and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value, the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold either as a component of a subsystem or as separate inventory. For fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, we wrote down inventory of $2.6 million, $3.3 million, and $2.4 million, respectively. 36 Accounting for Income Taxes The determination of our tax provision is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region and is subject to judgments and estimates. Management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective tax rate as required. The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of future tax deductions, assumes we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully realize these deductions. In determining whether the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired, we make judgments with respect to whether we are likely to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these assets. In order to reverse a valuation allowance, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America suggest that we review our recent cumulative income/loss as well as determine our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our net deferred tax assets. As of December 27, 2019, we maintained full valuation allowances on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets in the amount of $23.1 million as we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on the results of our operations and financial position. We believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax position, however, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than what we expect. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states and foreign jurisdictions. Our 2016 through 2018 federal income tax returns are open to audit through the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company 2015 through 2018 state income tax returns are open to audit by the California Franchise Tax Board. The Company is also subject to examination in various other jurisdictions for various periods. Business Combinations In accordance with accounting for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We may engage third-party valuation firms to assist management in reviewing management determination of the fair values of acquired intangible assets such as customer relationships and tradenames. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Goodwill, Intangibles Assets, and Long-lived Assets Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed. We evaluate our goodwill and indefinite life tradename for impairment on an annual basis, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. In addition, we evaluate our identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following: Significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business; Significant negative changes in revenue of specific products or services; Significant negative industry or economic trends; and Significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period. 37 We continually app ly judgment when performing these evaluations and continuously monitor for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions in determining fair value, including long-term revenue growth projections, undiscounted cash flows, discoun t rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in our market capitalization and general industry, market and macroeconomic conditions. It is possible that changes in such circumstances, or in the variables associate d with the judgments, assumptions and estimates used in assessing fair value, would require us to record a non-cash impairment charge. Results of Operations Fiscal Year Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Friday nearest December 31. Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 each contained 52 weeks . A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 22, 2019, which is available on the SEC website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at ww.uct.com/investors. Discussion of Results of Operations The financial information for SSB represents a full twelve months of QGT activity in 2019 compared to four months of activity in 2018 as QGT was acquired on August 27, 2018. The financial information for SPS represents eight months of activity in 2019 for DMS as DMS was acquired on April 15, 2019.

United States revenue increased in absolute terms and as a percentage of total revenue due, in part, to our acquisition of DMS, whose customers are primarily based in the United States. The decrease in foreign revenues in absolute terms and as a percentage of total revenue is due primarily to lower semiconductor demands. Gross Margin Years Ended (Dollars in millions) December 27, Percent December 28, Percent December 29, Dollar by Segment 2019 Change 2018 Change 2017 SPS $ 121.8 (19.0 ) % $ 150.3 (10.4 ) % $ 167.7 SSB 75.0 194.1 % 25.5 n/m - Gross profit $ 196.8 $ 175.8 $ 167.7 Gross Margin Percentage by Segment SPS 14.5 % 14.8 % 18.1 % SSB 33.3 % 31.5 % n/m Total Company 18.5 % 16.0 % 18.1 % Cost of revenues consists primarily of purchased materials, labor and overhead, including depreciation related to certain capital assets associated with the design and manufacture of products sold. SPS gross profit decreased in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 due primarily to lower revenues. SPS gross margin decreased in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, due primarily to a change in product mix with lower product margins. SSB gross profit increased in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 due primarily to the acquisition of QGT which contributed a full year of financial results in 2019 compared to four months of financial results in 2018. SSB gross margin increased in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 due primarily to a change in product mix as well as an improvement in labor efficiencies.

Other income (expense), net increased in fiscal year 2019 over fiscal year 2018 , primarily due to a $4.1 million net increase in fair value of the contingent earn-out liabilities recorded in conjunction with the acquisitions of DMS and QGT . The $4.1 million net increase is composed of the increase in DMS earn-out liability of $8.0 million since its acquisition date, offset by a $3.9 million reduction of the QGT earn-out liability. This net increase was offset by a $1.5 million decrease in fair value of our liability related to our obligation to purchase the common stock owned by one of the Cinos Korea shareholders. 40 Provision for Income Taxes Years Ended December 27, Percent December 28, Percent December 29, (Dollars in millions) 2019 Change 2018 Change 2017 Provision for income taxes $ 10.0 (34.6 ) % $ 15.3 28.6 % $ 11.9 Effective tax rate 415.9 % 29.3 % 13.6 % For fiscal year 2019, income tax expense was $10.0 million compared to $15.3 million for fiscal year 2018. For fiscal year 2019, our effective tax rate was 415.9% compared to 29.3% for fiscal year 2018. The change in respective tax rates reflects, primarily, changes in the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings. For fiscal year 2019, our effective tax rate was higher than the statutory rates primarily due to the effects of the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings in foreign jurisdictions with different tax rates, unfavorable book to tax differences related to U.S. tax reform, primarily income in foreign jurisdictions which cannot be offset against losses in the U.S., which is in full valuation allowance. For the year ended December 27, 2019, the Company concluded that a full valuation allowance against its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets continues to be necessary. The Company also concluded that some of its foreign deferred tax assets acquired as part of the QGT acquisition required a valuation allowance. As of December 27, 2019, the total U.S. and foreign valuation allowances for deferred tax assets was $23.1 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Our ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. In assessing our future taxable income, we have considered all sources of future taxable income available to realize our deferred tax assets, including the taxable income from future reversal of existing temporary differences, carry forwards, and tax-planning strategies. If changes occur in the assumptions underlying our tax planning strategies or in the scheduling of the reversal of our deferred tax liabilities, the valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future. The Company remitted earnings from its subsidiaries in Singapore and China in 2019 and the Company has no future plans to remit earnings other than possibly remitting earnings out of its Singapore entity. We may change our intent to reinvest our undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely, which could require us to accrue or pay taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash Equivalents The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents: Years Ended December 27, December 28, (In millions) 2019 2018 Increase Total cash and cash equivalents $ 162.5 $ 144.1 $ 18.4 The increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the cash provided by operating activities of $121.0 million, partially offset by the $29.9 million acquisition of DMS, $26.3 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment and net debt payments of $50.7 million. 41 Cash Flows Years Ended December 27, December 28, December 29, (In millions) 2019 2018 2017 Operating activities $ 121.0 $ 41.7 $ 48.9 Investing activities (49.2 ) (345.9 ) (16.1 ) Financing activities (53.4 ) 380.1 (17.1 ) Effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents - (0.1 ) 0.1 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 18.4 $ 75.8 $ 15.8 Our primary cash inflows and outflows were as follows: We generated net cash from operating activities of $121.0 million in fiscal year 2019, compared to $41.7 million in fiscal year 2018. The $79.3 million increase was driven by an increase of $100.1 million in the net change from operating assets and liabilities and an increase of $23.9 million in non-cash items offset by a decrease of $44.7 million in net income. The major contributors to the net change in operating assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisition, in fiscal year 2019 were as follows: o Accounts receivable increased $4.5 million primarily due to timing of collections. o Inventories decreased $22.3 million due primarily to lower SPS revenues together with better management of supply chain and inventories on hand. o Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased $3.7 million due primarily to amortization of prepaid expenses. o Accounts payable increased $31.0 million, accrued compensation and related benefits increased $9.0 million, and other liabilities increased $6.3 million, primarily due to the timing of payments. Cash used in investing activities was $49.2 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to $345.9 million in fiscal year 2018. During fiscal year 2019, net cash used for investing activities primarily consisted of $29.9 million for the DMS acquisition and $26.3 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment, offset by $7.0 million in proceeds from insurance and sale of property, plant and equipment. During fiscal year 2018, net cash used for investing activities primarily consisted of $319.8 million, net of cash acquired, for the QGT acquisition and $26.1 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. Cash used in financing activities was $53.4 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $380.1 million in fiscal year 2018. During fiscal year 2019, net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of $50.7 million net of debt repayments, $0.5 million finance leases payments, $0.6 million dividends payments made to a joint venture shareholder and $1.9 million of taxes paid upon the vesting of restricted stock units. During fiscal year 2018, the cash provided by financing activities primarily included net bank borrowings of $300.7 million and $94.3 million net cash proceeds from the public offering of our common stock in February of 2018, offset by $12.1 million payment of debt issuance costs and $3.1 million of taxes paid upon vesting of restricted stock units. We believe we have sufficient capital to fund our working capital needs, satisfy our debt obligations, maintain our existing capital equipment, purchase new capital equipment and make strategic acquisitions from time to time. As of December 27, 2019, we had cash of $162.5 million compared to $144.1 million as of December 28, 2018. Our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and amounts available under our revolving line of credit described below were our principal sources of liquidity as of December 27, 2019. In February of 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 4,761,905 shares of our common stock, in which we received net proceeds of approximately $94.3 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and offering expenses payable by us. 42 In August 2 018, in conjunction with the acquisition of QGT, we entered into a credit agreement with Barclays Bank that provided a Term Loan, a Revolving Credit Facility, and a Letter of Credit Facility (the Credit Facilities ). See further discussion under Borrowin g Arrangements below. We anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents balance and operating cash flow will be sufficient to service our indebtedness and meet our working capital requirements and technology development projects for at least the next twelve months. The adequacy of these resources to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth, the size and number of any acquisitions, the state of the worldwide economy, our ability to meet our financial covenants with our credit facility, the cyclical expansion or contraction of the semiconductor capital equipment industry and the other industries we serve and capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our products. In order to expand our business or acquire additional complementary businesses or technologies, we may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings. If required, additional financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders equity interest will be diluted and these securities might have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders. We may also require the consent of our new lenders to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that, if available, such financing can be obtained on terms favorable to our stockholders and us. In 2017, we determined that a portion of the current year and future year earnings of one of our China subsidiaries may be remitted in the future to one of our foreign subsidiaries outside of mainland China and, accordingly, we provided for the related withholding taxes in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 27, 2019, we had undistributed earnings of approximately $217.0 million from our foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely invested outside of the U.S. As of December 27, 2019, we have cash of approximately $126.7 million in our foreign subsidiaries. Borrowing Arrangements December 27, 2019 (Dollars in millions) Amount Weighted- Average Interest Rate U.S. Term Loan $ 300.0 6.9% U.S. Revolving Credit Facility - 4.7% FDS Revolving Credit Facility 1.9 1.0% $ 301.9 In August 2018, we entered into a credit agreement with Barclays Bank that provided a Term Loan, a Revolving Credit Facility and a Letter of Credit Facility (the Credit Facility ). We and some of our subsidiaries have agreed to secure all of our obligations under the Credit Facility by granting a first priority lien in substantially all of our respective personal property assets (subject to certain exceptions and limitations). In connection with this Credit Facility, we borrowed $350.0 million under the Term Loan and used the proceeds, together with cash on hand, to finance the acquisition of QGT (see Note 2) and to refinance our previous credit facilities. In August 2018, we paid $41.6 million of principal, accrued interest, and fees in settlement of the then-outstanding term loan, revolving credit facility, interest rate swap under the Credit Agreement, and recognized $0.1 million in expense upon extinguishment of debt as Interest and other income (expense), net. The Term Loan has a maturity date of August 27, 2025, with monthly interest payments in arrears, quarterly principal payments of 0.625% of the original outstanding principal balance payable beginning in January 2019, with the remaining principal paid upon maturity. The Term Loan accrues interest daily at a rate equal to a base LIBOR rate determined by reference to the London interbank offered rate for dollars, plus 4.5% (subject to certain adjustments quarterly based upon the Company consolidated leverage ratio). At December 27, 2019 , we had an outstanding amount under the Term Loan of $300.0 million, gross of unamortized debt issuance costs of $9.7 million. As of December 27, 2019 , the interest rate on the outstanding Term Loan was 6.2%. On December 31, 2021, LIBOR will officially be phased out. The Company will work with its bank to determine alternative risk-free rates. 43 The Revolving Credit Facility has an initial available commitment of $65.0 million and a maturity date of August 27, 2023. We pay a quarterly commitment fee in arrears equal to 0.25% of the average daily av ailable commitment outstanding. During the second quarter of 2019 , we borrowed $15.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of DMS, and as of December 27, 2019 , we had no amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. The New Credit Agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants including a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of at least 1.25 to 1.00, and a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of no greater than 3.75 to 1.00. We were in compliance with all covenants for the quarter ended December 27, 2019. The Letter of Credit Facility has an initial available commitment of $50.0 million and a maturity date of August 27, 2023. We pay quarterly in arrears a fee equal to 2.5% (subject to certain adjustments as per the Term Loans) of the dollar equivalent of all outstanding letters of credit, and a fronting fee equal to 0.125% of the undrawn and unexpired amount of each letter of credit. As of December 27, 2019, we have no outstanding letters of credit and the remaining available commitments was $65.0 million. As of December 27, 2019, FDS had an outstanding amount under its revolving credit facility of 1.7 million euros (approximately $1.9 million) with an interest rate of 0.9%. We have partial ownership in a South Korean company, Cinos Korea, Ltd ( Cinos ), which Cinos has Credit Agreements with various banks that provide Revolving Credit Facilities for a total available commitment of 1.9 billion Korean Won (approximately $1.7 million) with annual renewals beginning in April 2020 through October 2020 and interest rates ranging from 1.4% - 5.4%. During the fiscal year ended December 27, 2019, borrowings under these Revolving Facilities were insignificant and no amounts were outstanding as of December 27, 2019 . As of December 27, 2019, our total bank debt was $292.2 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $9.7 million. As of December 27, 2019, we had $65.0 million and 6.5 million euros (approximately $7.3 million) available to draw from our revolving credit facilities in the U.S. and Czech Republic, respectively. The fair value of our long term debt was based on Level 2 inputs, and fair value was determined using quoted prices for similar liabilities in inactive markets. The carrying value of our long term debt approximates fair value. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $25.7 million for the year ended December 27, 2019 , primarily attributable to the expansion of our South Korea, Singapore, Czech Republic and certain U.S. facilities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the periods presented, we do not have unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In conjunction with the sale of our products in the ordinary course of business, we provide standard indemnification against certain liabilities, which may include claims of losses by their own customers resulting out of property damages, bodily injuries or deaths, or infringement of intellectual property rights by our products. Our potential liability arising out of intellectual property infringement claims by any third party is generally uncapped. As of December 27, 2019, we have not incurred any significant costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification arrangements. As a result, we believe the estimated fair value of these arrangements is minimal. 44 Contractual Obligations Other than operating leases for certain equipment and real estate and purchase order commitments primarily for inventory, we have no off-balance sheet transactions or similar instruments and, other than the arrangements described under Borrowing Arrangements above and our stock purchase obligation resulted from the acquisition of QGT, are not a guarantor of any other entities debt or other financial obligations.
