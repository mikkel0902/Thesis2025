ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 1A Risk factors and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis presents financial information denominated in millions of dollars which can lead to differences from rounding when compared to similar information contained in the consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are primarily denominated in thousands of dollars. Executive Summary We are the world leading cloud software company powering social good. Serving the entire social good community nonprofits, foundations, companies, education institutions, healthcare organizations and individual change agents we connect and empower organizations and individuals to increase their impact through cloud software, services, expertise and data intelligence. Our portfolio is tailored to the unique needs of vertical markets, with solutions for fundraising and CRM, marketing, advocacy, peer-to-peer fundraising, corporate social responsibility, school management, ticketing, grantmaking, financial management, payment processing and analytics. Serving the industry for more than three decades, we are headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina and have operations in the United States, Australia, Canada, Costa Rica and the United Kingdom. As of December 31, 2019 , we had over 45,000 global customers. Our revenue is primarily generated from the following sources: (i) charging for the use of our software solutions in cloud and hosted environments; (ii) providing payment and transaction services; (iii) providing software maintenance and support services; and (iv) providing professional services, including implementation, consulting, training, analytic and other services. Four-Point Growth Strategy 1 Delight Customers with Innovative Cloud Solutions 2 Drive Sales Effectiveness 3 Expand Total Addressable Market 4 Improve Operating Efficiency 1. Delight Customers with Innovative Cloud Solutions This strategy reflects our relentless focus on driving value and outcomes for our customers through our solutions. Blackbaud SKY , our platform for cloud innovation, is a core tenant of this strategy and continues to power an elevated level of innovation by our engineers. It is also enabling our growing ecosystem of partners who are also passionate about social good, to extend and expand the capabilities available to our customers. For the first time in the history of the Company, beginning in 2019, there are now significantly more outside developers developing on our platform than Blackbaud engineers. The customers we serve require vertical specific business solutions to automate their operations. In October 2019, we announced the general availability of Blackbaud Church Management , which is already transforming the faith community technology landscape. We now serve congregations in more than half of the 50 U.S. states, representing all different sizes and spanning more than 13 denominations. Bringing this solution to market is a significant step toward addressing several challenges in the faith market and a substantial opportunity for Blackbaud. We are seeing positive momentum as more functionality continues to be released, market awareness is increasing and win rates are improving. 30 2019 Form 10-K Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc. We are also seeing momentum continue to build in our Higher Education Vertical where Blackbaud powers 24 of the top 25 private U.S. colleges as ranked by Forbes. A year after introducing the Cloud Solution for Higher Education, we continue to drive innovation and introduce solutions taking full advantage of the rapid innovation, modern user experience, and enhanced capabilities made possible by our Blackbaud SKY platform. We extended our industry proven Education Management portfolio up market to small-scale higher education institutions. We are seeing strong sales momentum and look forward to seeing these customers begin to go-live in 2020. We also recently introduced talent management capabilities as part of the Cloud Solution for Higher Education, providing institutions the first online performance tracking tool for fundraising leaders and managers, enabling transparency, proactive management and peer gift officer benchmarking. Blackbaud Peer-to-Peer Fundraising powered by JustGiving continues to gain traction. Since the U.S. launch in early 2019, over 1,000 customers have signed up to use the solution and roughly half of these organizations are net new customers to Blackbaud. 2. Drive Sales Effectiveness We have been investing in sales and marketing to better address our market opportunity with a focus on adding additional sales headcount, improving productivity and putting a greater focus on adding net new logos. One way we are equipping our growing salesforce to be more effective is by investing in the necessary technology and resources to efficiently drive an increased number of quality leads and better cover our large addressable market. We have grown our lead generation teams, which we call business development representatives, to support our growing sales teams. We have simultaneously increased the productivity of our business development representatives with the implementation of a leading sales engagement technology platform, enabling our teams to generate more prospects, and convert those prospects into sales opportunities. We are entering 2020 with an improved ratio of business development representatives to account executives, and the lead generation from the team has increased substantially as a result of these changes. We have also implemented software tools to enhance our digital footprint and drive lead generation across the company. For the first time ever, we are taking a multi-touch attribution approach to measuring the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns to drive efficiency in our go-to-market efforts and improve returns on our marketing dollars. This is just one of many examples of how we are optimizing our structure, tools and processes to better address our large vertical market opportunities. We have made significant strides in laying the foundation to develop a highly productive and scalable operating model, which included significant organizational structure changes as we centralized many back-office functions and aligned our go-to-market efforts by vertical. This transformation is now behind us, putting us in a position to drive improved productivity across our vertical sales teams. 3. Expand TAM In January 2019, we acquired YourCause, which positions us as a global leader in corporate social responsibility and employee engagement technology. One third of Fortune 500 companies trust Blackbaud as their CSR technology partner, and in 2019 alone, YourCause solutions processed over $1 billion dollars in donations and grants which benefited over 170,000 social good organizations. In the year since the acquisition, we have fully integrated YourCause's administrative functions into our global centers of excellence and expanded the sales team to fuel what is already a fast-growing business within the company. Our TAM now stands at over $10 billion, and we remain active in the evaluation of opportunities to further expand our addressable market through acquisitions and internal product development. 4. Improve Operating Efficiency We are also focused on operational efficiency to strengthen the business and position us for long-term success. During 2019, we continued executing a comprehensive workplace strategy to better align our organizational objectives with our geographic footprint. We designated Charleston, South Carolina, Austin, Texas, London, U.K. and Sydney, Australia as our hub locations, and we have leveraged a more flexible office strategy to replace and upgrade some of our former offices and expand our footprint into new locations for customer-facing roles. Most recently, we moved our London offices into a new flexible workspace marking a significant milestone in the integration of our Blackbaud Europe and JustGiving teams. In 2019, we largely completed this optimization effort, and we will continue to evaluate our footprint in alignment with our global workplace strategy. Our aim is optimizing our office utilization, improving our geographic sales coverage and enhancing our employees' daily experience to improve productivity and effectiveness. 2019 Form 10-K 31 Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc. Total Revenue ($M) Income from Operations ($M) YoY Growth (%) YoY Growth (%) Total revenue increased by $51.8 million during 2019 , driven largely by the following: + Growth in recurring revenue related to positive demand from customers across our portfolio of cloud solutions and, to a lesser extent, the inclusion of YourCause, an increase in services embedded in our renewable cloud solution contracts and increased sales of subscription-based contracts for retained professional services - Decline in one-time services and other revenue from our continued shift in focus towards selling cloud subscription solutions. In general, our cloud solutions include integrated analytics, training and payment services, and require little to no customization services. As a result, we expect that one-time services and other revenue will continue to decline and total revenue growth will continue to be negatively impacted. Income from operations decreased by $32.3 million during 2019 , driven largely by the following: + Growth in total revenue, as described above - Increased investments we have made in our sales organization and innovation - Increase in stock-based compensation of $10.4 million, due to increases in the grant date fair values of our annual equity awards granted to employees over the last three years as our headcount has grown - Increase in hosting and data center costs of $5.4 million as we are migrating our cloud infrastructure to leading public cloud service providers - Increase in amortization of software development costs of $4.1 million due to investments made on innovation, quality and the integration of our cloud solutions - Increase in amortization of intangible assets from business combinations of $3.0 million - Increase in employee severance of $2.2 million related to the elimination of certain roles within the company, most of which occurred during the first quarter of 2019 - Increase in rent expense of $1.8 million primarily associated with the lease of our New Headquarters Facility in Charleston, South Carolina, which commenced in April 2018 - Increase in restructuring costs of $1.2 million Customer Retention Our recurring revenue contracts are generally for a term of three years at contract inception with one to three-year renewals thereafter. We anticipate a continued decrease in maintenance contract renewals as we transition our solution portfolio 32 2019 Form 10-K Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc. and maintenance customers from a perpetual license-based model to a cloud subscription delivery model. In the long term, we also anticipate an increase in recurring subscription contract renewals as we continue focusing on innovation, quality and the integration of our cloud solutions, which we believe will provide value-adding capabilities to better address our customers' needs. Due primarily to these factors, we believe a recurring revenue customer retention measure that combines recurring subscription, maintenance and service customer contracts provides a better representation of our customers' overall behavior. During 2019 and 2018 , approximately 92% of our customers with recurring revenue contracts were retained. This customer retention rate reflects our efforts to rationalize our portfolio of solutions and migrate customers from legacy solutions towards our next generation cloud solutions. We are investing in innovation, which we believe will increase customer retention over the long-term. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow At December 31, 2019 , our cash and cash equivalents were $31.8 million and the carrying amount of our debt under the 2017 Credit Facility (as described below) was $467.1 million . Our net leverage ratio was 2.30 to 1.00 . During 2019 , we generated $182.5 million in cash flow from operations, had net cash outlays of $109.4 million , primarily for the acquisition of YourCause, returned $23.6 million to stockholders by way of dividends and had cash outlays of $58.4 million for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs. Adoption of New Lease Accounting Standard On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, using the transition method that allowed us to initially apply the guidance at the adoption date of January 1, 2019 without adjusting comparative periods presented. Adopting ASU 2016-02 had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets as we recognized lease liabilities and ROU assets for those leases classified as operating leases. The impacts of adoption are reflected in the financial information herein. For additional information regarding the impact of our adoption of ASU 2016-02, see Notes 2 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements in this report. Results of Operations Reportable segment We report our operating results and financial information in one operating and reportable segment. See Note 16 of our consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information. Comparison of 2019 to 2018 For information regarding the comparison of 2018 to 2017 , please refer to Part II Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC on February 20, 2019. Acquisitions During 2019 and 2018 , we acquired companies that provided us with strategic opportunities to expand our TAM and share of the philanthropic giving market through the integration of complementary solutions and services to serve the changing needs of our customers. The following are the companies we acquired and their respective acquisition dates: YourCause Holdings, LLC ("YourCause") January 2, 2019; and Reeher LLC ("Reeher") April 30, 2018 We have included the results of operations of acquired companies in our consolidated results of operations from the date of their respective acquisition. We determined that the YourCause and Reeher acquisitions were not material business combinations; therefore, revenue and earnings since the acquisition date and pro forma information are not required or presented. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for a summary of these acquisitions. 2019 Form 10-K 33 Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc. Revenue and Cost of Revenue Recurring Revenue ($M) Cost of revenue ($M) Gross profit ($M) and gross margin (%) YoY Growth (%) YoY Growth (%) Recurring revenue is comprised of fees for the use of our subscription-based software solutions, which includes providing access to cloud solutions, hosting services, online training programs, subscription-based analytic services, such as donor acquisitions and data enrichment, and payment services. Recurring revenue also includes fees from maintenance services for our on-premises solutions, services included in our renewable subscription contracts, subscription-based contracts for professional services and variable transaction revenue associated with the use of our solutions. Cost of recurring revenue is primarily comprised of compensation costs for customer support and production IT personnel, hosting expenses, third-party contractor expenses, third-party royalty and data expenses, allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs, amortization of intangible assets from business combinations, amortization of software development costs, transaction-based costs related to payments services including remittances of amounts due to third-parties and other costs incurred in providing support and recurring services to our customers. We continue to experience growth in sales of our cloud solutions as we meet the demand of our customers that increasingly prefer cloud subscription offerings with integrated analytics, training and payment services. Recurring subscription contracts are typically for a term of three years at contract inception with one to three-year renewals thereafter. We intend to continue focusing on innovation, quality and integration of our cloud solutions, which we believe will drive future revenue growth. Recurring revenue increased by $69.4 million , or 9.1% , driven primarily by the following: + Increase in subscriptions revenue of $87.8 million related to positive demand across our portfolio of cloud solutions and, to a lesser extent, the inclusion of YourCause, an increase in services embedded in our renewable cloud solution contracts and increased sales of subscription-based retained professional services - Decrease in maintenance revenue of $18.4 million primarily related to our continuing efforts to migrate customers from legacy on-premises solutions onto our solutions powered by Blackbaud SKY, our modern cloud platform Cost of recurring revenue increased by $52.5 million , or 17.2% , driven primarily by the following: + Increase in transaction-based costs of $13.0 million, related to payment services integrated in our cloud solutions + Increase in compensation costs of $11.2 million, primarily attributable to an increasing portion of our resources now providing subscription-based retained services as opposed to one-time + Increase in hosting and data center costs of $5.4 million as we are migrating our cloud infrastructure to leading public cloud service providers + Increase in third-party data and tool costs of $5.1 million 34 2019 Form 10-K Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc. + Increase in allocated corporate costs of $5.1 million primarily due to investments in corporate IT, including cyber security and increases in related headcount + Increase in amortization of software development costs of $4.1 million due to investments made on innovation, quality and the integration of our cloud solutions Recurring gross margin decreased by 3.0% , driven primarily by incremental costs associated with our continued shift toward selling cloud solutions and retained services, including hosting and data center costs, compensation costs and amortization of software development costs. We expect continued pressure on recurring gross margin largely driven by duplicate data center costs as we migrate our cloud infrastructure to leading public cloud service providers. One-time services and other Revenue ($M) Cost of revenue ($M) Gross profit ($M) and gross margin (%) YoY Growth (%) YoY Growth (%) One-time services and other revenue is comprised of fees for one-time consulting, analytic and onsite training services, as well as revenue from the sale of our software sold under perpetual license arrangements, fees from user conferences and third-party software referral fees. Cost of one-time services and other is primarily comprised of compensation costs for professional services and onsite training personnel, other costs incurred in providing onsite customer training, third-party contractor expenses, data expense incurred to perform one-time analytic services, third-party software royalties, costs of user conferences, allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs and amortization of intangible assets from business combinations. We expect that the shift in our go-to-market strategy towards cloud subscription offerings, which generally include integrated analytics, training and payment services, and require little to no customization services, will continue to negatively impact one-time services and other revenue. One-time services and other revenue decreased by $17.6 million , or 20.4% , driven primarily by the following: - Decrease in one-time consulting revenue of $12.6 million. Services are increasingly embedded in our renewable cloud solution contracts and we are selling more subscription-based contracts for retained professional services. Both our embedded services and retained services are recorded as recurring revenue. - Decrease in one-time analytics revenue of $3.8 million as analytics are generally integrated in our cloud solutions Cost of one-time services and other decreased by $15.8 million , or 20.8% , driven primarily by a decrease in compensation costs of $13.3 million . The decrease in compensation costs was in line with the decrease in one-time services sold and delivered as an increasing portion of our resources are now providing subscription-based retained services as opposed to one-time. One-time services and other gross margin increased by 0.4% , as the reductions in costs of one-time services and other discussed above slightly outpaced the declines in one-time consulting revenue and analytics revenue associated with the shift in our go-to-market strategy. 2019 Form 10-K 35 Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc. Operating Expenses Sales, marketing and customer success ($M) Research and development ($M) General and administrative ($M) Percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of total revenue Sales, marketing and customer success Sales, marketing and customer success expense includes compensation costs, variable sales commissions, travel-related expenses, advertising and marketing materials, public relations costs, variable reseller commissions and allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs. We see a large market opportunity and continue to make investments to improve market coverage and drive sales effectiveness, which is a component of our four-point growth strategy. We have also implemented software tools to enhance our digital footprint and drive lead generation. Sales, marketing and customer success expenses increased by $31.3 million , or 16.2% . The increases in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue were primarily driven by the following: + Increase in compensation costs of $21.2 million primarily associated with our efforts beginning in the second half of 2018 to increase our direct sales force as well as incremental headcount associated with the inclusion of YourCause. As a result, our direct sales headcount increased 8% during 2019. + Increases in allocated corporate costs of $7.0 million primarily driven by investments made in corporate IT, including cyber security and increases in related headcount + Increase in commission expense of $2.2 million primarily driven by an increase in commissionable sales Research and development Research and development expense includes compensation costs for engineering and product management personnel, third-party contractor expenses, software development tools and other expenses related to developing new solutions or upgrading and enhancing existing solutions that do not qualify for capitalization, and allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs. We continue to make investments to delight our customers with innovative cloud solutions, which is a component of our four-point growth strategy. Research and development expenses increased by $7.4 million , or 7.4% , primarily driven by the following: + Increase in compensation costs of $11.6 million primarily associated with the inclusion of YourCause's engineering resources + Increases in allocations of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs of $3.5 million primarily driven by investments made in corporate IT, including cyber security and increases in related headcount - Partially offset by an increase in software development costs of $9.5 million that were required to be capitalized under the internal-use software guidance see discussion below Not included in research and development expense for 2019 and 2018 were $46.0 million and $36.5 million , respectively, of qualifying costs associated with development activities that are required to be capitalized under the internal-use software 36 2019 Form 10-K Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc. accounting guidance such as those for our cloud solutions, as well as development costs associated with acquired companies. Qualifying capitalized software development costs associated with our cloud solutions are subsequently amortized to cost of subscriptions revenue over the related asset's estimated useful life, which generally range from three to seven years. We expect that the amount of software development costs capitalized will be relatively consistent in the near-term as we continue making investments in innovation, quality and the integration of our solutions, which we believe will drive long-term revenue growth. General and administrative General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation costs for general corporate functions, including senior management, finance, accounting, legal, human resources and corporate development, third-party professional fees, insurance, allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs, acquisition-related expenses and other administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $7.1 million , or 6.6% , primarily driven by the following: + Increase in compensation costs of $13.2 million primarily related to stock-based compensation and our acquisition of YourCause. The increase in stock-based compensation was primarily driven by increases in the grant date fair values of our annual equity awards granted to employees over the last three years as our headcount has grown. - Decrease in acquisition-related expenses and integration costs of $3.0 million Restructuring During 2017, in an effort to further our organizational objectives including, improved operating efficiency, customer outcomes and employee satisfaction, we initiated a multi-year plan to consolidate and relocate some of our existing offices to modern and more collaborative workspaces with short-term financial commitments. These workspaces are also more centrally located for our employees and closer to our customers and prospects. Restructuring costs incurred prior to our adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 consisted primarily of costs to terminate lease agreements, contractual lease payments, net of estimated sublease income, upon vacating space as part of the plan, as well as insignificant costs to relocate affected employees and write-off facilities-related fixed assets that we would no longer use. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 at January 1, 2019, we reduced our operating lease ROU assets recognized at transition by the carrying amounts of the restructuring liabilities for certain leased office spaces that we ceased using prior to December 31, 2018. See additional details below. Restructuring costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of operating lease ROU asset impairment costs and, to a lesser extent, lease payments for offices we have ceased using and write-offs of facilities-related fixed assets that we will no longer use. See Notes 11 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding these impairment costs and fixed asset write-offs. The following table summarizes our facilities optimization restructuring costs as of December 31, 2019 : Cumulative costs incurred as of Costs incurred during the year ended (1) Cumulative costs incurred as of (in thousands) December 31, 2018 December 31, 2019 By component: Contract termination costs $ 4,176 $ 4,906 $ 9,082 Other costs 1,208 902 2,110 Total $ 5,384 $ 5,808 $ 11,192 (1) Includes $3.8 million of operating lease ROU asset impairment costs. As of December 31, 2019 , we have substantially completed our facilities optimization restructuring plan. Any remaining restructuring costs related to these activities are expected to be insignificant. The cumulative costs incurred as of December 31, 2019 of $11.2 million exceeded the estimated range previously disclosed of between $8.5 million and $9.5 million. Based on our updated estimates during the fourth quarter about our inability to sublease certain office spaces we had previously ceased using, we recorded incremental operating lease ROU asset impairment costs as discussed above. These 2019 Form 10-K 37 Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc. restructuring activities are expected to result in improved operating efficiencies and future annual before-tax savings of between $5.0 million and $6.0 million beginning in 2020. The change in our liability related to our facilities optimization restructuring during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 , consisted of the following: Accrued at Increases for incurred costs (1) Written off upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 (2) Costs paid Accrued at (in thousands) December 31, 2018 December 31, 2019 By component: Contract termination costs $ 1,865 $ 4,906 $ (1,656 ) $ (5,115 ) $ Other costs 50 902 (952 ) Total $ 1,915 $ 5,808 $ (1,656 ) $ (6,067 ) $ (1) Includes $3.8 million of operating lease ROU asset impairment costs. (2) Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 at January 1, 2019, we reduced our operating lease ROU assets recognized at transition by the carrying amounts of the restructuring liabilities for certain leased office spaces that we ceased using prior to December 31, 2018. Interest expense Years ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Change Interest expense $ 20.6 $ 15.9 29.7 % % of total revenue 2.3 % 1.9 % Interest expense increased during 2019 , when compared to 2018 , primarily due to an increase in our average daily borrowings related to our acquisition of YourCause in January 2019. Deferred revenue The table below compares the components of deferred revenue from our consolidated balance sheets: (dollars in millions) Timing of recognition December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Change Recurring Over the period billed in advance, generally one year $ 302.8 $ 287.0 5.5 % One-time services and other As services are delivered 13.4 11.6 15.4 % Total deferred revenue (1) 316.1 298.6 5.9 % Less: Long-term portion 1.8 2.6 (29.7 )% Current portion (1) $ 314.3 $ 296.0 6.2 % (1) The individual amounts for each year may not sum to total deferred revenue or current portion of deferred revenue due to rounding. To the extent that our customers are billed for our solutions and services in advance of delivery, we record such amounts in deferred revenue. Our recurring revenue contracts are generally for a term of three years at contract inception with one to three-year renewals thereafter, billed annually in advance and non-cancelable. We generally invoice our customers with recurring revenue contracts in annual cycles 30 days prior to the end of the contract term. Deferred revenue from recurring revenue contracts increased during 2019 , primarily due to new subscription sales of our cloud solutions. Our acquisition of YourCause on January 2, 2019 also modestly contributed to the increase in recurring deferred revenue since December 31, 2018. We also sold more subscription-based contracts for retained professional services. We have acquired businesses whose net tangible assets include deferred revenue. In accordance with GAAP reporting requirements, we recorded write-downs of deferred revenue from customer arrangements predating the acquisition to fair value, which resulted in lower recorded deferred revenue as of the acquisition date than the actual amounts paid in advance for solutions and services under those customer arrangements. Therefore, our deferred revenue after an acquisition 2019 Form 10-K 38 Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc. will not reflect the full amount of deferred revenue that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value. Further explanation of this impact is included below under the caption "Non-GAAP financial measures". Income tax benefit Our income tax benefit and effective income tax rates, including the effects of period-specific events, were: Years ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Income tax benefit $ (1.3 ) $ (0.2 ) Effective income tax rate (12.5 )% (0.5 )% Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate quarterly as a result of factors, including changes in tax law in jurisdictions where we conduct business, transactions entered into, changes in the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses, and our assessment of certain tax contingencies and valuation allowances. We have deferred tax assets for federal, state, and international net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various Internal Revenue Code limitations and applicable state tax laws. A portion of the foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards and a portion of state tax credits have a valuation reserve due to the uncertainty of realizing such carryforwards and credits in the future. We file income tax returns in the U.S. for federal and various state jurisdictions as well as in foreign jurisdictions including Canada, the U.K., Australia, Ireland and Costa Rica. We are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax examination for calendar tax years ending 2016 through 2019, as well as state and foreign income tax examinations for various years depending on statute of limitations of those jurisdictions. We have taken federal and state tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease within the next twelve months. The possible decrease could result from the expiration of statutes of limitations. The reasonably possible decrease at December 31, 2019 was $1.4 million . We recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2019, when compared to 2018, was primarily due to the heightened impact of research credit generation net of Section 162(m) nondeductible compensation. Furthermore, the 2019 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by other state tax credits net of an overall increase to uncertain tax positions. Lastly, the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by Global Intangible Low-Tax Income ("GILTI"), net of Foreign-Derived Intangible Income ("FDII") benefit, resulting from an increase in non-US earnings. The reduced base further magnified the impact of other nondeductible items. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefit that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate, was $3.9 million and $3.3 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. Non-GAAP financial measures The operating results analyzed below are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We use non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share internally in analyzing our operational performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. While we believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies. 2019 Form 10-K 39 Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc. We have acquired businesses whose net tangible assets include deferred revenue. In accordance with GAAP reporting requirements, we recorded write-downs of deferred revenue under arrangements predating the acquisition to fair value, which resulted in lower recognized revenue than the contributed purchase price until the related obligations to provide services under such arrangements are fulfilled. Therefore, our GAAP revenues after the acquisitions will not reflect the full amount of revenue that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value. The non-GAAP measures described below reverse the acquisition-related deferred revenue write-downs so that the full amount of revenue booked by the acquired companies is included, which we believe provides a more accurate representation of a revenue run-rate in a given period and, therefore, will provide more meaningful comparative results in future periods. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed below exclude the impact of certain transactions because we believe they are not directly related to our operating performance in any particular period, but are for our long-term benefit over multiple periods. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business.

Non-GAAP organic revenue growth In addition, we use non-GAAP organic revenue growth, non-GAAP organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis and non-GAAP organic recurring revenue growth, in analyzing our operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, for evaluating the periodic growth of our business on a consistent basis. Each of these measures of non-GAAP organic revenue growth excludes incremental acquisition-related revenue attributable to companies acquired in the current fiscal year. For companies, if any, acquired in the immediately preceding fiscal year, each of these non-GAAP organic revenue growth measures reflects presentation of full year incremental non-GAAP revenue derived from such companies as if they were combined throughout the prior period, and they include the non-GAAP revenue attributable to those companies, as if there were no acquisition-related write-downs of acquired deferred revenue to fair value as required by GAAP. In addition, each of these non-GAAP organic revenue growth measures excludes prior period revenue associated with divested businesses. The exclusion of the prior period revenue is to present the results of the divested businesses within the results of the combined company for the same period of time in both the prior and current periods. We believe this presentation provides a more comparable representation of its current business organic revenue growth and revenue run-rate.

For companies acquired in the immediately preceding fiscal year, non-GAAP acquisition-related revenue reflects presentation of full-year incremental non-GAAP revenue derived from such companies, as if they were combined throughout the prior period, and it includes the current period non-GAAP revenue from the acquisition-related deferred revenue write-down attributable to those companies. (2) Non-GAAP organic revenue for the prior year periods presented herein will not agree to non-GAAP organic revenue presented in the respective prior period quarterly financial information solely due to the manner in which non-GAAP organic revenue growth is calculated. (3) To determine non-GAAP organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis, revenues from entities reporting in foreign currencies were translated to U.S. Dollars using the comparable prior period's quarterly weighted average foreign currency exchange rates. The primary foreign currencies creating the impact are the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Canadian Dollar and EURO. Seasonality Our revenues normally fluctuate as a result of certain seasonal variations in our business. Our transaction revenue has historically been at its lowest in the first quarter due to the timing of customer fundraising initiatives and events. Our revenue from payment services has historically increased during the fourth quarter due to year-end giving. Our revenue from professional services has historically been lower in the first quarter when many of those services commence and in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season. As a result of these and other factors, our total revenue has historically been lower in the first quarter than in the remainder of our fiscal year, with the fourth quarter historically achieving the highest total revenue. Our expenses, however, do not vary significantly as a result of these factors, but do fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to varying timing of expenditures. Our cash flow from operations normally fluctuates quarterly due to the combination of the timing of customer contract renewals including renewals associated with customers of acquired companies, delivery of professional services and occurrence of customer events, the payment of bonuses, as well as merit-based salary increases, among other factors. Historically, due to lower revenues in our first quarter, combined with the payment of bonuses from the prior year in our first quarter and the payment of certain annual vendor contracts, our cash flow from operations has been lowest in our first quarter. Due to the timing of customer contract renewals and student enrollments, many of which take place at or near the beginning of our third quarter, our cash flow from operations has been lower in our second quarter as compared to our third and fourth quarters. Partially offsetting these favorable drivers 42 2019 Form 10-K Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc. of cash flow from operations in our third and fourth quarters are merit-based salary increases, which are generally effective in April each year. In addition, deferred revenues can vary on a seasonal basis for the same reasons. These patterns may change as a result of the continued shift to online giving, growth in volume of transactions for which we process payments, or as a result of acquisitions, new market opportunities, new solution introductions or other factors. Our cash flow from financing is negatively impacted in our first quarter when most of our equity awards vest, as we pay taxes on behalf of our employees related to the settlement or exercise of equity awards. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents selected financial information about our financial position: (dollars in millions) December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 31.8 $ 30.9 3.1 % Property and equipment, net 35.5 40.0 (11.2 )% Software development costs, net 101.3 75.1 34.9 % Total carrying value of debt 467.1 387.1 20.7 % Working capital (254.3 ) (207.7 ) (22.5 )% The following table presents selected financial information about our cash flows: Years ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2019 2018 Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 182.5 $ 201.4 (9.4 )% Net cash used in investing activities (167.2 ) (97.8 ) 71.0 % Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 111.2 (291.9 ) (138.1 )% Our principal sources of liquidity are operating cash flow, funds available under the 2017 Credit Facility and cash on hand. Our operating cash flow depends on continued customer renewal of our subscription and maintenance arrangements and market acceptance of our solutions and services. Based on current estimates of revenue and expenses, we believe that the currently available sources of funds and anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate for at least the next twelve months to finance our operations, fund anticipated capital expenditures, meet our debt obligations and pay dividends. Dividend payments are not guaranteed and our Board of Directors may decide, in its absolute discretion, at any time and for any reason, not to declare and pay further dividends and/or repurchase our common stock. To the extent we undertake future material acquisitions, investments or unanticipated capital expenditures, we may require additional capital. In that context, we regularly evaluate opportunities to enhance our capital structure including through potential debt or equity issuances. At December 31, 2019 , our total cash and cash equivalents balance included approximately $15.9 million of cash that was held outside the U.S. While these funds may not be needed to fund our U.S. operations for at least the next twelve months, if we need these funds, we may be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate a portion of the funds. We currently do not intend or anticipate a need to repatriate our cash held outside the U.S. Operating Cash Flow Throughout 2019 and 2018 , our cash flows from operations were derived principally from: (i) our earnings from on-going operations prior to non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount and adjustments to our provision for sales returns and allowances; and (ii) changes in our working capital. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $18.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 , when compared to the same period in 2018 , primarily due to a $10.8 million decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash expenses, and a decrease in cash flow from operations associated with working capital. 2019 Form 10-K 43 Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc. Working capital changes are composed of changes in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities and deferred revenue. Cash flow from operations associated with working capital decreased $8.1 million during 2019 , when compared to 2018 , primarily due to: an increase in the amount of deferred revenue recognized slightly outpacing customer billings; an increase in collection of customer account balances in 2018 from an aging improvement initiative; and an income tax refund received in 2018 which did not recur in 2019; partially offset by an increase in accrued bonuses as of December 31, 2019 when compared the same date in 2018; and fluctuations in the timing of vendor payments. During 2020 , we expect our total operating cash flow to decrease when compared to 2019 , primarily due to the cash payout of higher 2019 accrued bonuses, a modest increase in cash payments for income taxes and the timing of vendor payments. Investing Cash Flow Net cash used in investing activities of $167.2 million increased by $69.4 million during 2019 , when compared to 2018 . During 2019 , we used net cash of $109.4 million , for our acquisition of YourCause, while we spent $44.9 million on investments in acquired companies in 2018 . We used $46.9 million for software development costs, which was up $9.2 million from cash spent during 2018 . The increase in cash outlays for software development costs was primarily related to our innovative cloud solutions as well as development activities for Blackbaud SKY, our modern cloud platform. We also spent $11.5 million of cash for purchases of property and equipment during 2019 , which was down $3.2 million from cash spent in 2018 . The higher cash outlays for property and equipment during 2018 was primarily driven by leasehold improvements for our New Headquarters Facility in Charleston, South Carolina. During 2020 , we expect our total capital expenditures to increase when compared to 2019 , which includes purchases of property and equipment and estimated cash outlays for capitalized software development costs. Refer to the commitments and contingencies subsection below for future minimum commitments related to purchase obligations. Financing Cash Flow During 2019 , we had a net increase in borrowings of $79.5 million , which was primarily attributable to our acquisition of YourCause, compared to a net decrease in borrowings of $51.6 million in 2018 . We paid $23.8 million to satisfy tax obligations of employees upon settlement or exercise of equity awards during 2019 compared to $27.7 million during 2018 . The amount of taxes paid by us on the behalf of employees related to the settlement or exercise of equity awards varies from period to period based upon the timing of grants and vesting, employee exercise decisions, as well as the market price for shares of our common stock at the time of settlement. Most of our equity awards currently vest in our first quarter. In addition, during 2019 , we paid dividends of $23.6 million , which was relatively consistent with 2018 . Cash flow from financing activities associated with changes in restricted cash due to customers increased $266.3 million during 2019 , when compared to 2018 . The amount of restricted cash held and payable by us to customers as of December 31, 2017 was significantly larger than at the same date in 2018 primarily due to the timing of year-end donations. 2017 Credit Facility In June 2017 , we entered into a five -year $700.0 million senior credit facility (the " 2017 Credit Facility ). Upon closing, we drew $300.0 million on a term loan and $110.0 million in revolving credit loans, which was used to repay all amounts outstanding under our previous credit facility and for other general corporate purposes. 44 2019 Form 10-K Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc. We have drawn on our credit facility from time to time to help us meet financial needs, such as financing for business acquisitions. At December 31, 2019 , our available borrowing capacity under the 2017 Credit Facility was $209.6 million . The 2017 Credit Facility matures in June 2022 . At December 31, 2019 , the carrying amount of our debt under the 2017 Credit Facility was $467.1 million . Our average daily borrowings were $537.3 million during 2019 . Following is a summary of the financial covenants under our credit facility: Financial Covenant Requirement Ratio as of December 31, 2019 Net Leverage Ratio 3.50 to 1.00 2.30 to 1.00 Interest Coverage Ratio 2.50 to 1.00 9.27 to 1.00 Under the 2017 Credit Facility , we also have restrictions on our ability to declare and pay dividends and our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. In order to pay any cash dividends and/or repurchase shares of stock: (i) no default or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing under the 2017 Credit Facility , and (ii) our pro forma net leverage ratio, as set forth in the 2017 Credit Facility , must be 0.25 less than the net leverage ratio requirement at the time of dividend declaration or share repurchase. At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with our debt covenants under the 2017 Credit Facility. YourCause Acquisition In January 2019, we acquired YourCause for $157.7 million in cash, net of closing adjustments. On January 2, 2019 , we drew down a revolving credit loan under the 2017 Credit Facility to finance the acquisition. 2019 Form 10-K 45 Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc. Commitments and Contingencies As of December 31, 2019 , we had contractual obligations with future minimum commitments as follows: Payments due by period (in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Recorded contractual obligations: Debt (1) $ 468.3 $ 7.5 $ 460.8 $ $ Operating leases (2) 161.6 26.0 39.0 22.4 74.2 Interest payments on debt (3) 1.8 1.0 0.7 Unrecorded contractual obligations: Purchase obligations (4) 91.7 41.6 49.2 0.8 Interest payments on debt (5) 33.7 14.0 19.7 Debt (6) 2.2 0.5 1.1 0.5 Total contractual obligations $ 759.1 $ 90.7 $ 570.5 $ 23.8 $ 74.2 (1) Represents principal payments only, under the following assumptions: (i) that the amounts outstanding under the 2017 Credit Facility at December 31, 2019 will remain outstanding until maturity, with minimum payments occurring as currently scheduled, and (ii) that there are no assumed future borrowings on the 2017 Revolving Facility for the purposes of determining minimum commitment amounts. (2) Our commitments related to operating leases have not been reduced by sublease income, incentive payments, reimbursement of leasehold improvements and the amount representing imputed interest of $46.2 million . (3) Represents interest payment obligations related to our interest rate swap agreements. (4) We have contractual obligations for third-party technology used in our solutions and for other services we purchase as part of our normal operations. In certain cases, these arrangements require a minimum annual purchase commitment by us. (5) The actual interest expense recognized in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income will depend on the amount of debt, the length of time the debt is outstanding and the interest rate, which could be different from our assumptions described in (1) above. (6) Represents principal payments only for our other debt as described in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. The term loan under the 2017 Credit Facility and our other debt require periodic principal payments. The balance of the term loans and any amounts drawn on the revolving credit loans are due upon maturity of the 2017 Credit Facility in June 2022 . The total liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , was $4.3 million and $3.7 million , respectively. Our accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns was $1.0 million and $0.7 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. In February 2020 , our Board of Directors approved our annual dividend rate of $0.48 per share to be made in quarterly payments. Dividends at this annual rate would aggregate to $24.0 million assuming 50.0 million shares of common stock are outstanding, although dividends are not guaranteed and our Board of Directors may decide, in its absolute discretion, to change or suspend dividend payments at any time for any reason. Our ability to continue to declare and pay dividends quarterly this year and beyond might be restricted by, among other things, the terms of the 2017 Credit Facility , general economic conditions and our ability to generate adequate operating cash flow. On February 10, 2020 , our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.12 per share payable on March 13, 2020 to stockholders of record on February 28, 2020 . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2019 , we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 46 2019 Form 10-K Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Approximately 14% of our total revenue for 2019 was generated by operations outside the U.S. We do not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary. Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and, accordingly, changes in the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect the translation of our subsidiaries financial results into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results. The accumulated currency translation adjustment, recorded within other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders equity, was a loss of $4.0 million and $6.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. The vast majority of our contracts are entered into by our U.S. or U.K. entities. The contracts entered into by the U.S. entity are almost always denominated in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars, and contracts entered into by our U.K., Australian and Irish subsidiaries are generally denominated in British Pounds, Australian dollars and Euros, respectively. Historically, as the U.S. dollar weakened, foreign currency translation resulted in an increase in our revenues and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies. Conversely, as the U.S. dollar strengthened, foreign currency translation resulted in a decrease in our revenues and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies. During 2019 , foreign translation resulted in a decrease in our revenues and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies. Though we have exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the impact has generally not been material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position. During 2019 , the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates reduced our total revenue by $5.8 million and our income from operations by $1.3 million . We will continue monitoring such exposure and take action as appropriate. To determine the impacts on revenue (or income from operations) from fluctuations in currency exchange rates, current period revenues (or income from operations) from entities reporting in foreign currencies were translated into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period's weighted average foreign currency exchange rates. These impacts are non-GAAP financial information and are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Inflation We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if inflationary pressures impact the rate of giving to our customers, there could be adverse impacts to our business, financial condition and results of operations. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could materially differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements in this report. We believe the accounting estimates listed below are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 2019 Form 10-K 47 Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc. Revenue Recognition Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies. Revenues are recognized when control of our services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; (2) Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determination of the transaction price; (4) Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, and to apply judgment. For example, for arrangements that have multiple performance obligations, we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to (1) determine whether performance obligations are distinct and should be accounted for separately; (2) determine the standalone selling price of each performance obligation; (3) allocate the transaction price among the various performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis; and (4) determine whether revenue for each performance obligation should be recognized at a point in time or over time. In addition, we exercise judgment in certain transactions when determining whether we should recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer (as a principal) or the net amount retained (as an agent). These judgments are based on our determination of whether or not we control the service before it is transferred to the customer. If we were to change any of these judgments or estimates, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue or deferred revenue that we report in a particular period. Costs of Obtaining Contracts Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions We pay sales commissions at the time contracts with customers are signed or shortly thereafter, depending on the size and duration of the sales contract. Sales commissions and related fringe benefits earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs are deferred and then amortized in a manner that aligns with the expected period of benefit, which we have determined to be five years. We do not generally pay commissions for contract renewals. The related amortization expense is included in sales, marketing and customer success expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Our accounting methodology for determining the period over which we amortize costs of obtaining contracts with customers contains uncertainties because it requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, and to apply judgment. For example, we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to determine the expected period of benefit of our sales commissions. We take into consideration our customer contracts, including renewals, retention, our technology and other factors. If we were to change any of these judgments or estimates, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of assets, operating expenses or income that we report in a particular period. 48 2019 Form 10-K Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc. Business Combinations Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of long-lived and identifiable intangible assets, and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the closing date. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to long-lived and intangible assets. Management estimates the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimates about: expected future cash flows from customers, including revenue and operating expenses; royalty and customer attrition rates; proprietary technology obsolescence curve; the acquired company's brand awareness and market position; the market awareness of the acquired company's branded technology solutions and services; assumptions about the period of time the brands will continue to be valuable; as well as expected costs to develop any in-process research and development into commercially viable solutions and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed, and discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. If actual results are materially different than the assumptions we used to determine fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed through a business combination as well as the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets, it is possible that adjustments to the carrying values of such assets and liabilities will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for information regarding our business acquisitions. Income Taxes Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions We make estimates and judgments in accounting for income taxes. Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. We measure and recognize uncertain tax positions. To recognize uncertain tax positions, we must first determine if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit. We must then measure the benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We make estimates in determining tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The calculation of our income tax provision requires estimates due to transactions, credits and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Uncertainties arise as a consequence of the actual source of taxable income between domestic and foreign locations, the outcome of tax audits and the ultimate utilization of tax credits. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses, changes in tax law in jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in the identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. In assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance significant judgment is required. We consider all positive and negative evidence and a variety of factors including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, historical and projected future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent actual results differ from estimated amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which the determination is made. If we determine there is less than a 50% likelihood that we will be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value, then an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is made to increase income tax expense, thereby reducing net income in the period such determination was made. 2019 Form 10-K 49 Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc. Long-lived Assets and Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions We review our long-lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances occur, we use the undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether our long-lived and intangible assets other than goodwill are impaired. To the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining life of the asset, we measure the impairment using discounted cash flows. When measuring impairment of an asset using discounted cash flows, we make assumptions and apply judgment in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including annual revenue growth rates, a terminal year growth rate and selecting a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the year ended December 31, 2019. During 2019, we recorded impairment charges against a finite-lived intangible asset, certain property and equipment assets and certain operating lease ROU assets. For additional information, see Notes 4, 7 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements in this report. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to assess impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of the impact that recently issued accounting pronouncements are expected to have on our financial position and results of operations when adopted in the future, see Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements in this report. 50 2019 Form 10-K Table of Contents Blackbaud, Inc.
