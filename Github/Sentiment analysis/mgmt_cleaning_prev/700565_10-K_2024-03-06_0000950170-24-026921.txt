For the Years Ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 Overview This overview of management discussion and analysis highlights selected information in this document and may not contain all the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources, and critical accounting estimates, you should carefully read this entire document. These have an impact on the Company consolidated financial condition and results of consolidated operations. Net income was $68.9 million, $73.0 million, and $51.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $3.15, $3.60, and $2.87 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The following table shows the Company annualized performance ratios for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021: 2023 2022 2021 Return on average assets 0.97 % 1.11 % 0.90 % Return on average common equity 10.10 % 11.38 % 8.38 % Average common equity to average assets (non-GAAP) 9.61 % 9.77 % 10.72 % Total assets at December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were $7.59 billion, $6.74 billion, and $5.99 billion, respectively. Net loan balances increased to $5.51 billion at December 31, 2023, from $4.77 billion at December 31, 2022, and from $3.94 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to approximately $730.2 million of gross loans acquired, after purchase accounting adjustments, from Blackhawk Bank. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to approximately $418.5 17 million of loans acquired from Jefferson Bank. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to approximately $829 million of loans acquired from Providence Bank and $208 million of loans purchased from Stifel Bank. Total deposit balances increased to $6.12 billion at December 31, 2023 from $5.26 billion at December 31, 2022 and from $4.96 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to $1.19 billion acquired from Blackhawk Bank. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to $560 million of deposits acquired from Jefferson Bank. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to $990 million of deposits acquired from Providence Bank and $219 million of deposits acquired in association with loans purchased from Stifel Bank. Net interest margin (tax effected), defined as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets, was 3.05% for 2023, 3.13% for 2022 and 3.21% for 2021. The decrease in 2022 and 2023 was primarily due to an increase in rates on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. Net interest income increased to $193.5 million in 2023 from $184.3 million in 2022 and $167.8 million in 2021. During 2023, the increase in net interest income was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. During 2022, the increase in net interest income was primarily due to the acquisition of Jefferson Bank. Non-interest income increased to $86.8 million in 2023 compared to $74.7 million in 2022 and $69.8 million in 2021. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank and an increase in insurance revenues. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to growth in wealth management and insurance revenues and the acquisition of Jefferson Bank. Non-interest expenses increased to $185.7 million in 2023 compared to $162.9 million in 2022, and $155.6 million in 2021. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank and nonrecurring costs tied to the acquisition and integration. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to the acquisition of Jefferson Bank. Following is a summary of the factors that contributed to the changes in net income (in thousands): 2023 vs 2022 2022 vs 2021 Net interest income $ 9,186 $ 16,526 Provision for credit losses (1,298 ) 10,345 Other income, including securities transactions 12,104 4,915 Other expenses (22,879 ) (7,282 ) Income taxes (1,130 ) (3,042 ) Increase (decrease) in net income $ (4,017 ) $ 21,462 Credit quality is an area of importance to the Company. Year-end total nonperforming loans were $20.1 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $19.2 million at December 31, 2022, and $22.0 million at December 31, 2021. Repossessed Assets balances totaled $1.2 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $4.4 million at December 31, 2022, and $5.0 million at December 31, 2021. The Company provision for credit losses was $6.1 million for 2023, compared to $4.8 million for 2022, and $15.2 million for 2021. The increase in provision expense for 2023 was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. The decrease of provision expense in 2022 was primarily due to the provision requirements in 2021 for the acquisition of Providence Bank. The Company capital position remains strong and the Company has consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios above the well-capitalized standards. The Company Tier 1 capital ratio to risk weighted assets ratio at December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was 12.02%, 12.40%, and 12.51%, respectively. The Company total capital to risk weighted assets ratio at December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was 14.84%, 15.20% and 15.79%, respectively. The decrease in 2023 was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to the acquisition of Jefferson Bank. The Company liquidity position remains sufficient to fund operations and meet the requirements of borrowers, depositors, and creditors. The Company maintains various sources of liquidity to fund its cash needs. See Liquidity herein for a full listing of its sources and anticipated significant contractual obligations. The Company enters into financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include lines of credit, letters of credit and other commitments to extend credit. The total outstanding commitments at December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion, and $1.0 billion, respectively. See Note 17 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities herein for further information. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates The Company has established various accounting policies that govern the application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in the preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements. The significant accounting policies of the Company are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities; management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from these judgments and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the Company. Investment in Debt and Equity Securities. The Company classifies its investments in debt securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are recorded at amortized cost. Available-for-sale and equity securities are carried at fair value. Fair value calculations are based on quoted market prices when such prices are available. If quoted market prices are not available, estimates of fair value are computed using a variety of techniques, including extrapolation from the quoted prices of similar instruments or recent trades for thinly traded securities, fundamental analysis, or through obtaining purchase quotes. Due to the subjective nature of the valuation process, it is possible that the actual fair values of these investments could differ from the estimated amounts, thereby affecting the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. If the estimated value of investments is less than the cost or amortized 18 cost, the Company evaluates whether an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. If such an event or change has occurred and the Company determines that the impairment is other-than-temporary, a further determination is made as to the portion of impairment that is related to credit loss. The impairment of the investment that is related to the credit loss is expensed in the period in which the event or change occurred. The remainder of the impairment is recorded in other comprehensive income. Allowance for Credit Losses - Held-to-Maturity Securities. Currently all the Company's held-to-maturity securities are government agency-backed securities for which the risk of loss is minimal. Accordingly, the Company does not record an allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities. Loans. Loans are reported at amortized cost. Amortized cost is the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase discounts and premiums, fair value hedge accounting adjustments and deferred loan fees and costs. Accrued interest is reported separately and is included in interest receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans. The Company believes the allowance for credit losses for loans is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. The allowance for credit losses for loans represents the best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. An estimate of potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio are determined and an allowance for those losses is established by considering factors including historical loss rates, expected cash flows and estimated collateral values. In assessing these factors, the Company uses relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis for non-impaired loans with similar risk characteristics. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimate of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for relevant factors to each pool including merger & acquisition activity, economic conditions, changes in policies, procedures & underwriting, and concentrations. The Company estimates the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses for impaired loans by evaluating them separately. A specific allowance is assigned to an impaired loan when expected cash flows or collateral are less than the carrying amount of the loan. Allowance for Credit Losses - Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period that the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Other Real Estate Owned. Other real estate owned acquired through loan foreclosure is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. The adjustment at the time of foreclosure is recorded through the allowance for credit losses. Due to the subjective nature of establishing the fair value when the asset is acquired, the actual fair value of the other real estate owned or foreclosed asset could differ from the original estimate. If it is determined that fair value temporarily declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through noninterest expense. Operating costs associated with the assets after acquisition are also recorded as noninterest expense. Gains and losses on the disposition of other real estate owned and foreclosed assets are netted and posted to other noninterest expense. Mortgage Servicing Rights. The Company has elected to measure mortgage servicing rights under the amortization method. Using this method, servicing rights are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income. The amortized assets are assessed for impairment based on fair value at each reporting date. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into tranches based on predominant characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation reserve, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount of servicing assets. Fair value in excess of the carrying amount of servicing assets is not recognized. Deferred Income Tax Assets/Liabilities. The Company net deferred income tax asset arises from differences in the dates that items of income and expense enter into our reported income and taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for these items as they arise. From an accounting standpoint, deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they are realizable based on the historical level of taxable income, estimates of future taxable income and the reversals of deferred tax liabilities. In most cases, the realization of the deferred tax asset is based on future profitability. If the Company were to experience net operating losses for tax purposes in a future period, the realization of deferred tax assets would be evaluated for a potential valuation reserve. Additionally, the Company reviews its uncertain tax positions annually. An uncertain tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is "more likely than not" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be recognized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the "more likely than not" test, no tax benefit is recorded. A significant amount of judgment is applied to determine both whether the tax position meets the "more likely than not" test as well as to determine the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be recognized. Differences between the position taken by management and that of taxing authorities could result in a reduction of a tax benefit or increase to tax liability, which could adversely affect future income tax expense. Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Core deposit and customer relationships, which are intangible assets with a finite life, are recorded on the Company consolidated balance sheets. These intangible assets were capitalized as a result of past acquisitions and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of up to 15 years. Core deposit intangible assets, with finite lives will be tested for impairment when changes in events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Core deposit intangible assets were tested for impairment during 2023 as part of the goodwill impairment test and no impairment was deemed necessary. As a result of the Company acquisition activity, goodwill, an intangible asset with an indefinite life, is reflected on the balance sheets. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually, unless there are factors present that indicate a potential impairment, in which case, the goodwill impairment test is performed more frequently than annually. 19 Fair Value Measurements. The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The Company estimates the fair value of a financial instrument using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, the Company estimates fair value. The Company valuation methods consider factors such as liquidity and concentration concerns. Other factors such as model assumptions, market dislocations, and unexpected correlations can affect estimates of fair value. Imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded. ASC 820 establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of financial instruments that considers the attributes specific to particular assets or liabilities and establishes a three-level hierarchy for determining fair value based on the transparency of inputs to each valuation as of the fair value measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: Level 1 quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices of identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. At the end of each quarter, the Company assesses the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured. From time to time, assets or liabilities may be transferred within hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date. Transfers into or out of hierarchy levels are based upon the fair value at the beginning of the reporting period. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy can be found in Note 11 Disclosures of Fair Values of Financial Instruments. Results of Operations Net Interest Income The largest source of operating revenue for the Company is net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between total interest income earned on earning assets and total interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The amount of interest income is dependent upon many factors, including the volume and mix of earning assets, the general level of interest rates and the dynamics of changes in interest rates. The cost of funds necessary to support earning assets varies with the volume and mix of interest-bearing liabilities and the rates paid to attract and retain such funds. Net interest income is the excess of interest received from earning assets over interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. For analytical purposes, net interest income is presented on a full tax equivalent (TE) basis in the table that follows. The federal statutory rate in effect of 21% was used for all years. The TE analysis portrays the income tax benefits associated with the tax-exempt assets. The year-to-date net yield on interest-earning assets excluding the TE adjustments of $3,060,000, $3,164,000, and $2,624,000 for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, were 3.00%, 3.08%, and 3.17% at December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The 20 Company average balances, fully tax equivalent interest income and interest expense, and rates earned or paid for major balance sheet categories are set forth in the following table (dollars in thousands): Year Ended Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Average Average Average Average Average Average Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Assets Interest-bearing deposits $ 82,640 $ 5,107 6.18 % $ 56,517 $ 492 0.87 % $ 268,523 $ 357 0.13 % Federal funds sold 8,299 419 5.05 % 5,772 113 1.96 % 1,335 0.03 % Certificates of deposit investments 1,822 98 5.37 % 1,756 37 2.10 % 2,606 56 2.13 % Investment securities Taxable 964,898 24,307 2.52 % 1,053,511 20,595 1.95 % 923,600 15,598 1.69 % Tax-exempt (Municipals)(TE)(1) 276,417 9,889 3.58 % 328,832 11,121 3.38 % 299,833 9,264 3.09 % Loans (TE)(1)(2)(3) 5,079,949 263,406 5.19 % 4,518,566 186,697 4.13 % 3,778,174 160,362 4.24 % Total earning assets 6,414,025 303,226 4.73 % 5,964,954 219,055 3.67 % 5,274,071 185,637 3.51 % Cash and due from banks 133,237 123,306 95,902 Premises and equipment 94,897 88,744 79,913 Other assets 520,944 439,545 333,115 Allowance for credit losses (62,878 ) (58,876 ) (53,188 ) Total assets $ 7,100,225 $ 6,557,673 $ 5,729,813 Liabilities and stockholders' equity Deposits: Demand deposits, interest-bearing $ 2,618,452 47,939 1.83 % $ 2,598,480 13,709 0.53 % $ 2,217,281 4,258 0.19 % Savings deposits 663,760 739 0.11 % 666,334 570 0.09 % 611,379 487 0.08 % Time deposits 961,162 28,616 2.98 % 655,240 4,534 0.69 % 671,056 4,292 0.64 % Total interest-bearing deposits 4,243,374 77,294 1.82 % 3,920,054 18,813 0.48 % 3,499,716 9,037 0.26 % Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 225,307 6,565 2.91 % 202,242 1,795 0.89 % 173,762 231 0.13 % FHLB advances 462,197 16,779 3.63 % 276,401 6,184 2.24 % 107,518 1,514 1.41 % Federal funds purchased 192 10 5.21 % 481 9 2 % Subordinated debt 99,638 4,196 4.18 % 94,471 3,945 4.18 % 94,321 3,939 4.18 % Junior subordinated debentures 21,337 1,859 8.87 % 19,275 868 4.50 % 19,105 541 2.83 % Other debt % 14 % % Total borrowings 808,671 29,409 3.64 % 592,884 12,801 2.16 % 394,706 6,225 1.58 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 5,052,045 106,703 2.11 % 4,512,938 31,614 0.70 % 3,894,422 15,262 0.39 % Demand deposits 1,312,023 1,356,912 1,164,877 Other liabilities 53,838 46,811 56,388 Stockholders equity 682,319 641,012 614,126 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 7,100,225 $ 6,557,673 $ 5,729,813 Net interest income $ 196,523 $ 187,441 $ 170,375 Net interest spread 2.62 % 2.97 % 3.12 % Impact of non-interest-bearing funds 0.43 % 0.16 % 0.09 % TE net yield on interest-earning assets 3.05 % 3.13 % 3.21 % (1) Tax-exempt income is shown on a fully tax equivalent basis.

The following table summarizes the approximate relative contribution of changes in average volume and interest rates to changes in net interest income for the past two years (in thousands): 2023 Compared to 2022 2022 Compared to 2021 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) Total Total Change Volume (1) Rate (1) Change Volume (1) Rate (1) Earning assets: Interest-bearing deposits $ 4,615 $ 325 $ 4,290 $ 135 $ (468 ) $ 603 Federal funds sold 306 67 239 113 4 109 Certificates of deposit investments 61 1 60 (19 ) (18 ) (1 ) Investment securities: Taxable 3,712 (1,854 ) 5,566 4,997 2,387 2,610 Tax-exempt (1,232 ) (1,848 ) 616 1,857 939 918 Loans (2) 76,709 25,020 51,689 26,335 30,596 (4,261 ) Total interest income 84,171 21,711 62,460 33,418 33,440 (22 ) Interest-bearing liabilities: Deposits: Demand deposits, interest-bearing 34,230 107 34,123 9,451 828 8,623 Savings deposits 169 (1 ) 170 83 35 48 Time deposits 24,082 2,970 21,112 242 (99 ) 341 Total interest-bearing deposits 58,481 3,076 55,405 9,776 764 9,012 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 4,770 228 4,542 1,564 43 1,521 FHLB advances 10,595 5,509 5,086 4,670 3,397 1,273 Federal funds purchased 1 (7 ) 8 9 6 3 Subordinated debt 251 251 6 6 Junior subordinated debentures 991 82 909 327 5 322 Other debt Total borrowings 16,608 6,063 10,545 6,576 3,457 3,119 Total interest expense 75,089 9,139 65,950 16,352 4,221 12,131 Net interest income $ 9,082 $ 12,572 $ (3,490 ) $ 17,066 $ 29,219 $ (12,153 ) (1) Changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate. (2) Nonaccrual loans have been included in the average balances. Balances are net of unaccreted discount related to loans acquired. Net interest income on a tax-effected basis increased $9.1 million or 4.8% in 2023 compared to an increase of $17.1 million or 10.0% in 2022. Net interest income on a tax-effected basis increased primarily due to the growth in average earnings assets including loans and interest-bearing deposits. The tax-effected net interest margin decreased primarily due to higher interest-bearing liability costs. In 2023, average earning assets increased by $449.1 million, or 7.5%, and average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $539.4 million or 12.0%. These increases were primarily due to assets and liabilities acquired from Blackhawk Bank. Changes in average balances are shown below: Average interest-bearing cash deposits held by the Company increased $26.1 million or 46.2% in 2023 compared to 2022. In 2022, average interest-bearing cash deposits held by the Company decreased $212.0 million or 79.0% compared to 2021. Average federal funds sold increased $2.5 million or 43.8% in 2023 compared to 2022. In 2022, average federal funds sold increased $4.4 million or 332.4% compared to 2021. Average certificates of deposit investments increased $0.1 million or 3.8% in 2023 compared to 2022. In 2022, average certificates of deposit investments decreased $0.9 million or 32.6% compared to 2021. Average loans increased by $561.4 million or 12.4% in 2023 compared to 2022. In 2022, average loans increased by $740.4 million or 19.6% compared to 2021. Average securities decreased by $141.0 million or 10.2% in 2023 compared to 2022. In 2022, average securities increased by $158.9 million or 13.0% compared to 2021. Average interest-bearing deposits increased by $323.3 million or 8.2% in 2023 compared to 2022.

Other Income An important source of the Company revenue is derived from other income. The following table sets forth the major components of other income for the last three years (in thousands): Change From Prior Year 2023 2022 2023 2022 2021 $ % $ % Wealth management revenues $ 20,793 $ 22,492 $ 20,407 $ (1,699 ) -7.6 % $ 2,085 10.2 % Insurance commissions 24,814 21,622 18,927 3,192 14.8 % 2,695 14.2 % Service charges 10,881 9,112 6,808 1,769 19.4 % 2,304 33.8 % Securities gains, net 3,383 33 124 3,350 10,151.5 % (91 ) -73.4 % Mortgage banking, net 2,282 1,190 4,718 1,092 91.8 % (3,528 ) -74.8 % ATM / debit card revenue 14,347 12,422 11,974 1,925 15.5 % 448 3.7 % Bank owned life insurance 4,957 3,559 3,039 1,398 39.3 % 520 17.1 % Other income 5,329 4,252 3,770 1,077 25.3 % 482 12.8 % Total other income $ 86,786 $ 74,682 $ 69,767 $ 12,104 16.2 % $ 4,915 7.0 % Total non-interest income increased to $86.8 million in 2023 compared to $74.7 million in 2022 and $69.8 million in 2021. The primary reasons for the more significant year-to-year changes in other income components are as follows: Wealth management revenues decreased in 2023 primarily due to lower commodity prices and higher interest rates resulting in less farm management income. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to growth in customer accounts and assets under management as well as rising commodity prices. Total assets under management were $6.1 billion at December 31, 2023 compared to $5.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and $5.1 billion at December 31, 2021. Insurance commissions increased in 2023 primarily due to higher commission and contingency income and the acquisition of PGIB Insurance. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to an increase in commission and contingency income. Fees from service charges increased in 2023 primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to the acquisition of Jefferson Bank. Net securities gains in 2023 were $3,383,000 compared to $33,000 in 2022 and $124,000 in 2021. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to securities sold soon after the close of the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. The increase in mortgage banking income during 2023 was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. Loans sold balances were as follows: $57.5 million (representing 413 loans) in 2023 $62.3 million (representing 422 loans) in 2022 $149.0 million (representing 1,011 loans) in 2021 First Mid Bank generally releases the servicing rights on loans sold into the secondary market. Revenue from ATMs and debit cards increased in 2023 primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank and in 2022 primarily due to the acquisition of Jefferson Bank. Bank owned life insurance increased during 2023 due to the addition of Blackhawk Bank and higher interest rates. The increase in 2022 was due to the acquisition of Jefferson Bank. Other income increased during 2023 primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. Other income increased during 2022 primarily due to the acquisition of Jefferson Bank. 23 Other Expense The major categories of other expense include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses and other operating expenses associated with day-to-day operations. The following table sets forth the major components of other expense for the last three years (dollars in thousands): Change From Prior Year 2023 2022 2023 2022 2021 $ % $ % Salaries and employee benefits $ 104,962 $ 98,594 $ 89,660 $ 6,368 6.5 % $ 8,934 10.0 % Net occupancy and equipment expense 26,946 24,257 21,546 2,689 11.1 % 2,711 12.6 % Net other real estate owned expense 1,862 330 3,866 1,532 464.2 % (3,536 ) -91.5 % FDIC insurance expense 3,339 1,805 1,604 1,534 85.0 % 201 12.5 % Amortization of other intangible assets 9,127 6,290 5,391 2,837 45.1 % 899 16.7 % Stationery and supplies 1,346 1,295 1,161 51 3.9 % 134 11.5 % Legal and professional 7,379 6,996 6,730 383 5.5 % 266 4.0 % Marketing and donations 3,005 2,999 3,603 6 0.2 % (604 ) -16.8 % ATM / debit card expense 5,322 4,300 3,116 1,022 23.8 % 1,184 38.0 % Other expense 22,452 15,995 18,902 6,457 40.4 % (2,907 ) -15.4 % Total other expense $ 185,740 $ 162,861 $ 155,579 $ 22,879 14.0 % $ 7,282 4.7 % Total non-interest expense increased to $185.7 million in 2023 from $162.9 million in 2022 and $155.6 million in 2021. The primary reasons for the more significant year-to-year changes in other expense components are as follows: Salaries and employee benefits, the largest component of other expense, increased primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank an increase in incentive compensation and commission, increases for merit raises and applicable payroll taxes, and an increase in employee group insurance expense, partially offset by a decline in bonus accrual expense. The increase in 2022 was due to the acquisition of Jefferson Bank and merit increases and applicable payroll taxes. There were 1,187 full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2023, compared to 1,043 at December 31, 2022, and 965 at December 31, 2021. Occupancy and equipment expense increased primarily due to increases in depreciation, equipment and other property related expenses from the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to additional properties added in the acquisition of Jefferson Bank and increases in expense for software and data processing. Net other real estate owned expense increased in 2023 primarily due to properties sold or written down during the period. The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to more properties sold at a net gain compared to properties sold at a net loss or written down. FDIC insurance expense increased due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank and an increase in the assessment rate. The increase in 2022 was due to the additional assets added with the acquisition of Jefferson Bank. Amortization of other intangibles increased during 2023 and 2022 were primarily due to additional core deposit intangibles added from the acquisitions of Blackhawk Bank and Jefferson Bank, respectively. ATM and debit card expenses increased primarily due to an increase in electronic transactions following the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank. The increase during 2022 was primarily due to an increase in electronic transactions following the acquisition of Jefferson Bank. Other operating expenses increased in 2023 primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank and nonrecurring costs associated with the closing and integration. The decrease during 2022 was due to less costs to acquire Delta compared to costs to acquire LINCO offset by additional expenses from the operation of Jefferson Bank. Income Taxes Income tax expense amounted to $19.5 million in 2023 compared to $18.3 million in 2022, and $15.3 million in 2021. Effective tax rates were 22.0% for 2023, 20.1% for 2022, and 22.9% for 2021. The Company files U.S. federal and state of Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Wisconsin income tax returns. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal or state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2020. Analysis of Balance Sheets Securities The Company overall investment objectives are to insulate the investment portfolio from undue credit risk, maintain adequate liquidity, insulate capital against changes in market value and control excessive changes in earnings while optimizing investment performance. The types and maturities of securities purchased are 24 primarily based on the Company current and projected liquidity and interest rate sensitivity positions.

While MBS and CMOs are no longer explicitly rated by credit rating agencies, the industry recognizes that they are backed by agencies which have an implied government guarantee. 25 Loans The loan portfolio (net of unearned interest) is the largest category of the Company earning assets. The following table summarizes the composition of the loan portfolio, including loans held for sale, for the last five years (dollars in thousands): Outstanding 2023 Loans 2022 2021 2020 2019 Construction and land development $ 205,077 3.7 % $ 144,264 $ 145,118 $ 122,479 $ 94,142 Agricultural real estate 391,132 7.0 % 410,327 279,272 254,341 240,241 1-4 family residential properties 542,469 9.7 % 440,180 400,313 325,762 336,427 Multifamily residential properties 319,129 5.7 % 294,346 298,942 189,632 153,948 Commercial real estate 2,384,704 42.8 % 2,030,011 1,666,198 1,174,300 995,702 Loans secured by real estate 3,842,511 68.9 % 3,319,128 2,789,843 2,066,514 1,820,460 Agricultural loans 196,272 3.5 % 166,838 151,484 137,352 136,124 Commercial and industrial loans 1,266,159 22.7 % 1,082,960 832,008 738,313 528,973 Consumer loans 91,014 1.6 % 97,775 78,442 78,002 83,183 All other loans 184,609 3.3 % 159,511 143,746 118,238 126,607 Total loans $ 5,580,565 100.0 % $ 4,826,212 $ 3,995,523 $ 3,138,419 $ 2,695,347 Loan balances increased by $754.4 million or 15.6% from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 which included approximately $730.2 million of gross loans acquired, after purchase accounting adjustments, from Blackhawk Bank. Loan balances increased by $830.7 million or 20.8% from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 of which approximately $418.5 million were loans, after purchase accounting adjustments, acquired from Jefferson Bank. The balances of loans sold into the secondary market were $62.2 million in 2023 compared to $62.3 million in 2022. The balance of real estate loans held for sale, included in the balances shown above, amounted to $5.0 million and $0.3 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Commercial and commercial real estate loans generally involve higher credit risks than residential real estate and consumer loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate or equipment are often dependent upon the successful operation and management of the underlying assets, repayment of such loans may be influenced to a great extent by conditions in the market or the economy. The Company does not have any sub-prime mortgages or credit card loans outstanding which are also generally considered to be higher credit risk. First Mid Bank does not have a concentration, as defined by the regulatory agencies, in construction and land development loans or commercial real estate loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital for the periods shown above. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, First Mid Bank did have industry loan concentrations in excess of 25% of total risk-based capital in the following industries (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Principal % Outstanding Principal % Outstanding balance Loans balance Loans Other grain farming $ 472,456 8.47 % $ 445,241 9.23 % Lessors of non-residential buildings 1,086,152 19.46 % 956,120 19.81 % Lessors of residential buildings and dwellings 541,858 9.71 % 453,219 9.39 % Hotels and motels 215,386 3.86 % 209,837 4.35 % The Company had no further industry loan concentrations in excess of 25% of total risk-based capital.

(2) Includes demand loans, past due loans and overdrafts. 26 As of December 31, 2023, loans with maturities over one year consisted of approximately $3.1 billion in fixed rate loans and approximately $1.7 billion in variable rate loans. The loan maturities noted above are based on the contractual provisions of the individual loans. The Company has no general policy regarding renewals and borrower requests, which are handled on a case-by-case basis. Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming Other Assets Nonperforming loans include: (a) loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis; (b) accruing loans contractually past due ninety days or more as to interest or principal payments; and (c) loans not included in (a) and (b) above which are defined as troubled debt restructurings . Repossessed assets include primarily repossessed real estate and automobiles. The Company policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest income on any loan for which principal or interest is ninety days past due. The accrual of interest is discontinued earlier when, in the opinion of management, there is reasonable doubt as to the timely collection of interest or principal. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged against current year income. Subsequent receipts on non-accrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when, in the opinion of management, the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the timely collection of interest or principal. Troubled debt restructurings are loans on which, due to deterioration in the borrower financial condition, the original terms have been modified in favor of the borrower or either principal or interest has been forgiven. Repossessed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. These assets are recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure or repossession. Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for credit losses. On an ongoing basis, properties are appraised as required by market indications and applicable regulations. Write-downs for subsequent declines in value are recorded in non-interest expense in other real estate owned along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties.

The Company also recognized $0 of deferred gains, recorded $1.9 million of write downs on seven real estate properties owned, and recorded a $2.3 million decrease fair market value discount. Loan Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses represents management estimate of the reserve necessary to adequately account for probable losses existing in the current portfolio. The provision for credit losses is the charge against current earnings that is determined by management as the amount needed to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, and therefore the provision to be charged to current earnings, management relies predominantly on a disciplined credit review and approval process that extends to the full range of the Company credit exposure. The review process is directed by overall lending policy and is intended to identify, at the earliest possible stage, borrowers who might be facing financial difficulty. Once identified, the magnitude of exposure to individual borrowers is quantified in the form of specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses. Management considers collateral values and guarantees in the determination of such specific allocations. Additional factors considered by management in evaluating the overall adequacy of the allowance include historical net credit losses, the level and composition of nonaccrual, past due and renegotiated loans, trends in volumes and terms of loans, effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards or lending practices, lending staff changes, concentrations of credit, industry conditions and the current economic conditions in the region where the Company operates. Management reviews economic factors including the potential for reduced cash flow for commercial operating loans from reduction in sales or increased operating costs, decreased occupancy rates for commercial buildings, reduced levels of home sales for commercial land developments, the uncertainty regarding grain prices, increased operating costs for farmers, and increased levels of unemployment and bankruptcy impacting consumers ability to pay. Each of these economic uncertainties was taken into consideration in developing the level of the reserve. Management considers the allowance for credit losses a critical accounting policy. Management recognizes there are risk factors that are inherent in the Company loan portfolio. All financial institutions face risk factors in their loan portfolios because risk exposure is a function of the business. The Company operations (and therefore its loans) are concentrated in east central Illinois, an area where agriculture is the dominant industry. Accordingly, lending and other business relationships with agriculture-based businesses are critical to the Company success. At December 31, 2023, the Company loan portfolio included $588.5 million of loans to borrowers whose businesses are directly related to agriculture. Of this amount, $472.5 million was concentrated in other grain farming. Total loans to borrowers whose businesses are directly related to agriculture increased $11.3 million from $577.2 million at December 31, 2022 while loans concentrated in other grain farming increased $27.2 million from $445.2 million at December 31, 2022. While the Company adheres to sound underwriting practices, including collateralization of loans, any extended period of low commodity prices, drought conditions, significantly reduced yields on crops and/or reduced levels of government assistance to the agricultural industry could result in an increase in the level of problem agriculture loans and potentially result in credit losses within the agricultural portfolio. In addition, the Company has $215.4 million of loans to motels and hotels. The performance of these loans is dependent on borrower specific issues as well as the general level of business and personal travel within the region. While the Company adheres to sound underwriting standards, a prolonged period of reduced business or personal travel could result in an increase in nonperforming loans to this business segment and potentially in credit losses. The Company also has $1.09 billion of loans to lessors of non-residential buildings and $541.9 million of loans to lessors of residential buildings and dwellings. The structure of the Company loan approval process is based on progressively larger lending authorities granted to individual loan officers, loan committees, and ultimately the Board of Directors. Outstanding balances to one borrower or affiliated borrowers are limited by federal regulation; however, limits well below the regulatory thresholds are generally observed. Most of the Company loans are to businesses located in the geographic market areas served by the Company branch bank system. Additionally, a significant portion of the collateral securing the loans in the portfolio is located within the Company primary geographic footprint. In general, the Company adheres to loan underwriting standards consistent with industry guidelines for all loan segments. 28 The Company minimizes credit risk by adhering to sound underwriting and credit review policies. Management and the Board of Directors of the Company review these policies at least annually. Senior management is actively involved in business development efforts and the maintenance and monitoring of credit underwriting and approval. The loan review system and controls are designed to identify, monitor, and address asset quality problems in an accurate and timely manner. On a quarterly basis, the Board of Directors and management review the status of problem loans and determine a best estimate of the allowance. In addition to internal policies and controls, regulatory authorities periodically review asset quality and the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Analysis of the allowance for credit losses for the past five years and of changes in the allowance for these periods is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Average loans outstanding, net of unearned income $ 5,079,949 $ 4,518,566 $ 3,778,142 $ 3,003,488 $ 2,598,718 Adjustment for adoption of ASU 2016-13 1,672 Allowance-beginning of period 59,093 54,655 41,910 28,583 26,189 Initial allowance on loans purchased with credit deterioration 3,791 863 2,074 Charge-offs: Construction and land development 14 2 205 13 1-4 family residential properties 87 191 371 393 1,477 Commercial real estate 25 414 535 830 1,743 Agricultural loans 408 93 24 Commercial and industrial loans 529 870 3,118 1,991 1,828 Consumer loans 1,568 1,380 1,405 617 1,254 Total charge-offs 2,631 2,950 5,634 3,844 6,326 Recoveries: Construction and land development 100 1-4 family residential properties 216 359 211 299 91 Commercial real estate 805 385 60 169 12 Agricultural loans 38 54 1 Commercial and industrial loans 576 208 139 179 155 Consumer loans 683 613 743 421 357 Total recoveries 2,318 1,719 1,154 1,068 615 Net charge-offs 313 1,231 4,480 2,776 5,711 Provision for credit losses 6,104 4,806 15,151 16,103 6,433 Allowance-end of period $ 68,675 $ 59,093 $ 54,655 $ 41,910 $ 26,911 Ratio of annualized net charge-offs to average loans 0.01 % 0.03 % 0.12 % 0.09 % 0.22 % Ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans outstanding (less unearned interest at end of period) 1.23 % 1.22 % 1.37 % 1.34 % 1.00 % Ratio of allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans 341.2 % 308.3 % 248.0 % 149.0 % 96.7 % The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 341.2% as of December 31, 2023 compared to 308.3% as of December 31, 2022. The increase in this ratio is primarily due to an increase in the allowance. Management believes that the overall estimate of the allowance for credit losses appropriately accounts for probable losses attributable to current exposures. During 2023, the Company had net charge-offs of $313,000 compared to $1,231,000 in 2022. During 2023, there were significant charge-offs of one ag operating loan to one borrower of $181,000 and significant charge-off of one commercial operating loan to one borrower of $353,000. During 2022, there were significant charge-offs of two commercial real estate loans to one borrower of $271,000 and significant charge-offs of two commercial operating loans to two borrowers of $739,000. At December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses amounted to $68.7 million or 1.23% of total loans. At December 31, 2022, the allowance for credit losses amounted to $59.1 million or 1.22% of total loans. The allowance is allocated to the individual loan categories by a specific allocation for all classified loans plus a percentage of loans not classified based on historical losses and other factors. The allowance for credit losses, in management's judgment, was allocated as follows to cover probable credit losses (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 % of loans to % of loans to % of loans to Allowance for credit losses total loans Allowance for credit losses total loans Allowance for credit losses total loans Construction and land development $ 2,918 3.7 % $ 2,250 3.0 % $ 1,743 3.6 % Agriculture real estate 1,366 7.0 % 1,433 8.5 % 1,257 7.0 % 1-4 family residential 4,220 9.7 % 3,742 9.1 % 2,330 10.0 % Commercial real estate 31,758 48.5 % 28,157 48.2 % 26,246 49.2 % Agricultural loans 705 3.5 % 585 3.5 % 983 3.8 % Commercial and industrial 25,450 26.0 % 20,808 25.7 % 19,241 24.4 % Consumer 2,258 1.6 % 2,118 2.0 % 2,855 2.0 % Total allocated 68,675 100.0 % 59,093 100.0 % 54,655 100.0 % Allowance at end of year $ 68,675 100.0 % $ 59,093 100.0 % $ 54,655 100.0 % 29 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 % of loans to % of loans to Allowance for credit losses total loans Allowance for credit losses total loans Construction and land development $ 1,666 3.9 % $ 1,146 3.5 % Agriculture real estate 1,084 8.1 % 1,093 8.9 % 1-4 family residential 2,322 10.4 % 1,386 12.5 % Commercial real estate 19,660 43.4 % 11,198 42.6 % Agricultural loans 1,526 4.4 % 1,386 5.1 % Commercial and industrial 13,485 27.3 % 9,273 24.3 % Consumer 2,167 2.5 % 1,429 3.1 % Total allocated 41,910 100.0 % 26,911 100.0 % Allowance at end of year $ 41,910 100.0 % $ 26,911 100.0 % Deposits Funding of the Company earning assets is substantially provided by a combination of consumer, commercial and public fund deposits.

The increase in 2023 was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank, partially offset by higher rates driving outflows. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to deposits added in the acquisition of Jefferson Bank offset by maturing time deposits. Balances of time deposits of $100,000 or more include time deposits maintained for public fund entities and consumer time deposits. The following table sets forth the maturity of time deposits of $100,000 or more (in thousands): December 31, 2023 2022 2021 3 months or less $ 183,619 $ 80,856 $ 86,790 Over 3 through 6 months 231,187 31,771 57,777 Over 6 through 12 months 170,641 127,405 82,644 Over 12 months 117,657 183,597 75,568 Total $ 703,104 $ 423,629 $ 302,779 The balance of time deposits of $100,000 or more increased $279.5 million from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to time deposits acquired from Blackhawk Bank. The balance of time deposits of $100,000 or more increased $120.9 million from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to time deposits acquired from Jefferson Bank. In 2023 the Company maintained account relationships with various public entities throughout its market areas. These public entities had total balances of $381.3 million and $319.4 million in various checking accounts and time deposits as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These balances are subject to change depending upon the cash flow needs of the public entity. Repurchase Agreements and Other Borrowings 30 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are short-term obligations of First Mid Bank. These obligations are collateralized with certain government securities that are direct obligations of the United States or one of its agencies. These retail repurchase agreements are a cash management service to its corporate customers. Other borrowings consist of Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) advances, federal funds purchased, loans (short-term or long-term debt) that the Company has outstanding, subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures. Information relating to securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings as December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 is presented below (dollars in thousands): 2023 2022 2021 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 213,721 $ 221,414 $ 146,268 Federal Home Loan Bank advances: FHLB-overnite 65,000 Fixed term due in one year or less 60,000 110,040 25,113 Fixed term due after one year 203,787 290,031 61,333 Subordinated debt 106,755 94,553 94,400 Junior subordinated debentures 24,058 19,364 19,195 Total $ 608,321 $ 800,402 $ 346,309 Average interest rate at end of period 4.41 % 2.52 % 1.78 % Maximum outstanding at any month-end: Securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 231,650 $ 257,061 $ 212,503 Federal funds purchased 10,000 Federal Home Loan Bank advances: FHLB-overnite 150,000 310,000 Fixed term due in one year or less 105,024 160,048 30,180 Fixed term due after one year 415,005 290,031 97,877 Subordinated debt 106,755 94,553 94,400 Junior subordinated debentures 24,058 19,364 19,195 Debt: Debt due in one year or less Averages for the period (YTD): Securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 225,307 $ 202,242 $ 173,762 Federal funds purchased 192 481 Federal Home Loan Bank advances: FHLB-overnite 55,104 100,084 Fixed term due in one year or less 95,669 94,247 22,751 Fixed term due after one year 311,424 82,070 84,766 Subordinated debt 99,638 94,471 94,321 Junior subordinated debentures 21,337 19,275 19,105 Debt: Loans due in one year or less 14 Total $ 808,671 $ 592,884 $ 394,705 Average interest rate during the period 2.16 % 2.16 % 1.58 % Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $7.7 million during 2023 primarily due to the seasonal demands in balances and change in cash flow needs of various customers. FHLB advances represent borrowings by the First Mid Bank to economically fund loan demand. At December 31, 2023 FHLB advances totaled $264 million with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.58% and maturities from May 2024 to December 2029. At December 31, 2022 FHLB advances totaled $465 million with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.48% and maturities from January 2023 to December 2032. The Company is party to a revolving credit agreement with The Northern Trust Company in the amount of $15 million. The balance on this line of credit was $0 as of December 31, 2023. This loan was renewed on April 7, 2023 for one year as a revolving credit agreement with a maximum available balance of $15 million. The interest rate is floating at 2.25% over the federal funds rate. The Company and its subsidiary banks were in compliance with the existing covenants at December 31, 2023 and 2022. On October 6, 2020, the Company issued and sold $96.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.95% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2030 (the Notes ). The Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of October 6, 2020 (the Base Indenture ), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the Trustee ), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 6, 2020 (the Supplemental Indenture ), between the Company and the Trustee. The Base Indenture, as amended and supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, governs the terms of the Notes and provides that the Notes are unsecured, subordinated debt obligations of the Company and will mature on October 15, 2030. From and including the date of issuance to, but excluding October 15, 2025, the Notes will bear interest at an initial rate of 3.95% per annum. From and including October 15, 2025 to, but excluding the maturity date or earlier redemption, the Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month Term SOFR plus a spread of 383 basis points, or such other rate as determined pursuant to the Supplemental Indenture, provided that in no event shall the applicable floating interest rate be less than zero per annum. 31 The Company may, beginning with the interest payment date of October 15, 2025, and on any interest payment date thereafter, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. The Company may also redeem the Notes at any time, including prior to October 15, 2025, at the Company option, in whole but not in part, if: (i) a change or prospective change in law occurs that could prevent the Company from deducting interest payable on the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (ii) a subsequent event occurs that could preclude the Notes from being recognized as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes; or (iii) the Company is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; in each case, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the redemption date. At December 31, 2023, the recorded balance of the subordinated notes was $106,755,000. On August 15, 2023, the Company assumed, as part of the Blackhawk Bancorp, Inc. acquisition, $7.5 million principal amount of 3.5% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2031 ( Blackhawk Subordinated Debt I ). Blackhawk Subordinated Debt I was issued pursuant to Indenture between the Company and UMB Bank, as trustee. This Indenture governs the terms of the Blackhawk Subordinated Debt I and provides that such notes are unsecured, subordinated debt obligations of the Company and will mature on May 14, 2031. From and including the date of issuance to, but excluding May 14, 2026, the notes will bear interest at an initial rate of 3.5% per annum. From and including May 14, 2026 to, but excluding the maturity date, the notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month Term SOFR plus a spread of 285 basis points. On August 15, 2023, the Company assumed, as part of the Blackhawk Bancorp, Inc. acquisition, $7.5 million principal amount of 3.875% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2036 ( Blackhawk Subordinated Debt II ). Blackhawk Subordinated Debt II was issued pursuant to Indenture between the Company and UMB Bank, as trustee. This Indenture governs the terms of the Blackhawk Subordinated Debt II and provides that such notes are unsecured, subordinated debt obligations of the Company and will mature on May 14, 2036. From and including the date of issuance to, but excluding May 14, 2031, the notes will bear interest at an initial rate of 3.875% per annum. From and including May 14, 2031 to, but excluding the maturity date, the notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month Term SOFR plus a spread of 255 basis points. On April 26, 2006, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $10 million of fixed/floating rate trust preferred securities through First Mid-Illinois Statutory Trust II ( Trust II ), a statutory business trust and wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of the Company, as part of a pooled offering. The Company established Trust II for the purpose of issuing the trust preferred securities. The $10 million in proceeds from the trust preferred issuance and an additional $310,000 for the Company investment in common equity of Trust II, a total of $10,310,000, was invested in junior subordinated debentures of the Company. The underlying junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company to Trust II mature in 2036, bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.98% paid quarterly until June 15, 2011 and then converted to floating rate (LIBOR plus 160 basis points) after June 15, 2011 (7.25% and 6.37% at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively). The net proceeds to the Company were used for general corporate purposes, including the Company acquisition of Mansfield Bancorp, Inc. in 2006. On September 8, 2016, the Company assumed the trust preferred securities of Clover Leaf Statutory Trust I ( CLST I ), a statutory business trust that was a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of First Clover Financial. The $4,000,000 of trust preferred securities and an additional $124,000 additional investment in common equity of CLST I, is invested in junior subordinated debentures issued to CLST I. The subordinated debentures mature in 2025, bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 185 basis points (7.50% and 6.47% at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively) and resets quarterly. On May 1, 2018, the Company assumed the trust preferred securities of FBTC Statutory Trust I ( FBTCST I ), a statutory business trust that was a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of First BancTrust Corporation. The $6,000,000 of trust preferred securities and an additional $186,000 additional investment in common equity of FBTCST I is invested in junior subordinated debentures issued to FBTCST I. The subordinated debentures mature in 2035, bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 170 basis points (7.35% and 6.62% at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively) and resets quarterly. On August 15, 2023, the Company assumed the trust preferred securities of Blackhawk Statutory Trust I ( BHST I ), a statutory business trust that was a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of Blackhawk Bancorp, Inc. The $1,000,000 of trust preferred securities and an additional $31,000 investment in common equity of BHST I is invested in junior subordinated debentures issued to BHST I. The subordinated debentures mature in 2032, bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 325 basis points (8.87% at December 31, 2023) and resets quarterly. On August 15, 2023, the Company assumed the trust preferred securities of Blackhawk Statutory Trust II ( BHST II ), a statutory business trust that was a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of Blackhawk Bancorp, Inc. The $4,000,000 of trust preferred securities and an additional $124,000 investment in common equity of BHST II is invested in junior subordinated debentures issued to BHST II. The subordinated debentures mature in 2035, bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 205 basis points (7.69% at December 31, 2023) and resets quarterly. The trust preferred securities issued by Trust II, CLST I, FBTCST I, BHST I, and BHST II are included as Tier 1 capital of the Company for regulatory capital purposes. On March 1, 2005, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule that allows the continued limited inclusion of trust preferred securities in the calculation of Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes. The final rule provided a five-year transition period, ending September 30, 2010, for application of the revised quantitative limits. On March 17, 2009, the Federal Reserve Board adopted an additional final rule that delayed the effective date of the new limits on inclusion of trust preferred securities in the calculation of Tier 1 capital until March 31, 2012. The application of the revised quantitative limits did not and is not expected to have a significant impact on its calculation of Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes or its classification as well-capitalized. The Dodd-Frank Act, signed into law July 21, 2010, removes trust preferred securities as a permitted component of a holding company Tier 1 capital after a three-year phase-in period beginning January 1, 2013 for larger holding companies. For holding companies with less than $15 billion in consolidated assets, existing issues of trust preferred securities are grandfathered and not subject to this new restriction. New issuances of trust preferred securities, however, would not count as Tier 1 regulatory capital. 32 In addition to requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act discussed above, the act also required the federal banking agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds). This rule is generally referred to as the Volcker Rule. On December 10, 2013, the federal banking agencies issued final rules to implement the prohibitions required by the Volcker Rule. Following the publication of the final rule, and in reaction to concerns in the banking industry regarding the adverse impact the final rule treatment of certain collateralized debt instruments has on community banks, the federal banking agencies approved a final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities. Under the final rule, the agencies permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered funds by banking entities under $15 billion in assets if (1) the collateralized debt obligation was established and issued prior to May 19, 2010, (2) the banking entity reasonably believes that the offering proceeds received by the collateralized debt obligation were invested primarily in qualifying trust preferred collateral, and (3) the banking entity interests in the collateralized debt obligation was acquired on or prior to December 10, 2013. Although the Volcker Rule impacts many large banking entities, the Company does not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will have a material effect on the operations of the Company or First Mid Bank. Interest Rate Sensitivity The Company seeks to maximize its net interest margin while maintaining an acceptable level of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk can be defined as the amount of forecasted net interest income that may be gained or lost due to changes in the interest rate environment, a variable over which management has no control. Interest rate risk, or sensitivity, arises when the maturity or repricing characteristics of interest-bearing assets differ significantly from the maturity or repricing characteristics of interest-bearing liabilities. The Company monitors its interest rate sensitivity position to maintain a balance between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities. This balance serves to limit the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. The Company asset liability management committee (ALCO) oversees the interest rate sensitivity position and directs the overall allocation of funds. In the banking industry, a traditional way to measure potential net interest income exposure to changes in interest rates is through a technique known as static GAP analysis which measures the cumulative differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities maturing or repricing at various intervals. By comparing the volumes of interest-bearing assets and liabilities that have contractual maturities and repricing points at various times in the future, management can gain insight into the amount of interest rate risk embedded in the balance sheet. The following table sets forth the Company interest rate repricing GAP for selected maturity periods at December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands): Rate Sensitive Within 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years Thereafter Total Fair Value Interest-earning assets: Federal funds sold and other interest-bearing deposits $ 20,193 $ $ $ $ $ $ 20,193 $ 20,193 Certificates of deposit investments 735 490 245 1,470 1,470 Taxable investment securities 184,129 96,489 82,010 106,195 144,101 280,283 893,207 893,207 Nontaxable investment securities 8,904 2,918 4,678 9,886 9,705 248,634 284,725 284,725 Loans 2,174,251 859,277 1,124,599 996,250 168,521 257,667 5,580,565 5,309,179 Total $ 2,388,212 $ 959,174 $ 1,211,532 $ 1,112,331 $ 322,327 $ 786,584 $ 6,780,160 $ 6,508,774 Interest-bearing liabilities: Savings and NOW accounts $ 636,965 $ 216,101 $ 216,101 $ 216,101 $ 216,101 $ 1,046,513 $ 2,547,882 $ 2,547,882 Money market accounts 658,208 74,498 74,498 74,498 74,498 173,750 1,129,950 1,129,950 Other time deposits 872,385 93,316 24,669 46,962 9,916 345 1,047,593 966,211 Short-term borrowings/debt 213,721 213,721 213,714 Long-term borrowings/debt 84,069 8,776 131,755 50,000 100,000 20,000 394,600 384,748 Total $ 2,465,348 $ 392,691 $ 447,023 $ 387,561 $ 400,515 $ 1,240,608 $ 5,333,746 $ 5,242,505 Rate sensitive assets rate sensitive liabilities $ (77,136 ) $ 566,483 $ 764,509 $ 724,770 $ (78,188 ) $ (454,024 ) $ 1,446,414 Cumulative GAP $ (77,136 ) $ 489,347 $ 1,253,856 $ 1,978,626 $ 1,900,438 $ 1,446,414 Cumulative amounts as % of total rate sensitive assets (1.1 )% 8.4 % 11.3 % 10.7 % (1.2 )% (6.7 )% Cumulative ratio (1.1 )% 7.2 % 18.5 % 29.2 % 28.0 % 21.3 % The static GAP analysis shows that at December 31, 2023, the Company was liability sensitive, on a cumulative basis, through the twelve-month time horizon. This indicates that future increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest income. There are several ways the Company measures and manages the exposure to interest rate sensitivity, including static GAP analysis. The Company ALCO also uses other financial models to project interest income under various rate scenarios and prepayment/extension assumptions consistent with First Mid Bank historical experience and with known industry trends. ALCO meets at least monthly to review the Company exposure to interest rate changes as indicated by the various techniques and to make necessary changes in the composition terms and/or rates of the assets and liabilities. 33 Capital Resources At December 31, 2023, the Company stockholders' equity had increased approximately $160.0 million, or 25.3%, to $793.2 million from $633.2 million as of December 31, 2022. During 2023, net income contributed $68.9 million to equity before the payment of dividends to stockholders of $19.6 million.

See Note 9 Borrowings for a more detailed description. Effects of Inflation Unlike industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on the Company performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or experience the same magnitude of changes as goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation. In the current economic environment, liquidity and interest rate adjustments are features of the Company assets and liabilities that are important to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels. The Company attempts to maintain a balance between monetary assets and monetary liabilities, over time, to offset these potential effects.
