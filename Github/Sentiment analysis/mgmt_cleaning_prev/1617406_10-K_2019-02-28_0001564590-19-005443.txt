Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements, related notes included thereto and Item 1A., Risk Factors, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview We have a diverse portfolio of iconic and market-leading hotels and resorts with significant underlying real estate value. We hold investments in entities that have ownership or leasehold interests in 52 hotels, consisting of premium-branded hotels and resorts with over 30,000 rooms, of which over 85% are luxury and upper upscale and over 97% are located in the U.S. Luxury and upper upscale refers to luxury hotels and upper upscale hotels as defined by Smith Travel Research. Our high-quality portfolio includes hotels in major urban and convention areas, such as New York City, Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco and New Orleans; premier resorts in key leisure destinations, including Hawaii, Orlando and Key West; and hotels adjacent to major gateway airports, such as Los Angeles International, Boston Logan International and Miami International, as well as hotels in select suburban locations. Our objective is to be the preeminent lodging real estate investment trust ( REIT ), focused on consistently delivering superior, risk-adjusted returns to stockholders through active asset management and a thoughtful external growth strategy while maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet. As a pure-play real estate company with direct access to capital and independent financial resources, we believe our enhanced ability to implement compelling return on investment initiatives within our portfolio represents a significant embedded growth opportunity. Finally, given our scale and investment expertise, we believe we will be able to successfully execute single-asset and portfolio acquisitions and dispositions to further enhance the value and diversification of our assets throughout the lodging cycle, including potentially taking advantage of the economies of scale that could come from consolidation in the lodging REIT industry. We operate our business through two operating segments, our consolidated hotels and unconsolidated hotels. Our consolidated hotels operating segment is our only reportable segment. Refer to Note 15: Geographic and Business Segment Information in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our operating segments. Spin-Off from Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. On January 3, 2017, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. ( Hilton or Parent ) completed the spin-off of a portfolio of hotels and resorts that resulted in the establishment of Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. ( we, us, our or the Company ) as an independent, publicly traded company. As a result of the agreements we entered into in connection with the spin-off and our intention to elect to be taxed as a REIT, the below items affected the comparability of our results of operations. In connection with the spin-off, we entered into agreements, including long-term hotel management and franchise agreements, with our hotel managers that have either not existed historically, or that are on different terms than the terms of the arrangement or agreements that existed prior to the spin-off. Our pre-spin consolidated financial statements do not reflect the effect of these new or revised agreements and our pre-spin expenses, including corporate and other expense and management fee expense, may not be reflective of our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows had we been a stand-alone company during the periods discussed in our Results of Operations section. We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our tax year ended December 31, 2017. We believe we are currently organized and operate consistent with the requirements to be a REIT and we expect to continue to be organized and operate so as to qualify as a REIT. So long as we qualify as a REIT, except as it relates to our U.S. taxable REIT subsidiaries, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on income that we distribute annually to our stockholders. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the real estate qualification of sources of our income, the real estate composition and values of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the diversity of ownership of our stock. In order to comply with REIT requirements, we may need to forego otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities and the manner in which we conduct our operations. We expect to make distributions to our stockholders in amounts that equal or exceed the requirements to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Prior to making any distributions, we must first satisfy our operating and debt service obligations. Although we currently anticipate that our estimated cash available for distribution will exceed the REIT annual distribution requirements (including to avoid corporate level taxation), it is possible that it would be necessary to utilize cash reserves, liquidate assets at unfavorable prices or incur additional indebtedness in order to make required distributions. 46 Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements reflect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ). The pre-spin consolidated financial statements represent the financial position and results of operations of a combination of entities under common control that have been carved out of Hilton consolidated financial statements and reflect significant assumptions and allocations. References to pre-spin periods within this Annual Report on Form 10-K are for periods prior to the spin-off date of January 3, 2017. Refer to Note 2: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. The pre-spin consolidated statements of comprehensive income include the results of operations of the DoubleTree Hotel Missoula/Edgewater and the Hilton Templepatrick Hotel & Country Club in each of the periods discussed in this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In September 2016, we distributed interests in entities with ownership interests in these two hotels as they were not retained by us after the spin-off. Accordingly, these hotels were not reflected in our consolidated financial statements from and after such distribution. These hotels were not material to our results of operations in any of the pre-spin periods reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to Note 14: Net Parent Investment in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Outlook The U.S. lodging industry benefited during 2018 from a positive macro-economic landscape overall, with third quarter of 2018 gross domestic product ( GDP ) increasing 3.4%, coupled with continued improvements in non-residential fixed business investment, a key indicator of RevPAR performance. Our ability to experience continued RevPAR growth during 2019 depends on various factors, including the strength of group and transient demand and the timing of completion of renovation projects at several of our hotels. In addition, RevPAR growth and profitability will depend on macroeconomic factors, including corporate profitability consumer confidence, unemployment rates (and resulting increase in wages) and GDP growth, supply growth and increased popularity of online booking services and short-term lodging websites. Recent Events The City of Chicago did not extend the ground lease for the Hilton Chicago O Hare Airport, which ended on December 31, 2018, and assumed ownership of the hotel on that date . Additionally, in February 2019, we sold the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort for a sales price of approximately $51 million. Principal Components of and Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations Revenues Revenues from our hotels are primarily derived from two categories of customers: transient and group, which account for approximately two thirds and one third, respectively, of our rooms revenue. Transient guests are individual travelers who are traveling for business or leisure. Group guests are traveling for group events that reserve rooms for meetings, conferences or social functions sponsored by associations, corporate, social, military, educational, religious or other organizations. Group business usually includes a block of room accommodations, as well as other ancillary services, such as meeting facilities, catering and banquet services. A majority of our food and beverage sales and other ancillary services are provided to customers who also are occupying rooms at our hotels. As a result, occupancy affects all components of revenues from our hotels. Principal Components Rooms . Represents the sale of room rentals at our hotels and accounts for a substantial majority of our total revenue. Food and beverage . Represents revenue from group functions, which may include both banquet revenue and audio and visual revenue, as well as revenue from outlets such as restaurants and lounges at our hotels. Ancillary hotel. Represents revenue for guest services provided at our hotels, including parking, telecommunications, golf course and spa. Also includes tenant leases and other rental revenue. Other. Represents revenue related to our laundry business and support services we provide to Hilton Grand Vacations ( HGV ) timeshare properties that have a presence within or adjacent to certain of our hotels, which include cost reimbursements for the costs of providing housekeeping, landscaping, general maintenance and other services plus a fee representing a percentage of cost reimbursements. 47 Factors Affecting our Revenues Consumer demand . Consumer demand for our products and services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. Leading indicators of demand include gross domestic product, non-residential fixed investment and the consumer price index. Declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions, reductions in travel patterns, lower consumer confidence and adverse political conditions can lower the revenues and profitability of our hotels. Further, competition for guests and the supply of services at our hotels affect our ability to sustain or increase rates charged to customers at our hotels. As a result, changes in consumer demand and general business cycles have historically subjected and could in the future subject our revenues to significant volatility. In addition, leisure travelers make up the majority of our transient demand. Therefore, we will be significantly more affected by trends in leisure travel than trends in business travel. Supply . New room supply is an important factor that can affect the lodging industry performance. Room rates and occupancy, and thus RevPAR, tend to increase when demand growth exceeds supply growth. The addition of new competitive hotels and resorts affects the ability of existing hotels and resorts to sustain or grow RevPAR, and thus profits. New development is determined largely by construction costs, the availability of financing and expected performance of existing hotels and resorts. Expenses Principal Components Rooms . These costs include housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services at our hotels and front desk costs. Food and beverage . These costs primarily include food, beverage and the associated labor and will correlate closely with food and beverage revenues. Other departmental and support . These costs include labor and other costs associated with other ancillary revenue, such as parking, telecommunications, golf course and spa, as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments, sales and marketing, repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs. Other property-level . These costs consist primarily of real and personal property taxes, other local taxes, ground rent, equipment rent and property insurance. Management and franchise fees . Base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue. Incentive management fees generally are paid if specified financial performance targets are achieved. Franchise fees for our Select Hotels are generally computed as a percentage of rooms revenues. Refer to Item 1: Business Our Principal Agreements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Casualty (gain) loss and impairment loss, net. Casualty losses are expenses that represent losses incurred resulting from property damage or destruction caused by any sudden, unexpected or unusual event such as a hurricane. Impairment losses are non-cash expenses that are recognized when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Depreciation and amortization . These are non-cash expenses that primarily consist of depreciation of fixed assets such as buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment at our hotels and certain assets from our laundry facilities, as well as amortization of finite lived intangible assets. Corporate general & administrative. These costs include general and administrative expenses, including costs associated with the potential disposition of hotels. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense for our corporate staff and personnel supporting our business, professional fees, travel and entertainment expenses, and office administrative and related expenses. The pre-spin financial statements included general and administrative expenses allocated to us by Hilton on the basis of financial and operating metrics that were historically used by Hilton to allocate resources and evaluate performance against its strategic objectives. Other. These costs include expenses for our laundry business and costs to provide support services to certain HGV timeshare properties. 48 Factors Affecting our Costs and Expenses Variable expenses . Expenses associated with our room expense and food and beverage expense are mainly affected by occupancy and correlate closely with their respective revenues. These expenses can increase based on increases in salaries and wages, as well as on the level of service and amenities that are provided. Additionally, food and beverage expense is affected by the mix of business between banquet, catering and outlet sales. Fixed expenses . Many of the other expenses associated with our hotels are relatively fixed. These expenses include portions of rent expense, property taxes and insurance. Since we generally are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels decreases, any resulting decline in our revenues can have a greater adverse effect on our net cash flow, margins and profits. This effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth. The effectiveness of any cost-cutting efforts is limited by the amount of fixed costs inherent in our business. As a result, we may not be able to successfully offset revenue reductions through cost cutting. The individuals employed at certain of our hotels are party to collective bargaining agreements with our hotel managers that may also limit the manager ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues. In addition, any efforts to reduce costs, or to defer or cancel capital improvements, could adversely affect the economic value of our hotels. We have taken steps to reduce our fixed costs to levels we believe are appropriate to maximize profitability and respond to market conditions without jeopardizing the overall customer experience or the value of our hotels. Changes in depreciation and amortization expense . Changes in depreciation expense are due to renovations of existing hotels, acquisition or development of new hotels, the disposition of existing hotels through sale or closure or changes in estimates of the useful lives of our assets. As we place new assets into service, we will be required to recognize additional depreciation expense on those assets. Other Items Effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations Certain of our hotels operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency, which is the United States ( U.S. ) dollar ( USD ), and we have assets and liabilities denominated in a variety of foreign currencies. As a result, we are required to translate those results, assets and liabilities from the functional currency into USD at market based exchange rates for each reporting period. When comparing our results of operations between periods, there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in exchange rates experienced between those periods. Seasonality The lodging industry is seasonal in nature. However, the periods during which our hotels experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from hotel to hotel and depend upon location, type of hotel and competitive mix within the specific location. Key Business Metrics Used by Management Comparable Hotels Data We present certain data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis as supplemental information for investors. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) were active and operating in our portfolio since January 1st of the previous year; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage, business interruption, undergone large-scale capital projects or for which comparable results are not available. We present comparable hotel results to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. 2018 Comparable Hotels Of the 46 hotels that we consolidated as of December 31, 2018, 44 hotels have been classified as comparable hotels. Due to the conversion of a significant number of rooms at the Hilton Waikoloa Village to HGV timeshare units in 2017, and due to the effects of business interruption from Hurricane Maria at the Caribe Hilton in Puerto Rico, the results from these properties were excluded from our comparable hotels. Our comparable hotels as of December 31, 2018 also exclude the 12 consolidated hotels that were sold in January and February 2018. Refer to Note 3: Dispositions and Assets Held for Sale in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 49 2017 Comparable Hotels Of the 58 hotels that we consolidated as of December 31, 2017, 55 hotels were classified as comparable hotels. Due to the conversion, or planned conversions, of a significant number of rooms at the Hilton Waikoloa Village and Embassy Suites Washington DC Georgetown in 2016 to HGV timeshare units, and due to the effects of business interruption from Hurricane Maria at the Caribe Hilton in Puerto Rico, the results from these properties were excluded from our comparable hotels. Our comparable hotels as of December 31, 2017 also included the 12 consolidated hotels that were sold in January and February 2018. Refer to Note 3: Dispositions and Assets Held for Sale in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 2016 Comparable Hotels Our comparable hotels as of December 31, 2016 exclude the DoubleTree Hotel Missoula/Edgewater and the Hilton Templepatrick Hotel & Country Club, as these hotels were not retained by us as part of the spin-off. Occupancy Occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels. Occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity. Management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. Occupancy levels also help us determine achievable Average Daily Rate ( ADR ) levels as demand for rooms increases or decreases. Average Daily Rate ADR represents rooms revenue divided by total number of room nights sold in a given period. ADR measures average room price attained by a hotel and ADR trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. ADR is a commonly used performance measure in the hotel industry, and we use ADR to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer, as changes in rates have a more pronounced effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy, as described above. Revenue per Available Room Revenue per Available Room ( RevPAR ) represents rooms revenue divided by the total number of room nights available to guests for a given period. We consider RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key factors of operations at a hotel or group of hotels: occupancy and ADR. RevPAR is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels. References to RevPAR, ADR and occupancy are presented on a comparable basis and references to RevPAR and ADR are presented on a currency neutral basis (prior periods are reflected using current period exchange rates), unless otherwise noted. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We also evaluate the performance of our business through certain other financial measures that are not recognized under U.S. GAAP. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to GAAP performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit and net income. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA, presented herein, reflects net income excluding depreciation and amortization, interest income, interest expense, income taxes and interest expense, income tax and depreciation and amortization included in equity in earnings from investments in affiliates. Adjusted EBITDA, presented herein, is calculated as EBITDA, further adjusted to exclude: 50 Gains or losses on sales of assets f or both consolidated and unconsolidated investments; Gains or losses on foreign currency transactions; Transition expense related to our establishment as an independent, publicly traded company; Transaction costs associated with hotel acquisition or disposition costs expensed during the period; Severance expense; Share-based compensation expense; Casualty and impairment losses; and Other items that we believe are not representative of our current or future operating performance. Hotel Adjusted EBITDA measures hotel-level results before debt service, depreciation and corporate expenses for our consolidated hotels, including both comparable and non-comparable hotels but excluding hotels owned by unconsolidated affiliates, and is a key measure of our profitability. We present Hotel Adjusted EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our consolidated hotels. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our definitions of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA are among the measures used by our management team to make day-to-day operating decisions and evaluate our operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the effect of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results; and (ii) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) or other methods of analyzing our operating performance and results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense; EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our income tax expense; EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations; and other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. We do not use or present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA as measures of our liquidity or cash flow. These measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow or other methods of analyzing our cash flows and liquidity as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash requirements to pay our taxes; EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; and although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. 51 Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our busin ess or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. The following table provides the components of Hotel Adjusted EBITDA: Year Ended December 31, 2018 (1) 2017 (2) 2016 (3) (in millions) Comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA $ 716 $ 709 $ 670 Non-comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA 45 49 134 Hotel Adjusted EBITDA $ 761 $ 758 $ 804 (1) Based on our 2018 comparable hotels as of December 31, 2018. (2) Based on our 2017 comparable hotels as of December 31, 2017. (3) Based on our 2016 comparable hotels as of December 31, 2016. The following table provides a reconciliation of Net income to Hotel Adjusted EBITDA: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) Net income $ 477 $ 2,631 $ 139 Depreciation and amortization expense 277 288 300 Interest income (6 ) (2 ) (2 ) Interest expense 127 124 181 Income tax expense (benefit) 23 (2,346 ) 82 Interest expense, income tax and depreciation and amortization included in equity in earnings from investments in affiliates 26 24 24 EBITDA 924 719 724 Gain on sales of assets, net (96 ) (1 ) (1 ) Gain on sale of investments in affiliates (1) (107 ) Loss (gain) on foreign currency transactions 3 4 (3 ) Transition expense 3 9 26 Transaction expense 2 2 Severance expense 2 1 Share-based compensation expense 16 14 Casualty (gain) loss and impairment loss, net (1 ) 26 15 Impairment loss included in equity in earnings from investments in affiliates 17 Other items (2) 8 (17 ) 36 Adjusted EBITDA 754 757 814 Less: Adjusted EBITDA from investments in affiliates 45 45 44 Less: All other (3) (52 ) (46 ) (34 ) Hotel Adjusted EBITDA $ 761 $ 758 $ 804 (1) Included in other gain (loss), net . (2) For 2017, includes $18 million of distributions received from investments in affiliates in excess of the investment balance that were included within equity in earnings from investments in affiliates in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. For 2016, includes $19 million of deferred financing costs expensed in connection with the extinguishment of CMBS debt. (3) Includes other revenues and other expenses , non-income taxes on REIT leases included in other property-level expenses and corporate general and administrative expenses . 52 NAREIT FFO attributable to stockholders and Adjusted FFO attributable to stockholders We present NAREIT FFO attributable to stockholders and NAREIT FFO per diluted share (defined as set forth below) as non-GAAP measures of our performance. We calculate funds from operations ( FFO ) attributable to stockholders for a given operating period in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ), as net income or loss attributable to stockholders (calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on sales of assets, impairment, and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis. As noted by NAREIT in its December 2018 NAREIT Funds from Operations White Paper 2018 Restatement, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. We believe NAREIT FFO provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs. Our presentation may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the terms in accordance with the current NAREIT definition, or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during a given operating period. We also present Adjusted FFO attributable to stockholders and Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance and in our annual budget process. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor complete understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO attributable to stockholders for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO attributable to stockholders: Gains or losses on foreign currency transactions; Transition expense related to our establishment as an independent, publicly traded company; Transaction costs associated with hotel acquisition or disposition costs expensed during the period; Severance expense; Share-based compensation expense; Casualty gains or losses; Litigation gains and losses outside the ordinary course of business; and Other items that we believe are not representative of our current or future operating performance. 53 The following table provides a reconciliation of net income attributable to stockholders to NAREIT FFO attributable to stockholders and Adjusted FFO attributable to stockholders: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) Net income attributable to stockholders $ 472 $ 2,625 $ 133 Depreciation and amortization expense 277 288 300 Depreciation and amortization expense attributable to noncontrolling interests (4 ) (3 ) (3 ) Gain on sales of assets, net (96 ) (1 ) (1 ) Gain on sale of investments in affiliates (1) (107 ) Impairment loss 10 15 Equity investment adjustments: Equity in earnings from investments in affiliates (18 ) (40 ) (3 ) Pro rata FFO of investments in affiliates 34 52 35 NAREIT FFO attributable to stockholders 558 2,931 476 Loss (gain) on foreign currency transactions 3 4 (3 ) Casualty (gain) loss, net (1 ) 16 Transition expense 3 9 26 Transaction expense 2 2 Severance expense 2 1 Share-based compensation expense 16 14 Other items (2) 20 (2,381 ) 23 Adjusted FFO attributable to stockholders $ 603 $ 596 $ 522 NAREIT FFO per share - Diluted (3) $ 2.73 $ 13.67 $ 2.41 Adjusted FFO per share - Diluted (3) $ 2.96 $ 2.78 $ 2.64 (1) Included in other gain (loss), net . (2) For 2018, includes $13 million of income tax expense, primarily attributable to an additional built-in gain deferred tax liability as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which prohibits the sale of ancillary hotel furniture, fixtures and equipment to be included in a like-kind exchange. For 2017, includes $18 million in distributions received from investments in affiliates, net of $7 million of income tax expense, in excess of the investment balance that were included within equity in earnings from investments in affiliates in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and derecognition and remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $2,347 million associated with our intent to elect REIT status. In addition, we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $25 million associated with the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 21% as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For 2016, represents costs incurred and accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees on extinguished debt. (3) For 2016, per share amounts were calculated using the number of shares of common stock outstanding upon the completion of the spin-off. Per share amounts are calculated based on unrounded numbers and are calculated independently for each period presented. Comparable Hotel Data Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017 The following table sets forth data for our 2018 comparable hotels by geographic market as of December 31, 2018 and 2017: As of December 31, 2018 Year Ended December 31, 2018 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Percent Change in Market No. of Hotels No. of Rooms ADR Occupancy RevPAR ADR Occupancy RevPAR RevPAR Hawaii 1 2,860 $ 259.17 94.0 % $ 243.56 $ 258.09 93.9 % $ 242.38 0.5 % Northern California 6 4,279 249.39 87.0 216.96 237.79 84.8 201.60 7.6 Florida 6 3,294 214.33 80.5 172.57 205.47 81.8 168.16 2.6 Other 14 5,373 168.07 77.7 130.61 165.51 78.1 129.32 1.0 New Orleans 2 1,939 177.37 75.3 133.64 177.12 73.2 129.71 3.0 Chicago 4 2,743 184.19 76.9 141.70 176.64 75.4 133.17 6.4 New York 1 1,878 293.08 88.7 259.93 294.32 87.1 256.33 1.4 Southern California 4 1,304 174.01 83.1 144.53 168.65 84.8 142.88 1.2 Washington, D.C. 3 1,282 179.10 76.7 137.36 182.64 79.2 144.67 (5.1 ) Total Domestic 41 24,952 $ 214.00 82.3 % $ 176.17 $ 209.19 81.8 % $ 171.48 2.7 % Total International 3 783 $ 156.33 73.1 % $ 114.32 $ 146.02 69.2 % $ 101.04 13.1 % All Markets 44 25,735 $ 212.44 82.0 % $ 174.29 $ 207.56 81.5 % $ 169.34 2.9 % 54 Our comparable hotels experienced RevPAR growth of 2.9%, primarily attributable to an increase in ADR of 2.4%. The overall increase in RevPAR was primarily a result of increases in ADR and occupancy at our Northern California and Chicago hotels from an increase in group business of 15.6% and an increase in contract business of 41.7% at our San Francisco hotels, coupled with an increase in group business of 10.3% at the Hilton Chicago. Additionally, RevPAR at our Florida hotels increased primarily due to an increase in occupancy and ADR in our Key West hotels that were closed during a portion of September and October 2017 following Hurricane Irma. RevPAR increased at our New Orleans hotels as a result of an increase in transient business at the Hilton New Orleans Riverside. The overall increase in RevPAR for our comparable hotels was partially offset by declines in RevPAR in our Washington D.C. hotels due to a decrease in group business. Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2016 The following table sets forth data for our 2017 comparable hotels by geographic market as of December 31, 2017 and 2016: As of December 31, 2017 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Year Ended December 31, 2016 Market No. of Hotels No. of Rooms ADR Occupancy RevPAR ADR Occupancy RevPAR Percent Change in RevPAR Hawaii 1 2,860 $ 258.09 93.9 % $ 242.38 $ 248.81 94.6 % $ 235.47 2.9 % Northern California 7 4,513 234.61 84.8 199.04 234.93 85.5 200.79 (0.9 )% Florida 6 3,294 205.47 81.8 168.16 203.50 80.5 163.81 2.7 % Other 16 5,803 163.50 77.9 127.34 157.55 77.7 122.38 4.1 % New Orleans 2 1,939 177.12 73.2 129.71 178.18 74.7 133.10 (2.5 )% Chicago 4 2,743 176.64 75.4 133.17 181.86 74.6 135.75 (1.9 )% New York 1 1,907 294.32 87.1 256.33 296.13 89.1 263.72 (2.8 )% Southern California 4 1,304 168.65 84.7 142.88 167.75 85.5 143.43 (0.4 )% Washington, D.C. 2 1,085 171.47 78.2 134.02 163.68 79.2 129.70 3.3 % Total Domestic 43 25,448 $ 207.52 81.9 % $ 169.88 $ 205.46 82.1 % $ 168.69 0.7 % Total International 12 2,699 $ 139.40 74.0 % $ 103.17 $ 138.94 73.4 % $ 102.05 1.1 % All Markets 55 28,147 $ 201.56 81.1 % $ 163.49 $ 199.70 81.3 % $ 162.30 0.7 % Our domestic hotels experienced RevPAR growth of 0.7%, primarily attributable to an increase in ADR of 1.0%. Our Hawaii hotel led RevPAR growth with an increase in ADR from increased group demand. RevPAR at our Florida hotels increased primarily due to an increase in occupancy from both group and transient business. Our Washington D.C. hotels experienced an increase in ADR of 4.8% due to increased demand during the inauguration and related political events in the first quarter. The overall increase in RevPAR at our domestic hotels was partially offset by declines in RevPAR in our New York, Chicago, New Orleans, and Northern California hotels. Our New York hotel experienced a decline in RevPAR, attributable to declines in occupancy and ADR, mainly resulting from disruptions from renovations during the year coupled with reduced demand. Chicago experienced a decline in RevPAR primarily attributable to a decline in ADR from a decrease in both group and transient business. Our New Orleans hotels experienced a decline in RevPAR due to the effects of Hurricane Harvey coupled with a decrease in group business. Northern California experienced an overall decline in RevPAR, attributable to lower ADR and occupancy as a result of decreased demand in 2017 associated with the renovations at the Moscone Convention Center, the Super Bowl taking place in San Francisco in February 2016, disruption from renovation of rooms during the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by increased group and transient demand in the second half of 2017. Results of Operations The following items have had a significant effect on the year-over-year comparability of our operations and are further discussed in the sections below: Property Dispositions: During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 12 consolidated hotels and one hotel owned by unconsolidated affiliates. Refer to Note 3: Dispositions and Assets Held for Sale in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Additionally, the results of operations during our period of ownership of the sold consolidated hotels are included within non-comparable revenues and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Hurricane Maria: As a result of Hurricane Maria in September 2017, the Caribe Hilton sustained significant damage and was closed for the remainder of 2017 and all of 2018. While the results of operations are included within non-comparable revenues and operating expenses, the closure has resulted in a reduction in hotel revenues and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, as well as the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. 55 Revenue Rooms Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2018 (1) 2017 (1) Percent Change 2017 (2) 2016 (2) Percent Change (in millions) (in millions) Comparable rooms revenue $ 1,637 $ 1,595 2.6 % $ 1,680 $ 1,672 0.5 % Non-comparable rooms revenue 79 199 (60.3 ) 114 123 (7.3 ) Total rooms revenue $ 1,716 $ 1,794 (4.3 )% $ 1,794 $ 1,795 (0.1 )% (1) Based on our 2018 comparable hotels as of December 31, 2018.

(3) During 2016, we repaid in full the 2013 CMBS loan ( Existing CMBS Loan ). Interest expense on the Term Loan increased $7 million in 2018 primarily as a result of an increase in the one-month LIBOR of approximately 100 basis points during 2018. Other interest expense decreased $5 million in 2018 as a result of the repayment of $55 million of unsecured notes in December 2017. In connection with the spin-off, we refinanced certain of our outstanding debt, resulting in a decrease in interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016. Our current debt outstanding is approximately $3.0 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 4.1%, of which approximately 74% is fixed-rate debt, refer to Item 7A: Interest Rate Risk in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Equity in earnings from investments in affiliates The $22 million decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 was due to an $18 million distribution in excess of the investment carrying amount of one of our unconsolidated affiliates that was received in 2017. The $37 million increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to the $18 million distribution in excess of the investment carrying amount of one of our unconsolidated affiliates received in 2017. Additionally, in 2016, we recognized an impairment loss of $17 million related to one of our investments in affiliates. Other gain (loss), net During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a net gain of $102 million, which is primarily due to the sale of our interests in the unconsolidated affiliates that owned the Hilton Berlin. Refer to Note 3: Dispositions and Assets Held for Sale in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. In 2016, we recognized a net loss primarily as a result of the recognition of $19 million in remaining deferred financing costs associated with the debt payoff of the Existing CMBS Loan, which was fully repaid in December 2016.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized an income tax benefit of $2,351 million as a result of the derecognition and re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $25 million associated with the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 21% as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The income tax benefit was partially offset by current income tax expense associated with our taxable REIT subsidiaries and foreign operations of $32 million. Prior to January 4, 2017, we were included in the Hilton tax group and subject to corporate income taxes at an effective U.S. federal, state and foreign tax rate of approximately 39%. Refer to Note 10: Income Taxes in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under our revolving credit facility ( Revolver ) and issuing securities. As of December 31, 2018, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $425 million, including $15 million of restricted cash. Restricted cash consists of cash restricted as to use by our debt agreements. In addition, we had $1 billion of available capacity remaining under our Revolver and the ability to raise capital through the issuance of securities under our shelf-registration statement on Form S-3. Our known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures, including reimbursements to our hotel manager for payroll and related benefits, costs associated with the operation of our hotels, interest and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures for renovations and maintenance at our hotels, and dividends to our stockholders. Our long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities, capital improvements at our hotels, and costs associated with potential acquisitions. Our commitments to fund capital expenditures for renovations and maintenance at our hotels will be funded by cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash to the extent permitted by our lending agreements and cash flow from operations. We have established reserves for capital expenditures ( FF&E reserve ) in accordance with our management and certain debt agreements. Generally, these agreements require that we fund 4% of hotel revenues into a FF&E reserve, unless such amounts have been incurred. We finance our business activities primarily with existing cash and cash generated from our operations, and if necessary, short-term borrowing under our Revolver or proceeds from public offerings of other securities. We believe that this cash will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for operating expenses and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. Our cash management objectives are to maintain the availability of liquidity, minimize operational costs, make debt payments and fund our capital expenditure programs and future acquisitions. Further, we have an investment policy that is focused on the preservation of capital and maximizing the return on new and existing investments. Sources and Uses of Our Cash and Cash Equivalents The following tables summarize our net cash flows and key metrics related to our liquidity: Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 444 $ 653 $ 399 (32.0 )% 63.7 % Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 419 (165 ) (224 ) NM (1) (26.3 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (816 ) (459 ) 29 NM (1) NM (1) (1) Percentage change is not meaningful. Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities are primarily generated from the operating income generated at our hotels. 61 The $209 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to a $47 million increase in cash paid for income taxes. This was coupled with decreases in w orking capital resulting from the timing of receipts from our customers and payments to our vendors and other third parties. The $254 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a $51 million decrease in cash paid for interest and a $130 million decrease in income tax payments. Additionally, the change was due to the timing of payments to our hotel manager, resulting in a $50 million increase, and the timing of payments to our vendors, resulting in a $20 million increase. Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by investing activities of $419 million was primarily attributable to $519 million in net proceeds from the sale of 13 hotels and $88 million of insurance proceeds received for property damage claims; refer to Note 3: Dispositions and Assets Held for Sale and Note 4: Property and Equipment in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. This amount was offset by $188 million of capital expenditures for property and equipment at our hotels. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, net cash used in investing activities of $165 million and $224 million, respectively, consisted primarily of capital expenditures for property and equipment at our hotels. Capital expenditures in 2017 were offset by a $19 million distribution from unconsolidated affiliates representing returns of our investments. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in financing activities of $816 million is primarily attributable to the repurchase of 14,000,000 shares of our common stock for $348 million and $464 million of dividends paid. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in financing activities of $459 million primarily consisted of $386 million of dividends paid and the repayment of our secured notes of $55 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we received $847 million from Parent, net of distributions and including $40 million in net transfers, which was used to make net repayments of $786 million of debt. Dividends As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain, to our stockholders on an annual basis. Therefore, as a general matter, it is unlikely that we will be able to retain substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs from our annual taxable income. Instead, we will need to meet these needs from external sources of capital and amounts, if any, by which our cash flow generated from operations exceeds taxable income. We declared the following dividends to holders of our common stock during 2018: Record Date Payment Date Dividend per Share March 30, 2018 April 16, 2018 $ 0.43 June 29, 2018 July 16, 2018 $ 0.43 June 29, 2018 July 16, 2018 (1) $ 0.45 September 28, 2018 October 15, 2018 $ 0.43 December 31, 2018 January 15, 2019 (2) $ 1.00 (1) We utilized a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the Hilton Berlin to declare a special cash dividend of $0.45 per share, or approximately $90 million. (2) Of the full $1.00 per share payment, $0.70 per share represented the fourth quarter payment based on 2018 results of operations. The remaining $0.30 per share was attributable to gains from the sale of our assets during 2018. Debt As of December 31, 2018, our total indebtedness was approximately $3 billion, excluding approximately $233 million of our share of debt of investments in affiliates. Substantially all the debt of such unconsolidated affiliates is secured solely by the affiliates assets or is guaranteed by other partners without recourse to us. Refer to Note 7: Debt in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 62 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018: Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years (in millions) Debt (1)(2) $ 3,678 $ 122 $ 1,006 $ 939 $ 1,611 Operating leases (3) 355 27 56 49 223 Total contractual obligations $ 4,033 $ 149 $ 1,062 $ 988 $ 1,834 (1) Assumes the exercise of all extensions that are exercisable solely at our option. (2) Includes principal, as well as estimated interest payments. For our variable-rate debt, we have assumed a constant 30-day LIBOR rate of 2.52% as of December 31, 2018. (3) Only includes our future minimum lease payments, refer to Note 9: Leases in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2018 included construction contract commitments of approximately $34 million for capital expenditures at our properties. Our contracts contain clauses that allow us to cancel all or some portion of the work. If cancellation of a contract occurred, our commitment would be any costs incurred up to the cancellation date, in addition to any costs associated with the discharge of the contract. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in our historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment, and the estimates required to be made were based on assumptions that are inherently uncertain. As a result, these accounting policies could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to reflect the current circumstances. While we believe our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments, assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise, which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. Acquisitions We evaluate each of our acquisitions to determine if it is as an asset acquisition or a business combination. An asset acquisition occurs when substantially all the fair value of an acquisition is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. In an acquisition of assets, the total cash consideration, including transaction costs is allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed, respectively, on a relative fair value ba sis. In a business combination, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at fair value. We evaluate several factors, including market data for similar assets, expected future cash flows discounted at risk-adjusted rates and replacement cost for the assets to determine an appropriate fair value of the assets. Changes to these factors could affect the measurement of assets and liabilities. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets with Finite Lives We evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the assets if we determine there are indicators of potential impairment. If it is determined that the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets, the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income as an impairment loss. As part of the process described above, we exercise judgment to: 63 determine if there are indicators of impairment present. Factors we consider when making this determination include assessing the overall effect of trends in the hospitality industry and the general economy, historical experience, capital costs and other asset-specific information; determine the projected undiscounted future cash flows when indicators of impairment are present. Judgment is required when developing projections of future revenues and expenses based on estimated growth rates over the expected useful life of the asset group. These estimated growth rates are based on historical operating results, as well as various internal projections and external sources; and determine the asset fair value when required. In determining the fair value, we often use internally-developed discounted cash flow models. Assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models include estimating cash flows, which may require us to adjust for specific market conditions, as well as capitalization rates, which are based on location, property or asset type, market-specific dynamics and overall economic performance. The discount rate takes into account our weighted average cost of capital according to our capital structure and other market specific considerations. Changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives could result in future impairment losses, which could be material. We did not identify any additional property and equipment or intangible assets with finite lives with indicators of impairment for which an additional 10% change in our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows or other significant assumptions would result in material impairment losses. Assets Held for Sale We classify a property as held for sale when we commit to a plan to sell the asset, the sale of the asset is probable within one year, and it is unlikely that action to complete the sale will change or that the sale will be withdrawn. When we determine that classification of an asset as held for sale is appropriate, we cease recording depreciation for the asset and value the property at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value, less costs to dispose. Further, the related assets and liabilities of the held for sale property will be classified as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets. Any gains on sales of properties are recognized at the time of sale or deferred and recognized in net income (loss) in subsequent periods as any relevant conditions requiring deferral are satisfied. Investments in Affiliates We evaluate our investments in affiliates for impairment when there are indicators that the fair value of our investment may be less than our carrying value. We record an impairment loss when we determine there has been an other-than-temporary decline in the investment fair value. If an identified event or change in circumstances requires an evaluation to determine if the value of an investment may have an other-than-temporary decline, we assess the fair value of the investment based on the accepted valuation methods, which include discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and external appraisals. If an investment fair value is below its carrying value and the decline is considered to be other-than-temporary, we will recognize an impairment loss in equity in earnings (losses) from investments in affiliates for equity method investments in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Our investments in affiliates consist primarily of our interests in entities that own or lease properties. As such, the factors we consider when determining if there are indicators of potential impairment are similar to property and equipment discussed above. If there are indicators of potential impairment, we estimate the fair value of our equity method and cost method investments by internally developed discounted cash flow models. The principal factors used in our discounted cash flow models that require judgment are the same as the items discussed in property and equipment above. Changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of investments in affiliates could result in future impairment losses, which could be material. We did not identify any additional investments in affiliates with indicators of impairment for which a 10% change in our estimates of future cash flows or other significant assumptions would result in material impairment losses. Goodwill We review the carrying value of our goodwill by comparing the carrying values of our reportable units to their fair values. Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as described in Note 15: Geographic and Business Segment Information . We perform this evaluation annually or at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist. In any given year we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we cannot determine qualitatively that the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, or we decide to bypass the qualitative assessment, we proceed to the two-step quantitative process. In the first step, we evaluate the fair value of our reporting unit quantitatively. When determining fair value, we utilize discounted future cash flow models, as well as market conditions relative to the 64 operations of our reporting unit. When using a discounted cash flow approach, we utilize various assumptions that require judgment, including projections o f revenues and expenses based on estimated long-term growth rates, and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital. Our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, as well as various internal projections and external sources. The weighted average cost of capital is estimated based on the reporting units cost of debt and equity and a selected capital structure. The selected capital structure for the reporting unit is based on consideration of capital structures of comp arable publicly traded REITs. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step must be performed. In the second step, we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill, which is determined by taking the fair value of the reporting unit and allocating it to all of its assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment testing could result in future impairment losses, which could be material. A change in our estimates and assumptions that would reduce the fair value of our reporting units by 10% would not result in an impairment. Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. In relation to our deferred tax liabilities, to the extent we dispose of hotels we owned as of the date of spin-off within a five-year period, we would be subject to income tax on any gain on sale, to the extent the gain existed as of the date of the spin-off ( built-in-gain ). Each period we are required to assess our intent and ability to hold or dispose of hotels that had built-in-gains as of the spin-off, as well as the fair value of those hotels relative to the fair value at the spin-off. Changes in these assumptions could result in an increase or decrease in our deferred tax liabilities associated with built-in-gains. We use a prescribed more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements. Assumptions and estimates are used to determine the more-likely-than-not designation. Changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax expense (benefit), which can materially change our consolidated financial statements. Consolidations We use judgment when evaluating whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity, including the assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights, as well as financial interests in an entity that are not controllable through voting interests. If the entity is considered to be a variable interest entity ( VIE ), we use judgment determining whether we are the primary beneficiary, and then consolidate those VIEs for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary. If the entity in which we hold an interest does not meet the definition of a VIE, we evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest through our voting interest in the entity. Changes to judgments used in evaluating our partnerships and other investments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.
