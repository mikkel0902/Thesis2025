Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW We are one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States. As of December 31, 2018 we owned and operated 97 new vehicle franchises ( 83 dealership locations), representing 29 brands of automobiles, and 25 collision centers, in 17 metropolitan markets, within nine states. Our stores offer an extensive range of automotive products and services, including new and used vehicles; parts and service, which include repair and maintenance services, replacement parts, and collision repair service; and finance and insurance products. As of December 31, 2018 , our new vehicle revenue brand mix consisted of 47% imports, 33% luxury, and 20% domestic brands. Our revenues are derived primarily from: (i) the sale of new vehicles; (ii) the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers ("used retail") and to other dealers at auction ("wholesale") (the terms "used retail" and "wholesale" collectively referred to as "used"); (iii) repair and maintenance services, including collision repair, the sale of automotive replacement parts, and the reconditioning of used vehicles (collectively referred to as "parts and service"); and (iv) the arrangement of third-party vehicle financing and the sale of a number of vehicle protection products (defined below and collectively referred to as "F&I"). We evaluate the results of our new and used vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle sold, our parts and service operations based on aggregate gross profit, and our F&I business based on F&I gross profit per vehicle sold. Our continued organic growth is dependent upon the execution of our balanced automotive retailing and service business strategy, the continued strength of our brand mix, and the production and allocation of desirable vehicles from the automobile manufacturers whose brands we sell. Our vehicle sales have historically fluctuated with product availability as well as local and national economic conditions, including consumer confidence, availability of consumer credit, fuel prices, and employment levels. Additionally, our ability to sell certain new and used vehicles can be negatively impacted by a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control and may include manufacturer imposed stop-sales or open safety recalls, primarily due to, but not limited to, vehicle safety concerns or a vehicle's failure to meet environmental related requirements. Further, governmental actions, such as changes in, or the imposition of, tariffs or trade restrictions on imported goods, may adversely affect vehicle sales and depress demand. However, we believe that the impact on our business of any future negative trends in new vehicle sales would be partially mitigated by (i) the expected relative stability of our parts and service operations over the long-term, (ii) the variable nature of significant components of our cost structure, and (iii) our diversified brand and geographic mix. The seasonally adjusted annual rate ("SAAR") of new vehicle sales in the U.S. during 2018 was 17.3 million compared to 17.2 million in 2017 . The automotive retail business continues to benefit from the availability of credit to consumers, strong consumer confidence and historically low unemployment levels. Demand for new vehicles is generally highest during the second, third, and fourth quarters of each year and, accordingly, we expect our revenues to generally be higher during these periods. We typically experience higher sales of luxury vehicles in the fourth quarter, which have higher average selling prices and gross profit per vehicle retailed. Revenues and operating results may be impacted significantly from quarter-to-quarter by changing economic conditions, vehicle manufacturer incentive programs, adverse weather events, or other developments outside our control. Our gross profit margin varies with our revenue mix. Sales of new vehicles generally result in a lower gross profit margin than used vehicle sales, sales of parts and service, and sales of F&I products. As a result, when used vehicle, parts and service, and F&I revenue increase as a percentage of total revenue, we expect our overall gross profit margin to increase. Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses consist primarily of fixed and incentive-based compensation, advertising, rent, insurance, utilities, and other customary operating expenses. A significant portion of our cost structure is variable (such as sales commissions), or controllable (such as advertising), which we believe allows us to adapt to changes in the retail environment over the long-term. We evaluate commissions paid to salespeople as a percentage of retail vehicle gross profit, advertising expense on a per vehicle retailed ("PVR") basis, and all other SG&A expenses in the aggregate as a percentage of total gross profit. We had total available liquidity of $356.1 million as of December 31, 2018 , which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $8.3 million , $32.2 million of funds in our floor plan offset accounts, $190.0 million of availability under our new vehicle floor plan facility that is able to be re-designated to our revolving credit facility, $47.0 million of availability under our revolving credit facility, and $78.6 million of availability under our used vehicle revolving floor plan facility. For further discussion of our liquidity, please refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. 30 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions, that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates their estimates and assumptions and the effects of any such revisions are reflected in the financial statements, in the period in which they are determined to be necessary. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and understanding our results of operations, based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application. Goodwill and Manufacturer Franchise Rights Goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquired business over the fair market value of its identifiable assets and liabilities. We have determined that, based on how we integrate acquisitions into our business, how the components of our business share resources and interact with one another, and how we review the results of our operations, that we have several geographic market-based operating segments. We have determined that the dealerships in each of our operating segments are components that are aggregated into several geographic market-based reporting units for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, as they (i) have similar economic characteristics, (ii) offer similar products and services (all of our franchised dealerships offer new and used vehicles, parts and service, and arrange for third-party vehicle financing and the sale of insurance products), (iii) have similar customers, (iv) have similar distribution and marketing practices (all of our dealerships distribute products and services through dealership facilities that market to customers in similar ways) and (v) operate under similar regulatory environments. Our only significant identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill, are our rights under franchise agreements with manufacturers, which are recorded at an individual franchise level. The fair value of our manufacturer franchise rights are determined at the acquisition date, by discounting the projected cash flows specific to each franchise. We have determined that manufacturer franchise rights have an indefinite life as there are no economic, contractual or other factors that limit their useful lives, and they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely due to the historically long lives of the manufacturers' brand names. Furthermore, to the extent that any agreements evidencing our manufacturer franchise rights would expire, we expect that we would be able to renew those agreements in the ordinary course of business. We performed quantitative franchise rights impairment tests as of October 1, 2018, and identified three dealerships with franchise rights carrying values that exceeded their fair values, and as a result, recorded non-cash impairment charges of $3.7 million. We do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives. We review goodwill and manufacturer franchise rights for impairment annually as of October 1 st , or more often if events or circumstances indicate that any impairment may have occurred. We are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill becomes impaired due to decreases in the fair value of our automotive retail business or manufacturer franchise rights become impaired due to decreases in the fair value of our individual franchises. F&I Chargeback Reserves We receive commissions from third-party lending and insurance institutions for arranging customer financing and from the sale of vehicle service contracts, guaranteed auto protection (known as "GAP") insurance, and other insurance to customers (collectively "F&I"). F&I commissions are recorded at the time the associated vehicle is sold. We may be charged back for F&I commissions in the event a contract is prepaid, defaulted upon, or terminated ("chargebacks"). F&I commissions, net of estimated future chargebacks, are included in Finance and Insurance, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. We reserve for chargebacks on finance, insurance, or vehicle service contract commissions received. The reserve is established based on historical operating results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts and is evaluated on a product-by-product basis. Our F&I cash chargebacks for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 were $37.5 million, $34.0 million, and $34.9 million, respectively. Our chargeback reserves were $44.2 million and $43.7 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , respectively. Total chargebacks as a percentage of F&I commissions for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , were 13%, 12%, and 14%, respectively. A 100 basis point change in our estimated reserve rate for future chargebacks, would change our finance and insurance chargeback reserve by approximately $3.1 million as of December 31, 2018 . 31 Table of Contents Insurance Reserves We are self-insured for employee medical claims and maintain stop loss insurance for large-dollar individual claims. We have large deductible insurance programs for workers compensation, property and general liability claims. We maintain and review our claim and loss history to assist in assessing our expected future liability for these claims. We also use professional service providers, such as account administrators and actuaries, to help us accumulate and assess this information. Provisions for retained losses and deductibles are made by charges to expense based upon periodic evaluations of the estimated ultimate liabilities on reported and unreported claims. We had $16.5 million and $15.7 million of insurance reserves for incurred and expected employee medical, workers compensation, property, and general liability claims, net of anticipated insurance recoveries, as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , respectively. Expenses associated with employee medical, workers compensation, property, and general liability claims, including premiums for insurance coverage, for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , totaled $29.9 million, $27.9 million, and $30.9 million, respectively. 32 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017 For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2018 2017 (Dollars in millions, except per share data) REVENUE: New vehicle $ 3,788.7 $ 3,561.1 $ 227.6 6 % Used vehicle 1,972.4 1,834.1 138.3 8 % Parts and service 821.0 786.1 34.9 4 % Finance and insurance, net 292.3 275.2 17.1 6 % TOTAL REVENUE 6,874.4 6,456.5 417.9 6 % GROSS PROFIT: New vehicle 165.2 169.0 (3.8 ) (2 )% Used vehicle 129.7 121.9 7.8 6 % Parts and service 515.8 489.8 26.0 5 % Finance and insurance, net 292.3 275.2 17.1 6 % TOTAL GROSS PROFIT 1,103.0 1,055.9 47.1 4 % OPERATING EXPENSES: Selling, general, and administrative 755.8 729.7 26.1 4 % Depreciation and amortization 33.7 32.1 1.6 5 % Franchise rights impairment 3.7 5.1 (1.4 ) (27 )% Other operating (income) expenses, net (1.1 ) 1.3 (2.4 ) (185 )% INCOME FROM OPERATIONS 310.9 287.7 23.2 8 % OTHER EXPENSES: Floor plan interest expense 32.5 22.7 9.8 43 % Other interest expense, net 53.1 53.9 (0.8 ) (1 )% Swap interest expense 0.5 2.0 (1.5 ) (75 )% Total other expenses, net 86.1 78.6 7.5 10 % INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 224.8 209.1 15.7 8 % Income tax expense 56.8 70.0 (13.2 ) (19 )% NET INCOME $ 168.0 $ 139.1 $ 28.9 21 % Net income per common share Diluted $ 8.28 $ 6.62 $ 1.66 25 % 33 Table of Contents For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 REVENUE MIX PERCENTAGES: New vehicles 55.1 % 55.2 % Used retail vehicles 25.9 % 25.2 % Used vehicle wholesale 2.8 % 3.1 % Parts and service 11.9 % 12.2 % Finance and insurance, net 4.3 % 4.3 % Total revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % GROSS PROFIT MIX PERCENTAGES: New vehicles 15.0 % 16.0 % Used retail vehicles 11.5 % 11.4 % Used vehicle wholesale 0.2 % 0.1 % Parts and service 46.8 % 46.4 % Finance and insurance, net 26.5 % 26.1 % Total gross profit 100.0 % 100.0 % GROSS PROFIT MARGIN 16.0 % 16.4 % SG&A EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS PROFIT 68.5 % 69.1 % Total revenue during 2018 increase d by $417.9 million ( 6% ) compared to 2017 , due to a $227.6 million ( 6% ) increase in new vehicle revenue, a $138.3 million ( 8% ) increase in used vehicle revenue, a $34.9 million ( 4% ) increase in parts and service revenue and a $17.1 million ( 6% ) increase in F&I revenue. The $47.1 million ( 4% ) increase in gross profit during 2018 was the result of a $7.8 million ( 6% ) increase in used vehicle gross profit, a $17.1 million ( 6% ) increase in F&I revenue and a $26.0 million ( 5% ) increase in parts and service gross profit, partially offset by a $3.8 million ( 2% ) decrease in new vehicle gross profit. Our total gross profit margin decreased 40 basis points from 16.4% in 2017 to 16.0% in 2018, primarily due to margin pressure in our new vehicle and used vehicle business lines. Income from operations during 2018 increase d by $23.2 million ( 8% ) compared to 2017 , primarily due to a $47.1 million increase in gross profit and a $2.4 million decrease in other operating (income) expense, net, partially offset by a $26.1 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $1.6 million ( 5% ) increase in depreciation and amortization expenses. Total other expenses, net increased by $7.5 million in 2018 , primarily due to a $9.8 million increase in floor plan interest expense in 2018 , partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in swap interest expense and a $0.8 million decrease in other interest expense, net. As a result, income before income taxes increase d by $15.7 million ( 8% ) to $224.8 million in 2018 . The $13.2 million ( 19% ) decrease in income tax expense was primarily attributable to the decrease in our effective tax rate from 33.5% in 2017 to 25.3% for 2018. Overall, net income increase d by $28.9 million ( 21% ) from $139.1 million in 2017 to $168.0 million in 2018 . On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of that date and recognized a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. Our prior period comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under accounting standards in effect for those periods. The net impact of adopting ASC 606 for the year ended December 31, 2018 was a decrease to net income of $0.1 million. For additional information related to the adoption effects of this new revenue recognition standard, please refer to Note 2 "Revenue Recognition" within the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We assess the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit on a same store basis. We believe that our assessment on a same store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial performance and provides relevant information to assess our performance. As such, for the following discussion, same store amounts consist of information from dealerships for identical months in each comparative period, commencing with the first month we owned the dealership. Additionally, amounts related to divested dealerships are excluded from each comparative period. 34 Table of Contents New Vehicle For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2018 2017 (Dollars in millions, except for per vehicle data) As Reported: Revenue: Luxury $ 1,235.3 $ 1,200.2 $ 35.1 3 % Import 1,790.2 1,637.4 152.8 9 % Domestic 763.2 723.5 39.7 5 % Total new vehicle revenue $ 3,788.7 $ 3,561.1 $ 227.6 6 % Gross profit: Luxury $ 80.0 $ 78.9 $ 1.1 1 % Import 52.6 56.8 (4.2 ) (7 )% Domestic 32.6 33.3 (0.7 ) (2 )% Total new vehicle gross profit $ 165.2 $ 169.0 $ (3.8 ) (2 )% New vehicle units: Luxury 22,979 22,525 454 2 % Import 62,939 58,685 4,254 7 % Domestic 19,357 18,765 592 3 % Total new vehicle units 105,275 99,975 5,300 5 % Same Store: Revenue: Luxury $ 1,235.3 $ 1,200.2 $ 35.1 3 % Import 1,706.7 1,636.2 70.5 4 % Domestic 740.3 722.2 18.1 3 % Total new vehicle revenue $ 3,682.3 $ 3,558.6 $ 123.7 3 % Gross profit: Luxury $ 80.0 $ 78.9 $ 1.1 1 % Import 49.7 56.7 (7.0 ) (12 )% Domestic 31.7 33.2 (1.5 ) (5 )% Total new vehicle gross profit $ 161.4 $ 168.8 $ (7.4 ) (4 )% New vehicle units: Luxury 22,979 22,525 454 2 % Import 60,010 58,648 1,362 2 % Domestic 18,676 18,727 (51 ) % Total new vehicle units 101,665 99,900 1,765 2 % 35 Table of Contents New Vehicle Metrics For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2018 2017 As Reported: Revenue per new vehicle sold $ 35,989 $ 35,620 $ 369 1 % Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 1,569 $ 1,690 $ (121 ) (7 )% New vehicle gross margin 4.4 % 4.7 % (0.3 )% Luxury: Gross profit per new vehicle sold 3,481 3,503 (22 ) (1 )% New vehicle gross margin 6.5 % 6.6 % (0.1 )% Import: Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 836 $ 968 $ (132 ) (14 )% New vehicle gross margin 2.9 % 3.5 % (0.6 )% Domestic: Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 1,684 $ 1,775 $ (91 ) (5 )% New vehicle gross margin 4.3 % 4.6 % (0.3 )% Same Store: Revenue per new vehicle sold $ 36,220 $ 35,622 $ 598 2 % Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 1,588 $ 1,690 $ (102 ) (6 )% New vehicle gross margin 4.4 % 4.7 % (0.3 )% Luxury: Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 3,481 $ 3,503 $ (22 ) (1 )% New vehicle gross margin 6.5 % 6.6 % (0.1 )% Import: Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 828 $ 967 $ (139 ) (14 )% New vehicle gross margin 2.9 % 3.5 % (0.6 )% Domestic: Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 1,697 $ 1,773 $ (76 ) (4 )% New vehicle gross margin 4.3 % 4.6 % (0.3 )% New vehicle revenue increase d by $227.6 million ( 6% ), primarily as a result of a 5% increase in new vehicle units sold and a 1% increase in revenue per new vehicle sold. Same store new vehicle revenue increase d by $123.7 million ( 3% ) as a result of increase s in new vehicle units and revenue per new vehicle sold. The 2% increase in same store unit sales volume was driven by a 2% increase in both luxury and import units. The 2 % increase in same store unit sales slightly exceeded 2018 U.S. new vehicle sales, which increased 1% from 17.2 million in 2017 to 17.3 million in 2018 . Same store new vehicle gross profit in 2018 decrease d by $7.4 million ( 4% ), as a result of a 6% decrease in gross profit per new vehicle sold, partially offset by a 2% increase in unit volumes. The 30 basis point decrease in same store new vehicle gross margin from 4.7% in 2017 to 4.4% in 2018 , was primarily attributable to a higher mix of revenue in our import brands, which have traditionally had lower margins than our luxury and domestic brands. In addition, we attribute some of the decrease in gross profit to increased competition created by price transparency and comparability as a result of internet based research and car buying services. 36 Table of Contents Used Vehicle For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2018 2017 (Dollars in millions, except for per vehicle data) As Reported: Revenue: Used vehicle retail revenues $ 1,783.3 $ 1,635.3 $ 148.0 9 % Used vehicle wholesale revenues 189.1 198.8 (9.7 ) (5 )% Used vehicle revenue $ 1,972.4 $ 1,834.1 $ 138.3 8 % Gross profit: Used vehicle retail gross profit $ 127.8 $ 121.1 $ 6.7 6 % Used vehicle wholesale gross profit 1.9 0.8 1.1 138 % Used vehicle gross profit $ 129.7 $ 121.9 $ 7.8 6 % Used vehicle retail units: Used vehicle retail units 82,377 76,929 5,448 7 % Same Store: Revenue: Used vehicle retail revenues $ 1,737.2 $ 1,625.0 $ 112.2 7 % Used vehicle wholesale revenues 185.8 197.7 (11.9 ) (6 )% Used vehicle revenue $ 1,923.0 $ 1,822.7 $ 100.3 6 % Gross profit: Used vehicle retail gross profit $ 124.5 $ 120.4 $ 4.1 3 % Used vehicle wholesale gross profit 2.1 1.2 0.9 75 % Used vehicle gross profit $ 126.6 $ 121.6 $ 5.0 4 % Used vehicle retail units: Used vehicle retail units 79,789 76,285 3,504 5 % Used Vehicle Metrics For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2018 2017 As Reported: Revenue per used vehicle retailed $ 21,648 $ 21,257 $ 391 2 % Gross profit per used vehicle retailed $ 1,551 $ 1,574 $ (23 ) (1 )% Used vehicle retail gross margin 7.2 % 7.4 % (0.2 )% Same Store: Revenue per used vehicle retailed $ 21,772 $ 21,302 $ 470 2 % Gross profit per used vehicle retailed $ 1,560 $ 1,578 $ (18 ) (1 )% Used vehicle retail gross margin 7.2 % 7.4 % (0.2 )% Used vehicle revenue increase d by $138.3 million ( 8% ), as a result of a 7% increase in used vehicle retail units sold, and a 2% increase in revenue per used vehicle retailed. In 2018 , same store used vehicle retail gross profit increased by $4.1 million ( 3% ). Overall, our gross margin percent decreased from 7.4% in 2017 to 7.2% in 2018 . We primarily attribute the 20 basis point decrease in same store used vehicle retail gross margin to increased competition and price transparency within the used vehicle marketplace. We believe that our used vehicle inventory continues to be well-aligned with current consumer demand, with approximately 34 days of supply as of December 31, 2018 . 37 Table of Contents Parts and Service For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2018 2017 (Dollars in millions) As Reported: Parts and service revenue $ 821.0 $ 786.1 $ 34.9 4 % Parts and service gross profit: Customer pay $ 292.0 $ 272.3 $ 19.7 7 % Warranty 76.8 81.7 (4.9 ) (6 )% Wholesale parts 22.8 21.2 1.6 8 % Parts and service gross profit, excluding reconditioning and preparation $ 391.6 $ 375.2 $ 16.4 4 % Parts and service gross margin, excluding reconditioning and preparation 47.7 % 47.7 % % Reconditioning and preparation 124.2 114.6 9.6 8 % Total parts and service gross profit 515.8 489.8 26.0 5 % Total parts and service gross margin 62.8 % 62.3 % 0.5 % Same Store: Parts and service revenue $ 804.1 $ 785.6 $ 18.5 2 % Parts and service gross profit: Customer pay $ 286.2 $ 272.1 $ 14.1 5 % Warranty 75.5 81.7 (6.2 ) (8 )% Wholesale parts 22.3 21.1 1.2 6 % Parts and service gross profit, excluding reconditioning and preparation $ 384.0 $ 374.9 $ 9.1 2 % Parts and service gross margin, excluding reconditioning and preparation 47.8 % 47.7 % 0.1 % Reconditioning and preparation 121.1 114.3 6.8 6 % Total parts and service gross profit 505.1 489.2 15.9 3 % Total parts and service gross margin 62.8 % 62.3 % 0.5 % The $34.9 million ( 4% ) increase in parts and service revenue was primarily due to a $30.7 million (6%) increase in customer pay revenue and a $14.4 million (13%) increase in wholesale parts revenue, partially offset by a $10.2 million (7%) decrease in warranty revenue. Same store parts and service revenue increased $18.5 million ( 2% ) from $785.6 million in 2017 to $804.1 million in 2018 . The increase in same store parts and service revenue was due to a $20.2 million (4%) increase in customer pay revenue and a $11.1 million (10%) increase in wholesale parts revenue, partially offset by a $12.8 million (8%) decrease in warranty revenue. Parts and service gross profit, excluding reconditioning and preparation, increased by $16.4 million ( 4% ) to $391.6 million and same store gross profit, excluding reconditioning and preparation, increased by $9.1 million ( 2% ) to $384.0 million . The $9.1 million increase in same store gross profit is primarily due to a $14.1 million ( 5% ) increase in customer pay gross profit partially offset by a $6.2 million ( 8% ) decrease in warranty gross profit. We attribute the increase in same store gross profit to our continued focus on customer retention and the recent trend of increasing new vehicle sales over the past few years. We continue to focus on increasing our parts and service revenue, specifically our customer pay business, over the long-term by upgrading equipment, improving the customer experience and capitalizing on our dealership training programs.

We continued to benefit from a favorable consumer lending environment, which allowed more of our customers to take advantage of a broader array of F&I products and our continued focus on improving the F&I results at our lower-performing stores through our F&I training programs. 39 Table of Contents Selling, General, and Administrative Expense For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % of Gross Profit Increase (Decrease) 2018 % of Gross Profit 2017 % of Gross Profit (Dollars in millions) As Reported: Personnel costs $ 362.6 32.9 % $ 348.7 33.0 % $ 13.9 (0.1 )% Sales compensation 115.6 10.5 % 111.1 10.5 % 4.5 % Share-based compensation 10.5 1.0 % 13.6 1.3 % (3.1 ) (0.3 )% Outside services 83.0 7.5 % 80.8 7.7 % 2.2 (0.2 )% Advertising 30.6 2.8 % 30.3 2.9 % 0.3 (0.1 )% Rent 25.6 2.3 % 26.7 2.5 % (1.1 ) (0.2 )% Utilities 16.2 1.5 % 15.4 1.5 % 0.8 % Insurance 14.7 1.3 % 13.4 1.3 % 1.3 % Other 97.0 8.7 % 89.7 8.4 % 7.3 0.3 % Selling, general, and administrative expense $ 755.8 68.5 % $ 729.7 69.1 % $ 26.1 (0.6 )% Gross profit $ 1,103.0 $ 1,055.9 Same Store: Personnel costs $ 353.9 32.8 % $ 347.4 33.0 % $ 6.5 (0.2 )% Sales compensation 112.3 10.4 % 110.7 10.5 % 1.6 (0.1 )% Share-based compensation 10.5 1.0 % 13.6 1.3 % (3.1 ) (0.3 )% Outside services 81.1 7.5 % 80.2 7.6 % 0.9 (0.1 )% Advertising 29.1 2.7 % 30.0 2.8 % (0.9 ) (0.1 )% Rent 25.5 2.4 % 26.7 2.5 % (1.2 ) (0.1 )% Utilities 15.7 1.5 % 15.3 1.5 % 0.4 % Insurance 14.2 1.3 % 13.3 1.3 % 0.9 % Other 95.4 8.8 % 89.3 8.4 % 6.1 0.4 % Selling, general, and administrative expense $ 737.7 68.4 % $ 726.5 68.9 % $ 11.2 (0.5 )% Gross profit $ 1,078.0 $ 1,053.9 SG&A expense as a percentage of gross profit decreased 60 basis points from 69.1% in 2017 to 68.5% in 2018 . Same store SG&A expense as a percentage of gross profit decreased by 50 basis points, from 68.9% in 2017 to 68.4% in 2018 . The Company benefited from decreases in rent and share-based compensation expense on both a total company and same store basis. These decreases were partially offset by increases in other expenses including investments in our omni-channel initiatives intended to improve the customer experience and generate long-term operational efficiencies. Depreciation and Amortization Expense The $1.6 million ( 5% ) increase in depreciation and amortization expense during 2018 compared to 2017 , was primarily the result of depreciation associated with the three dealership acquisitions made in 2018, additional assets placed into service during 2017 and 2018, as well as depreciation expense associated with the purchase of previously leased properties. Franchise rights impairment We assessed our manufacturer franchise rights for impairment by comparing the present value of cash flows attributable to each franchise right to its carrying value. As a result of our impairment testing, we recognized a $3.7 million pretax non-cash charge related to three of our franchises. 40 Table of Contents Other Operating (Income) Expenses, net Other operating (income) expenses, net includes gains and losses from the sale of property and equipment, income derived from lease arrangements, and other non-core operating items. The $1.1 million in other operating income, net for 2018 , is primarily due a $0.7 million gain resulting from legal settlements and $0.4 million of other non-core operating income. The $1.3 million in Other operating expenses, net for 2017, is primarily due to recognized expenses associated with lease terminations of $3.1 million, partially offset by $0.9 million of other income, and a $0.9 million gain recognized for legal settlements. Floor Plan Interest Expense The $9.8 million ( 43% ) increase in floor plan interest expense during 2018 compared to 2017 , was primarily the result of higher interest rates throughout 2018 compared with 2017 and, to a lesser extent, higher new vehicle inventory levels. Income Tax Expense The $13.2 million ( 19% ) decrease in income tax expense was the result of a lower effective tax rate due to the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") which reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The decrease in income tax expense was partially offset by a $15.7 million ( 8% ) increase in income before income taxes. Our effective tax rate was 25.3% in 2018 compared to 33.5% in 2017 . We expect our effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26% for 2019. During the third quarter of 2018, the IRS released Notice 2018-68, which clarified a number of changes made to Section 162(m) of the Code by the Tax Act. After considering the additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, state tax authorities and other standard-setting bodies we have completed our accounting for the Tax Act.

The $2.8 million decrease in gross profit during 2017 was a result of an $18.1 million ( 10% ) decrease in new vehicle gross profit, and a $5.4 million ( 4% ) decrease in used vehicle gross profit, partially offset by a $14.2 million ( 5% ) increase in F&I gross profit, and a $6.5 million ( 1% ) increase in parts and service gross profit. Our total gross profit margin improved 20 basis points to 16.4% , primarily due to our F&I and parts and service businesses, which had higher margins than new and used vehicle sales and represented a larger percentage of our total revenue for 2017 compared to 2016 . Income from operations during 2017 decreased by $10.1 million ( 3% ) compared to 2016 , primarily due to a $5.1 million impairment charge in 2017 , a $3.6 million increase in other operating expense (income), net , and a $1.4 million ( 5% ) increase in depreciation and amortization expenses, partially offset by a $2.8 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses. Total other expenses, net increased in 2017 by $48.6 million , primarily due to a $45.5 million gain on divestitures in 2016 , a $3.4 million increase in floor plan interest expense in 2017 , and a $0.8 million increase in other interest expense, net, partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in swap interest expense. As a result, income before income taxes decreased by $58.7 million ( 22% ) to $209.1 million in 2017 resulting in a decrease in income tax expense of $30.6 million ( 30% ). Net income decreased by $28.1 million ( 17% ) from $167.2 million in 2016 to $139.1 million in 2017 . We assess the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit on a same store basis. As such, for the following discussion, same store amounts consist of information from dealerships for identical months in each comparative period, commencing with the first month we owned the dealership. Additionally, amounts related to divested dealerships are excluded from each comparative period. 43 Table of Contents New Vehicle For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2017 2016 (Dollars in millions, except for per vehicle data) As Reported: Revenue: Luxury $ 1,200.2 $ 1,251.3 $ (51.1 ) (4 )% Import 1,637.4 1,617.8 19.6 1 % Domestic 723.5 742.8 (19.3 ) (3 )% Total new vehicle revenue $ 3,561.1 $ 3,611.9 $ (50.8 ) (1 )% Gross profit: Luxury $ 78.9 $ 84.4 $ (5.5 ) (7 )% Import 56.8 68.9 (12.1 ) (18 )% Domestic 33.3 33.8 (0.5 ) (1 )% Total new vehicle gross profit $ 169.0 $ 187.1 $ (18.1 ) (10 )% New vehicle units: Luxury 22,525 23,875 (1,350 ) (6 )% Import 58,685 58,466 219 % Domestic 18,765 20,019 (1,254 ) (6 )% Total new vehicle units 99,975 102,360 (2,385 ) (2 )% Same Store: Revenue: Luxury $ 1,200.2 $ 1,226.5 $ (26.3 ) (2 )% Import 1,610.3 1,557.8 52.5 3 % Domestic 652.2 698.4 (46.2 ) (7 )% Total new vehicle revenue $ 3,462.7 $ 3,482.7 $ (20.0 ) (1 )% Gross profit: Luxury $ 79.0 $ 82.4 $ (3.4 ) (4 )% Import 56.3 67.0 (10.7 ) (16 )% Domestic 28.7 31.9 (3.2 ) (10 )% Total new vehicle gross profit $ 164.0 $ 181.3 $ (17.3 ) (10 )% New vehicle units: Luxury 22,525 23,424 (899 ) (4 )% Import 57,813 56,430 1,383 2 % Domestic 16,731 18,716 (1,985 ) (11 )% Total new vehicle units 97,069 98,570 (1,501 ) (2 )% 44 Table of Contents New Vehicle Metrics For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2017 2016 As Reported: Revenue per new vehicle sold $ 35,620 $ 35,286 $ 334 1 % Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 1,690 $ 1,828 $ (138 ) (8 )% New vehicle gross margin 4.7 % 5.2 % (0.5 )% Luxury: Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 3,503 $ 3,535 $ (32 ) (1 )% New vehicle gross margin 6.6 % 6.7 % (0.1 )% Import: Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 968 $ 1,178 $ (210 ) (18 )% New vehicle gross margin 3.5 % 4.3 % (0.8 )% Domestic: Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 1,775 $ 1,688 $ 87 5 % New vehicle gross margin 4.6 % 4.6 % % Same Store: Revenue per new vehicle sold $ 35,673 $ 35,332 $ 341 1 % Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 1,690 $ 1,839 $ (149 ) (8 )% New vehicle gross margin 4.7 % 5.2 % (0.5 )% Luxury: Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 3,507 $ 3,518 $ (11 ) % New vehicle gross margin 6.6 % 6.7 % (0.1 )% Import: Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 974 $ 1,187 $ (213 ) (18 )% New vehicle gross margin 3.5 % 4.3 % (0.8 )% Domestic: Gross profit per new vehicle sold $ 1,715 $ 1,704 $ 11 1 % New vehicle gross margin 4.4 % 4.6 % (0.2 )% New vehicle revenue decreased by $50.8 million ( 1% ), primarily as a result of a 2% decrease in new vehicle units sold, partially offset by a 1% increase in revenue per new vehicle sold. Same store new vehicle revenue decreased by $20.0 million ( 1% ) as a result of a 2% decrease in new vehicle units sold partially offset by a 1% increase in revenue per new vehicle sold. Same store unit volume decreased by 2% due to a 4% decrease in luxury units, and an 11% decrease in domestic units, partially offset by a 2% increase in import units. The 2% decrease in unit sales was in line with the overall decrease in 2017 U.S. new vehicle sales, which decrease 2% from 17.6 million in 2016 to 17.2 million in 2017 Same store new vehicle gross profit in 2017 decreased by $17.3 million ( 10% ), as a result of the 2% decrease in unit volumes and an 8% decrease in gross profit per new vehicle sold. The 50 basis point decrease in same store new vehicle gross margin from 5.2% in 2016 to 4.7% in 2017 , was primarily attributable to a higher mix of revenue and unit sales in our import brands, which have traditionally had lower margin than our luxury and domestic brands and experienced margin pressure during 2017 . 45 Table of Contents Used Vehicle For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2017 2016 (Dollars in millions, except for per vehicle data) As Reported: Revenue: Used vehicle retail revenues $ 1,635.3 $ 1,675.0 $ (39.7 ) (2 )% Used vehicle wholesale revenues 198.8 201.4 (2.6 ) (1 )% Used vehicle revenue $ 1,834.1 $ 1,876.4 $ (42.3 ) (2 )% Gross profit: Used vehicle retail gross profit $ 121.1 $ 131.0 $ (9.9 ) (8 )% Used vehicle wholesale gross profit 0.8 (3.7 ) 4.5 (122 )% Used vehicle gross profit $ 121.9 $ 127.3 $ (5.4 ) (4 )% Used vehicle retail units: Used vehicle retail units 76,929 79,259 (2,330 ) (3 )% Same Store: Revenue: Used vehicle retail revenues $ 1,577.3 $ 1,571.4 $ 5.9 % Used vehicle wholesale revenues 190.5 192.3 (1.8 ) (1 )% Used vehicle revenue $ 1,767.8 $ 1,763.7 $ 4.1 % Gross profit: Used vehicle retail gross profit $ 115.4 $ 123.0 $ (7.6 ) (6 )% Used vehicle wholesale gross profit 1.1 (2.9 ) 4.0 (138 )% Used vehicle gross profit $ 116.5 $ 120.1 $ (3.6 ) (3 )% Used vehicle retail units: Used vehicle retail units 73,772 73,490 282 % Used Vehicle Metrics For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2017 2016 As Reported: Revenue per used vehicle retailed $ 21,257 $ 21,133 $ 124 1 % Gross profit per used vehicle retailed $ 1,574 $ 1,653 $ (79 ) (5 )% Used vehicle retail gross margin 7.4 % 7.8 % (0.4 )% Same Store: Revenue per used vehicle retailed $ 21,381 $ 21,383 $ (2 ) % Gross profit per used vehicle retailed $ 1,564 $ 1,674 $ (110 ) (7 )% Used vehicle retail gross margin 7.3 % 7.8 % (0.5 )% Used vehicle revenue decreased by $42.3 million ( 2% ), as a result of a 3% decrease in used vehicle retail units sold, partially offset by a 1% increase in revenue per used vehicle retailed. In 2017 , same store used vehicle retail gross profit decreased by $7.6 million ( 6% ), resulting in a slight decrease in gross margin from 7.8% in 2016 to 7.3% in 2017 . We primarily attribute the 50 basis point decrease in same store used vehicle retail gross margin to increased competition and price transparency within the used vehicle marketplace. 46 Table of Contents Parts and Service For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2017 2016 (Dollars in millions) As Reported: Parts and service revenue $ 786.1 $ 778.5 $ 7.6 1 % Parts and service gross profit: Customer pay $ 272.3 $ 268.2 $ 4.1 2 % Warranty 81.7 73.7 8.0 11 % Wholesale parts 21.2 20.7 0.5 2 % Parts and service gross profit, excluding reconditioning and preparation $ 375.2 $ 362.6 $ 12.6 3 % Parts and service gross margin, excluding reconditioning and preparation 47.7 % 46.6 % 1.1 % Reconditioning and preparation 114.6 120.7 (6.1 ) (5 )% Total parts and service gross profit $ 489.8 $ 483.3 $ 6.5 1 % Total parts and service gross margin 62.3 % 62.1 % 0.2 % Same Store: Parts and service revenue $ 772.7 $ 743.8 $ 28.9 4 % Parts and service gross profit: Customer pay $ 267.2 $ 257.3 $ 9.9 4 % Warranty 80.5 71.4 9.1 13 % Wholesale parts 21.0 19.4 1.6 8 % Parts and service gross profit, excluding reconditioning and preparation $ 368.7 $ 348.1 $ 20.6 6 % Parts and service gross margin, excluding reconditioning and preparation 47.7 % 46.8 % 0.9 % Reconditioning and preparation 112.0 114.7 (2.7 ) (2 )% Total parts and service gross profit $ 480.7 $ 462.8 $ 17.9 4 % Total parts and service gross margin 62.2 % 62.2 % % The $7.6 million ( 1% ) increase in parts and service revenue is primarily due to $13.2 million (9%) increase in warranty revenue, partially offset by a $5.6 million (1%) decrease in customer pay revenue. Same store parts and service revenue increased $28.9 million ( 4% ) from $743.8 million in 2016 to $772.7 million in 2017 . The increase in same store parts and service revenue was primarily due to a $15.4 million (11%) increases in warranty revenue, $6.9 million (1%) increase in customer pay revenue , and a $6.6 million (6%) increase in wholesale parts revenue. Parts and service gross profit, excluding reconditioning and preparation, increased by $12.6 million ( 3% ) to $375.2 million and same store gross profit, excluding reconditioning and preparation, increased by $20.6 million ( 6% ) to $368.7 million . The increase in same store gross profit is primarily due to an increase in customer pay gross profit, which has continued to benefit from our strategic focus to improve customer retention and the recent trend of increasing new vehicle sales over the past few years. 47 Table of Contents Finance and Insurance, net For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2017 2016 (Dollars in millions, except for per vehicle data) As Reported: Finance and insurance, net $ 275.2 $ 261.0 $ 14.2 5 % Finance and insurance, net per vehicle sold $ 1,556 $ 1,437 $ 119 8 % Same Store: Finance and insurance, net $ 266.9 $ 249.1 $ 17.8 7 % Finance and insurance, net per vehicle sold $ 1,562 $ 1,448 $ 114 8 % F&I revenue increased by $14.2 million ( 5% ) during 2017 when compared to 2016 primarily as a result of a $119 ( 8% ) increase in F&I per vehicle retailed partially offset by a 3% decrease in used and new retail units. On a same store basis F&I revenue increased by $17.8 million ( 7% ) in 2017 when compared to 2016 primarily as a result of a $114 ( 8% ) increase in F&I per vehicle retailed partially offset by a 1% decrease in new and used retail unit sales.

The decrease in SG&A expense is primarily attributable to decreases in advertising, rent and insurance, partially offset by increases in higher personnel costs and outside services. Same store SG&A expense as a percentage of gross profit increased by 20 basis points, from 68.8% in 2016 to 69.0% in 2017 . The increase in SG&A expense is primarily attributable to higher personnel costs and higher outside services predominately related to our investments in technologies to improve our customer experience and productivity, partially offset by decreases in insurance, advertising, and rent expense. Depreciation and Amortization Expense The $1.4 million ( 5% ) increase in depreciation and amortization expense during 2017 compared to 2016 , was primarily the result of higher depreciable basis of assets placed in service during 2016 . Franchise rights impairment We assessed our manufacturer franchise rights for impairment by comparing the present value of cash flows attributable to each franchise right to its carrying value. As a result of our impairment testing, we recognized a $5.1 million pretax non-cash charge. 49 Table of Contents Other Operating Expense (income), net Other operating expense (income) net, includes gains and losses from the sale of property and equipment, income derived from lease arrangements, and other non-core operating items. The $1.3 million in other operating expense (income), net for 2017 , is primarily due to recognized expenses associated with lease terminations of $3.1 million, partially offset by $0.9 million of other income, and a $0.9 million gain recognized for legal settlements. Floor Plan Interest Expense The $3.4 million ( 18% ) increase in floor plan interest expense during 2017 compared to 2016 , was primarily the result of higher interest rates throughout 2017 compared to 2016 . Income Tax Expense The $30.6 million ( 30% ) decrease in income tax expense, is primarily due to the $58.7 million ( 22% ) decrease in income before income taxes in 2017 compared to 2016 coupled with a decrease in our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate was 33.5% in 2017 compared to 37.6% in 2016 . On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Act. The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that affect 2017, including, but not limited to, accelerated depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property. The Tax Act also establishes new tax laws that will affect 2018 and after, including a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate, we revalued our net deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and recorded a $7.9 million reduction based on our provisional estimate, with the offset recorded as a reduction to income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our effective tax rate decreased primarily as a result of the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability balance. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of December 31, 2018 , we had total available liquidity of $356.1 million , which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $8.3 million , $32.2 million of available funds in our floor plan offset accounts, $190.0 million of availability under our new vehicle floor plan facility that is able to be re-designated to our revolving credit facility, $47.0 million of availability under our revolving credit facility, and $78.6 million of availability under our used vehicle revolving floor plan facility. The borrowing capacities under our revolving credit facility and our used vehicle revolving floor plan facility are limited by borrowing base calculations and, from time to time, may be further limited by our required compliance with certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2018 , these financial covenants did not further limit our availability under our other credit facilities. For more information on our financial covenants, see "Covenants and Defaults" below. We continually evaluate our liquidity and capital resources based upon (i) our cash and cash equivalents on hand, (ii) the funds that we expect to generate through future operations, (iii) current and expected borrowing availability under our 2016 Senior Credit Facility, our other floor plan facilities, our Prior Real Estate Credit Agreement, our Restated Master Loan Agreement, and our mortgage financings (each, as defined below), (iv) amounts in our new vehicle floor plan notes payable offset accounts, and (v) the potential impact of our capital allocation strategy and any contemplated or pending future transactions, including but not limited to, financings, acquisitions, dispositions, equity and/or debt repurchases, dividends, or other capital expenditures. We believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our debt service and working capital requirements; commitments and contingencies; debt repayment, maturity and repurchase obligations; acquisitions; capital expenditures; and any operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. We currently are party to the following material credit facilities and agreements, and have the following material indebtedness outstanding. For a more detailed description of the material terms of these agreements and facilities, and this indebtedness, refer to the "Long-Term Debt" footnote included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2016 Senior Credit Facility On July 25, 2016, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit agreement with Bank of America, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto. The 2016 Senior Credit Facility amended and restated the Company's pre-existing senior secured credit agreement, dated as of August 8, 2013, by and among the Company and certain of its subsidiaries and Bank of America, as administrative agent, and the other agents and lenders party thereto (the "Restated Credit Agreement"). 50 Table of Contents The 2016 Senior Credit Facility provides for the following: Revolving Credit Facility A $250.0 million revolving credit facility for, among other things, acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures, including a $50.0 million sub-limit for letters of credit. As of December 31, 2018 , we re-designated $190.0 million of availability from our revolving credit facility to our new vehicle floor plan facility, resulting in $60.0 million of borrowing capacity. In addition, we had $13.0 million in outstanding letters of credit, resulting in $47.0 million of borrowing availability as of December 31, 2018 . New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility A $900.0 million new vehicle revolving floor plan facility. In connection, with the new vehicle floor plan facility, we established an account with Bank of America that allows us to transfer cash as an offset to floor plan notes payable. These transfers reduce the amount of outstanding new vehicle floor plan notes payable that would otherwise accrue interest, while retaining the ability to transfer amounts from the offset account into our operating cash accounts within one to two days. As a result of the use of our floor plan offset account, we experience a reduction in Floor Plan Interest Expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2018 , we had $822.1 million outstanding under our new vehicle floor plan facility, which is net of $20.9 million in our floor plan offset account. Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility A $150.0 million used vehicle revolving floor plan facility to finance the acquisition of used vehicle inventory and for, among other things, working capital and capital expenditures, as well as to refinance used vehicles. Our borrowing capacity under the used vehicle floor plan facility was limited to $78.6 million , based on our borrowing base calculation as of December 31, 2018 . We began the year with nothing drawn on our used vehicle floor plan facility and during the year ended December 31, 2018 , we had borrowings of $300.0 million and made repayments of $270.0 million, resulting in $30.0 million outstanding under our used vehicle floor plan facility as of December 31, 2018 . Subject to compliance with certain conditions, the agreement governing the 2016 Senior Credit Facility provides that we have the ability, at our option and subject to the receipt of additional commitments from existing or new lenders, to increase the size of the facilities by up to $325.0 million in the aggregate without lender consent. At our option, we have the ability to re-designate a portion of our availability under our Revolving Credit Facility to the New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility or the Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility. The maximum amount we are allowed to re-designate is determined based on our current borrowing availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, less $50.0 million. In addition, we are able to re-designate any amounts moved to the New Vehicle Floor plan facility or Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility back to the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018 , we re-designated $190.0 million of availability under our Revolving Credit Facility to our New Vehicle Floor Plan facility. We re-designated this amount to take advantage of the lower commitment fee rates on our New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility when compared to our Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or the Base Rate, in each case plus an Applicable Margin (as defined in the 2016 Senior Credit Facility). The Base Rate is the highest of the (i) Bank of America prime rate, (ii) Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, and (iii) one month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The Applicable Margin, for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, ranges from 1.25% to 2.50% for LIBOR loans and 0.25% to 1.50% for Base Rate loans, in each case based on the Company's total lease adjusted leverage ratio. Borrowings under the New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility bear interest, at the option of the Company, based on LIBOR plus 1.25% or the Base Rate plus 0.25%. Borrowings under the Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility bear interest, at the option of the Company, based on LIBOR plus 1.50% or the Base Rate plus 0.50%. In addition to the payment of interest on borrowings outstanding under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the total commitments thereunder. The fee for commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility is between 0.20% and 0.45% per year, based on the Company's total lease adjusted leverage ratio, and the fee for commitments under the New Vehicle Facility Floor Plan and the Used Vehicle Facility Floor Plan Facility is 0.15% per year. Manufacturer affiliated new vehicle floor plan facilities and other financing facilities We have a floor plan facility with the Ford Motor Credit Company ("Ford Credit") to purchase new Ford and Lincoln vehicle inventory, which matures on December 5, 2019. We also have a floor plan offset account with Ford Credit, which operates in a similar manner to our floor plan offset account with Bank of America. As of December 31, 2018 , we had $114.0 51 Table of Contents million , outstanding under our floor plan facility which is net of $11.3 million in our floor plan offset account. Additionally, we had $87.5 million outstanding under facilities with certain manufacturers for the financing of loaner vehicles, which were presented within Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Neither our floor plan facility with Ford Credit nor our facilities for loaner vehicles have stated borrowing limitations. 6.0% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024 ("6.0% Notes") as of December 31, 2018 we had $600.0 million in aggregate principal amounts outstanding related to our 6.0% Notes. We are required to pay interest on the 6.0% Notes on June 15 and December 15 of each year until maturity on December 15, 2024. Mortgage notes as of December 31, 2018 , we had $132.2 million of mortgage note obligations. These obligations are collateralized by the associated real estate at our dealership locations. Restated Master Loan Agreement provides for term loans to certain of our subsidiaries in an aggregate amount not to exceed $100.0 million. Borrowings under the Restated Master Loan Agreement are guaranteed by us and are collateralized by the real property financed under the Restated Master Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2018 , the outstanding balance under the Restated Master Loan Agreement was $83.3 million . There is no further borrowing availability under this facility. Prior Real Estate Credit Agreement a real estate term loan credit agreement (the "Prior Real Estate Credit Agreement"), with an initial principal value of $75.0 million collateralized by first priority liens, subject to certain permitted exceptions, on all of the real property financed thereunder. As of December 31, 2018 , we had $40.8 million of mortgage note obligations outstanding under the Prior Real Estate Credit Agreement. There is no further borrowing availability under the Prior Real Estate Credit Agreement. 2018 Bank of America Facility - On November 13, 2018, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a real estate term loan credit agreement (the Bank of America Credit Agreement") with Bank of America N.A. which provides for term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $128.1 million (the "Bank of America Facility"). The borrowers under the Bank of America Credit Agreement may borrow thereunder from time to time during the period beginning on November 13, 2018 until and including November 12, 2019. On November 13, 2018, certain of the borrowers borrowed an aggregate amount of $25.7 million under the Bank of America Credit Agreement, a portion of which was used to refinance certain of the Company other outstanding mortgage indebtedness. All of the real property financed by an operating dealership subsidiary of the Company under the Bank of America Facility is collateralized by first priority liens, subject to certain permitted exceptions. As of December 31, 2018 , we had $25.7 million of outstanding borrowings under the Bank of America Facility. 2018 Wells Fargo Master Loan Facility - On November 16, 2018, certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into a master loan agreement (the Wells Fargo Master Loan Agreement ) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as lender which provides for term loans to certain of the Company subsidiaries that are borrowers under the Wells Fargo Master Loan Agreement in an aggregate amount not to exceed $100.0 million (the "Wells Fargo Master Loan Facility"). The borrowers under the Wells Fargo Master Loan Agreement may borrow thereunder from time to time during the period beginning on November 16, 2018 until and including December 31, 2019 (the "Wells Fargo Draw Termination Date"). On November 16, 2018, certain of the borrowers borrowed an aggregate amount of $25.0 million under the Wells Fargo Master Loan Facility, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the Wells Fargo Master Loan Facility are guaranteed by the Company pursuant to a unconditional guaranty (the "Company Guaranty"), and all of the real property financed by any operating dealership subsidiary of the Company under the Wells Fargo Master Loan Facility is collateralized by first priority liens, subject to certain permitted exceptions. As of December 31, 2018 , we had $25.0 million outstanding borrowings under the Wells Fargo Master Loan Facility. Covenants and Defaults We are subject to a number of customary covenants in our various debt and lease agreements, including those described below. We were in compliance with all of our covenants as of December 31, 2018 . Failure to comply with any of our debt covenants would constitute a default under the relevant debt agreements, which would entitle the lenders under such agreements to terminate our ability to borrow under the relevant agreements and accelerate our obligations to repay outstanding borrowings, if any, unless compliance with the covenants were waived. In many cases, defaults under one of our agreements could trigger cross-default provisions in our other agreements. If we are unable to remain in compliance with our financial or other covenants, we would be required to seek waivers or modifications of our covenants from our lenders, or we would need to raise debt and/or equity financing or sell assets to generate proceeds sufficient to repay such debt. We cannot give any assurance that we would be able to successfully take any of these actions on terms, or at times, that may be necessary or desirable. 52 Table of Contents The representations and covenants contained in the 2016 Senior Credit Facility include, among others, a requirement to comply with a minimum consolidated current ratio, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated total lease adjusted leverage ratio, in each case as set out in the 2016 Senior Credit Facility. In addition, certain other covenants could restrict our ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends or acquire or dispose of assets. The 2016 Senior Credit Facility also provides for events of default that are customary for financing transactions of this nature, including cross-defaults to other material indebtedness. In certain instances, an event of default under either the revolving credit facility or the used vehicle floor plan facility could be, or result in, an event of default under the new vehicle floor plan facility, and vice versa. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, we could be required to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility. The representations and covenants contained in the Prior Real Estate Credit Agreement are customary for financing transactions of this nature including, among others, a requirement to comply with a minimum consolidated current ratio, minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and a maximum consolidated total lease adjusted leverage ratio, in each case as set out in the Prior Real Estate Credit Agreement. In addition, certain other covenants could restrict our ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends or acquire or dispose of assets. The representations and covenants contained in the Bank of America Credit Agreement are customary for financing transactions of this nature, including, among others, a requirement to comply with a minimum consolidated current ratio, minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum consolidated total lease adjusted leverage ratio, in each case as set out in the Bank of America Credit Agreement. In addition, certain other covenants could restrict the Company ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends or acquire or dispose of assets. The Bank of America Credit Agreement also provides for events of default that are customary for financing transactions of this nature, including cross-defaults to other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Company could be required by the Bank of America Facility to immediately repay all amounts outstanding thereunder. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Wells Fargo Master Loan Agreement, the Company Guaranty and the related documents are customary for financing transactions of this nature, including, among others, a requirement to comply with a minimum consolidated current ratio, minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum consolidated total lease adjusted leverage ratio, in each case as set out in the Company Guaranty. In addition, certain other covenants could restrict the Company ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends or acquire or dispose of assets. The representations, warranties, and covenants contained in the Restated Master Loan Agreement and the related documents include, among others, a requirement to comply with a minimum consolidated current ratio, minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum consolidated total lease adjusted leverage ratio, in each case as set out in the Restated Master Loan Agreement. In addition, certain other covenants could restrict our ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends, or acquire or dispose of assets. The Restated Master Loan Agreement also provides for events of default that are customary for financing transactions of this nature, including cross-defaults to other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Real Estate Borrowers or, failing such compliance, we could be required to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under the Restated Master Loan Agreement. Certain of our lease agreements also require compliance with various financial covenants and incorporate by reference the financial covenants set forth in the 2016 Senior Credit Facility. A breach of any of these covenants could immediately give rise to certain landlord remedies under our various lease agreements, the most severe of which include the following: (i) termination of the applicable lease and/or other leases with the same or an affiliated landlord under a cross-default provision, (ii) eviction from the premises, and (iii) the landlord having a claim for various damages. The 2016 Senior Credit Facility and the Indenture currently allow for restricted payments without limit so long as our Consolidated Total Leverage ratio (as defined in the 2016 Senior Credit Facility and the Indenture) is no greater than 3.0 to 1.0 after giving effect to such proposed restricted payments. Restricted payments generally include items such as dividends, share repurchases, unscheduled repayments of subordinated debt, or purchases of certain investments. In the event that our Consolidated Total Leverage ratio does (or would) exceed 3.0 to 1.0, the 2016 Senior Credit Facility and the Indenture would then also allow for restricted payments under the following mutually exclusive parameters, subject to certain exclusions: Restricted payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $20.0 million in any fiscal year; General restricted payments allowance of $150.0 million; and Subject to our continued compliance with a minimum consolidated current ratio, a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated total lease adjusted leverage ratio, in each case as set out in the Indenture, restricted payments capacity additions (or subtractions if negative) equal to (i) 50% of our net income (as defined in the 2016 Senior Credit Facility and the Indenture) beginning on October 1, 2014 and ending on the date of the most recently 53 Table of Contents completed fiscal quarter (the "Measurement Period"), plus (ii) 100% of any cash proceeds we receive from the sale of equity interests during the Measurement Period minus (iii) the dollar amount of share purchases made and dividends paid on or after December 4, 2014. Share Repurchases and Dividend Restrictions Our ability to repurchase shares or pay dividends on our common stock is subject to our compliance with the covenants and restrictions described in "Covenants and Defaults" above. On January 30, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the Repurchase Program. We began 2018 with $53.3 million in remaining share repurchase authorization. On both January 24, 2018 and October 19, 2018, our Board of Directors reset the authorization under our Repurchase Program to $100.0 million in the aggregate, for the repurchase of our common stock in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions, from time to time. During 2018 , we repurchased 1,580,910 shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program for a total of $105.4 million . As of December 31, 2018 we had remaining authorization to repurchase $81.5 million in shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program. During 2018 , we repurchased 71,434 shares of our common stock for $4.8 million from employees in connection with a net share settlement feature of employee equity-based awards. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2018 , we had the following contractual obligations (in millions; note references are to the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein): Payments due by period 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Total Floor plan notes payable (Notes10&11) $ 966.1 $ $ $ $ $ $ 966.1 Operating leases (Note 18) 22.5 22.2 19.2 14.0 6.0 25.5 109.4 Long-term debt (Note 13) 40.8 33.9 17.2 32.0 53.9 732.3 910.1 Interest on long-term debt (a) 50.2 48.5 47.6 45.5 43.5 42.0 277.3 Total contractual obligations $ 1,079.6 $ 104.6 $ 84.0 $ 91.5 $ 103.4 $ 799.8 $ 2,262.9 ________________________________________ (a) Includes variable rate interest payments calculated using an estimated LIBOR rate of 2.52%, and assumes that borrowings will not be refinanced prior to or upon maturity. Cash Flows Classification of Cash Flows Associated with Floor Plan Notes Payable Borrowings and repayments of floor plan notes payable to a lender unaffiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchase a particular new vehicle ("Non-Trade"), and all floor plan notes payable relating to used vehicles (together referred to as "Floor Plan Notes Payable Non-Trade"), are classified as financing activities on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, with borrowings reflected separately from repayments. The net change in floor plan notes payable to a lender affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchase a particular new vehicle (collectively referred to as "Floor Plan Notes Payable Trade") is classified as an operating activity on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Borrowings of floor plan notes payable associated with inventory acquired in connection with all acquisitions and repayments made in connection with all divestitures are classified as a financing activity in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in operating activities differ from cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in financing activities only to the extent that the former are payable to a lender affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchased the related inventory, while the latter are payable to a lender not affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchased the related inventory. The majority of our floor plan notes are payable to parties unaffiliated with the entities from which we purchase our new vehicle inventory, with the exception of floor plan notes payable relating to the financing of new Ford and Lincoln vehicles. Floor plan borrowings are required by all vehicle manufacturers for the purchase of new vehicles, and all floor plan lenders require amounts borrowed for the purchase of a vehicle to be repaid within a short time period after the related vehicle is sold. As a result, we believe that it is important to understand the relationship between the cash flows of all of our floor plan notes payable and new vehicle inventory in order to understand our working capital and operating cash flow and to be able to compare our operating cash flow to that of our competitors (i.e., if our competitors have a different mix of trade and non-trade floor plan financing as compared to us). In addition, we include all floor plan borrowings and repayments in our internal 54 Table of Contents operating cash flow forecasts. As a result, we use the non-GAAP measure "cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted" (defined below) to compare our results to forecasts. We believe that splitting the cash flows of floor plan notes payable between operating activities and financing activities, while all new vehicle inventory activity is included in operating activities, results in significantly different operating cash flow than if all the cash flows of floor plan notes payable were classified together in operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted, includes borrowings and repayments of floor plan notes payable to lenders not affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchase the related new vehicles and all floor plan notes payable relating to used vehicles. Cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted, has material limitations, and therefore, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results in accordance with GAAP. In order to compensate for these potential limitations we also review the related GAAP measures. We have provided below a reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities, as if all changes in floor plan notes payable, except for (i) borrowings associated with acquisitions and repayments associated with divestitures and (ii) borrowings and repayments associated with the purchase of used vehicle inventory, were classified as an operating activity. For the Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Reconciliation of Cash provided by operating activities to Cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted Cash provided by operating activities, as reported $ 10.1 $ 266.3 $ 142.5 New vehicle floor plan borrowings (repayments) non-trade, net 171.5 (70.7 ) 118.0 Cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted $ 181.6 $ 195.6 $ 260.5 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $10.1 million , $266.3 million , and $142.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted, totaled $181.6 million , $195.6 million , and $260.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted, includes net income, adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities, changes in working capital, and changes in floor plan notes payable non-trade. The $14.0 million decrease in our net cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 , was primarily the result of the following: $19.8 million related to the change in inventory, net of floor plan notes payable, including both trade and non-trade; $13.6 million related to the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities; $6.0 million related timing and collection of accounts receivable and contracts-in-transit during 2018 as compared to 2017; and $2.0 million related to the change in other current and non-current assets and liabilities. The decrease in our net cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted, was partially offset by: $27.4 million related to non-cash adjustments to net income. The $64.9 million decrease in our net cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily the result of the following: $29.4 million related to an increase in inventory, net of floor plan notes payable, including both trade and non-trade; $47.1 million related to the change in other current and non-current assets and liabilities; and $34.0 million related to the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The decrease in our net cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted, was partially offset by: 55 Table of Contents $25.9 million related to sales volume and the timing of collection of accounts receivable and contracts-in-transit during 2017 as compared to 2016; and $19.7 million related to non-cash adjustments to net income. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $149.6 million and $127.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 . Cash flows from investing activities relate primarily to capital expenditures, acquisitions, divestitures, and the sale of property and equipment. Capital expenditures, excluding the purchase of real estate and acquisitions, were $40.3 million , $42.3 million , and $81.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. Purchases of real estate totaled $17.6 million , $5.8 million , and $10.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. In addition, we purchased previously leased facilities for $4.4 million , $5.4 million , and 19.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. We expect that capital expenditures during 2019 will total approximately $55.0 million to upgrade or replace our existing facilities, construct new facilities, expand our service capacity, and invest in technology and equipment. In addition, as part of our capital allocation strategy, we continually evaluate opportunities to purchase properties currently under lease and acquire properties in connection with future dealership relocations. No assurances can be provided that we will have or be able to access capital at times or on terms in amounts deemed necessary to execute this strategy. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 we acquired three franchises (three dealership locations) for an aggregate purchase price of $91.3 million and two franchises (two dealership locations) and one collision center for an aggregate purchase price of 80.1 million , respectively. We did not acquire any franchises during the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no divestitures during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 . During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we divested five franchises (four dealership locations) and two collision centers for proceeds of $114.3 million . Additionally, proceeds from the sale of assets, unrelated to the dealership divestitures, were $4.0 million , $5.8 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $143.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 . Net cash used in financing activities totaled $137.2 million and $146.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , we had non-trade floor plan borrowings of $4.59 billion , $3.85 billion , and $3.87 billion , respectively. Included in our non-trade floor plan borrowings, were borrowings of $300.0 million, $35.0 million, and $55.0 million, for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively, related to our used vehicle floor plan facility. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2018 , and 2017 , we had non-trade floor plan borrowings of $22.7 million , and 25.1 million , respectively, related to acquisitions. There were no borrowings related to acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2016. The majority of our floor plan notes are payable to parties unaffiliated with the entities from which we purchase our new vehicle inventory, with the exception of floor plan notes payable relating to the financing of new Ford and Lincoln vehicles. During the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , we made non-trade floor plan repayments of $4.39 billion , $3.92 billion , and $3.75 billion , respectively. Included in our non-trade floor plan repayments were repayments of $270.0 million, $35.0 million, and $55.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively, related to our used vehicle floor plan facility.
