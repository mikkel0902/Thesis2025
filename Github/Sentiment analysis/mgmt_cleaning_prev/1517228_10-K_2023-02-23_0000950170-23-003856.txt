ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared with the year ended December 31, 2021. This comparison should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under "Risk Factors" included in Part I, Item 1A or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, see Part II, Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 17, 2022. OVERVIEW We are a global provider of infrastructure solutions for communication, data center and entertainment networks. Our solutions for wired and wireless networks enable service providers, including cable, telephone and digital broadcast satellite operators and media programmers, to deliver media, voice, Internet Protocol (IP) data services and Wi-Fi to their subscribers and allow enterprises to experience constant wireless and wired connectivity across complex and varied networking environments. Our solutions are complemented by services including technical support, systems design and integration. We are a leader in digital video and IP Television distribution systems, broadband access infrastructure platforms and equipment that delivers data and voice networks to homes. Our global leadership position is built upon innovative technology, broad solution offerings, high-quality and cost-effective customer solutions, and global manufacturing and distribution scale. In 2021, we announced a transformation initiative referred to as CommScope NEXT designed to drive shareholder value through three pillars: profitable growth, operational efficiency and portfolio optimization. We believe these efforts are critical to making us more competitive and allowing us to invest in growth, de-leverage and maximize stockholder and other stakeholder value. We have incurred $62.9 million and $91.9 million of restructuring costs and $38.2 million and $90.3 million of transaction, transformation and integration costs during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily related to CommScope NEXT. We expect to continue to incur restructuring costs and transaction, transformation and integration costs related to CommScope NEXT in 2023 and such costs could be material. As a step to optimize our portfolio through CommScope NEXT, as of January 1, 2022, we reorganized our internal management and reporting structure to align our portfolio of products and solutions more closely with the markets we serve and provide better performance comparability with our competitive peer set across our businesses. The reorganization changed the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result, we are now reporting financial performance based on the following operating segments: Connectivity and Cable Solutions (CCS), Outdoor Wireless Networks (OWN), Networking, Intelligent Cellular and Security Solutions (NICS), Access Network Solutions (ANS) and Home Networks (Home). Prior to this change, we operated and reported four operating segments: Broadband Networks, Outdoor Wireless Networks, Venue and Campus Networks and Home Networks. The Home segment was unchanged in this realignment. All prior period amounts have been recast to reflect these operating segment changes. Also as a step in our CommScope NEXT transformation plan, in 2021, we announced a plan to separate the Home Networks business. Due to the impact of the uncertain supply chain environment, capital spending patterns of customers and other macroeconomic factors related to the Home Networks business, we have delayed our separation plan, but we continue to analyze the financial results of our "Core" business separately from Home. As such, below we refer to certain supplementary Core financial measures, which reflect the results of our CCS, OWN, NICS and ANS segments in the aggregate. See the Segment Results section below for the aggregation of our Core financial measures. 45 Impacts of Supply Chain Constraints and Inflation As in many industries, we have seen the negative impacts of COVID-19 recede and a recovery in demand for our products over the past year, but this has created negative indirect consequences such as inflation, shortages in materials and components and increased logistics costs. Prices for certain commodities and other raw materials that we use have experienced significant volatility as a result of changes in the levels of global demand, supply disruptions, including port, transportation and distribution delays or interruptions, and other factors. As a result, we have seen a significant increase in costs that has negatively impacted our results of operations. We are also experiencing limited supply of memory devices, capacitors and silicon chips, which has increased our costs and has impacted our ability to deliver products on a timely basis due to extended lead times. We have mitigated some of our increased component and logistics costs by implementing higher prices on our products and services. We are also mitigating certain shortages by purchasing components in advance and maintaining higher levels of inventory, finding alternate vendors for some components or in certain cases, product redesign. We believe the global supply chain challenges and their adverse impact on our business and financial results will continue to improve in 2023 but certain shortages could continue throughout 2023. We also believe certain macroeconomic pressures in the U.S. and the global economy, such as rising interest rates and energy prices as well as customer concern about an economic slow-down, could impact the timing and amount of capital spending by our customers in 2023, which could negatively impact our results of operations. For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States (U.S.). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and their underlying assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other objective sources. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates, as appropriate, when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary. The following critical accounting policies and estimates reflected in our financial statements are based on management knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management assumptions about future events. While we have generally not experienced significant deviations from our critical estimates in the past, it is reasonably possible that these estimates may ultimately differ materially from actual results. See Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of all our significant accounting policies. Asset Impairment Reviews Impairment Reviews of Goodwill We test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually as of October 1 and on an interim basis when events occur or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value may no longer be recoverable. We compare the fair value of our reporting units with the carrying amount, including goodwill. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the reporting unit carrying amount exceeds its fair value. 46 We estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow (DCF) method or, as appropriate, a combination of the DCF method and a market approach known as the guideline public company method. Under the DCF method, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The significant assumptions in the DCF model primarily include, but are not limited to, forecasts of annual revenue growth rates, annual operating income margin, the terminal growth rate and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flow projections. When determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, we consider historical performance trends, industry data, insight derived from customers, relevant changes in the reporting unit underlying business and other market trends that may affect the reporting unit. The discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital as of the test date of market participants in the industry in which the reporting unit operates and is commensurate with the risk and uncertainty inherent in each reporting unit and in internally developed forecasts. Under the guideline public company method, we estimate the fair value based upon market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. The weighting of the fair value derived from the market approach may vary depending on the level of comparability of these publicly-traded companies to the reporting unit. When comparable public companies are not meaningful or not available, we may estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the DCF method. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves uncertainties because it requires management to develop numerous assumptions, including assumptions about the future growth and potential volatility in revenues and costs, capital expenditures, industry economic factors and future business strategy. Changes in projected revenue growth rates, projected operating income margins or estimated discount rates due to uncertain market conditions, loss of one or more key customers, changes in our strategy, changes in technology or other factors could negatively affect the fair value in one or more of our reporting units and result in a material impairment charge in the future. To assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair values of our reporting units, we also compare the sum of the reporting units fair values to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair values over the market capitalization). If the implied control premium is not reasonable, we will reevaluate the fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates and/or other assumptions. 2022 Interim and Annual Goodwill Analysis Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of the reporting unit may exceed its fair value. We assessed goodwill for impairment due to a change in the composition of certain reporting units resulting from the new segment structure as of January 1, 2022. We performed impairment testing immediately before and after the change and determined that no goodwill impairment existed. The annual test of goodwill impairment was performed for each of the reporting units with goodwill balances as of October 1, 2022. For the 2022 annual goodwill test, we determined the fair value of each reporting unit using a DCF model and a guideline public company approach, with 75% of the value determined using the DCF model and 25% of the value determined using the market approach. The range of discount rates used in our annual tests were 10.0% to 12.0% for 2022. During the annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2022 and in conjunction with the development of our 2023 and long-range plans, we identified changes in our ANS reporting unit's expected future cash flows due to various market trends expected to affect the business, including technology shifts affecting hardware sales, trends affecting bandwidth growth and other operational challenges, as well as an increase in the cost of capital. As a result, we determined the goodwill balance in the ANS reporting unit was partially impaired and recorded a $1,119.6 million impairment charge. The ANS reporting unit has remaining goodwill allocated of $734.0 million as of October 1, 2022. The ANS reporting unit is the same as our ANS reportable segment. As discussed, our ANS reporting unit failed the annual goodwill impairment test and a partial impairment was recorded as of October 1, 2022. Also, the amount by which our Building and Data Center Connectivity (BDCC) reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value was lower year over year. The BDCC reporting unit is in our CCS reportable segment. Considering the headroom going forward for each of the ANS and BDCC reporting units, there is a risk for future impairment in the event of declines in general economic, market or business conditions or any significant unfavorable change in the forecasted cash flows, weighted average cost of capital or growth rates. If current and long-term projections for our ANS and BDCC reporting units are not realized or decrease materially, we may be required to recognize additional goodwill impairment charges and these charges could be material to our results of operations. 47 The following table provides summary information regarding our reporting units with goodwill balances as of December 31, 2022 that have the lowest level of headroom. The table presents key assumptions used in our annual goodwill analysis, along with sensitivity analysis showing the effect of a change in certain key assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant, to the resulting fair value using an income approach. Key Assumptions Goodwill Excess (Deficit) of Fair Value to Carrying Value Reporting Unit Discount Rate Terminal Growth Rate Balance at December 31, 2022 % of Total Assets Result of Annual Goodwill Test as of October 1, 2022 Decrease of 10% in Cash Flows Decrease of 0.5% in Long-term Growth Rate Increase of 0.5% in Discount Rate ANS 10.0 % 1.0 % $ 734.0 6.3 % $ (1,119.6 ) $ (1,265.5 ) $ (1,165.8 ) $ (1,196.6 ) BDCC 11.5 % 1.5 % 975.9 8.4 % 290.4 161.5 258.5 231.3 Definite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets Management reviews definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable. This analysis differs from our goodwill impairment analysis in that an intangible or other long-lived asset impairment is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows related to the assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of the assets. If the forecasted net cash flows are less than the carrying value, then the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. We performed a recoverability test for our ANS reporting unit because of the goodwill impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our Home Networks reporting unit also had an indicator of impairment as its carrying amount exceeded its estimated fair value. We did not identify any impairments of definite-lived intangible assets as a result of these tests. Changes in the estimates of forecasted net cash flows or changes in classification from held for use may result in future asset impairments that could be material to our results of operations. We impaired certain other long-lived assets as a result of restructuring actions in 2022. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue based on the satisfaction of distinct obligations to transfer goods and services to customers. Our revenue is generated primarily from product or equipment sales. We also generate revenue from custom design and installation services as well as bundled sales arrangements that include product, software and services. We apply a five-step approach as defined in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when a corresponding performance obligation is satisfied. Most contracts with customers are to provide distinct products or services within a single contract. However, if a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling price. Product sales, to end-customers or distributors, represent over 90% of our revenue and are recognized at a point-in-time, which is generally at the point in time when products have been shipped, right to payment has been obtained and risk of loss has been transferred. Certain of our product performance obligations include proprietary operating system software, which typically is not considered separately identifiable. Therefore, sales of these products and the related software are considered one performance obligation. License contracts include revenue recognized for the licensing of intellectual property, including software, sold separately without products. Functional intellectual property licenses do not meet the criteria for revenue to be recognized over time and revenue is most commonly recognized upon delivery of the license/software to the customer. The Company has service arrangements where net sales are recognized over time. These arrangements include a variety of post-contract support service offerings, which are generally recognized over time as the services are provided, including the following: maintenance and support services provided under annual service-level agreements; Day 2 professional services to help customers maximize their utilization of deployed systems; and installation services related to the routine installation of equipment ordered by the customer at the customer site. 48 Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled based on customer contracts. Sales are adjusted for variable consideration amounts, including but not limited to estimated discounts, rebates, distributor price protection programs and returns. These estimates are determined based upon historical experience, contract terms, inventory levels in the distributor channel and other related factors. Adjustments to variable consideration estimates are recorded when circumstances indicate revisions may be necessary. Variable consideration is primarily related to sales to our distributors, system integrators and value-added resellers. A contract liability for deferred revenue is recorded when consideration is received or is unconditionally due from a customer prior to transferring control of goods or services to the customer under the terms of a contract. Deferred revenue balances typically result from advance payments received from customers for product contracts or from billings in excess of revenue recognized on project or services arrangements. Unbilled receivables are recorded when revenues are recognized in advance of invoice issuance. These assets are presented on a combined basis with accounts receivable and are converted to accounts receivable once our right to the consideration becomes unconditional, which varies by contract but is generally based on achieving certain acceptance milestones. We recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset would be one year or less. We include shipping and handling costs billed to customers in net sales and include the costs incurred to transport product to customers as well as certain internal handling costs, which relate to activities to prepare goods for shipment, as cost of sales. Shipping and handling costs incurred after control is transferred to the customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are not accounted for as separate revenue obligations. Contingencies and Litigation We are a party to lawsuits, claims and proceedings incident to the operation of our business, including intellectual property infringement matters, those pertaining to labor and employment contracts and other matters, some of which allege substantial monetary damages. We assess these matters in order to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, management may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. We expense legal fees associated with consultations and defense of lawsuits as incurred. We accrue for loss contingencies when losses become probable and are reasonably estimable. If the reasonable estimate of the loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate, the minimum amount of the range is recorded as a liability. Gain contingencies are recognized when they are realized. Litigation outcomes are difficult to predict and are often resolved over long periods of time, making our estimates highly judgmental. Estimating probable losses requires the analysis of multiple possible outcomes that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties, such as future changes in facts and circumstances, differing interpretations of the law, assessments of the amount of damages and other factors beyond our control. There is the potential for a material adverse effect on our results of operation and cash flows if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount materially in excess of what we anticipated. Alternatively, if the judgments and estimates made by management are incorrect and a particular contingent loss does not occur, the contingent loss recorded would be reversed, thereby favorably impacting our results of operations. Inventory Reserves We maintain reserves to reduce the value of inventory based on the lower of cost or net realizable value, including allowances for excess and obsolete inventory. These reserves are based on management assumptions about and analysis of relevant factors including current levels of orders and backlog, forecasted demand, market conditions and new products or innovations that diminish the value of existing inventories. If actual market conditions deteriorate from those anticipated by management, additional allowances for excess and obsolete inventory could be required and may be material to our results of operations. 49 Product Warranty Reserves We recognize a liability for the estimated claims that may be paid under our customer assurance-type warranty agreements to remedy potential deficiencies of quality or performance of our products. The product warranties extend over various periods, depending upon the product subject to the warranty and the terms of the individual agreements. We record a provision for estimated future warranty claims based upon the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales and specifically identified warranty issues. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revise our estimates, as appropriate, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary. Although these estimates are based on management knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management assumptions about future events, it is reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results, including in the case of a significant product failure, and may be material to our results of operations. Tax Valuation Allowances and Liabilities for Unrecognized Tax Benefits We establish an income tax valuation allowance when available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider the amounts, character, source and timing of expected future deductions or carryforwards as well as sources of taxable income and tax planning strategies that may enable utilization. We maintain an existing valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. Changes in the amount or timing of expected future deductions or taxable income may have a material impact on the level of income tax valuation allowances. If we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future, an increase to an income tax valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made. We recognize income tax benefits related to particular tax positions only when it is considered more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained if examined on its technical merits by tax authorities. The amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is evaluated to be greater than 50% likely to be realized. Considerable judgment is required to evaluate the technical merits of various positions and to evaluate the likely amount of benefit to be realized. Lapses in statutes of limitations, developments in tax laws, regulations and interpretations, and changes in assessments of the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions could have a material impact on the overall tax provision. We establish deferred tax liabilities for the estimated tax cost associated with foreign earnings that we do not consider permanently reinvested (primarily foreign withholding and state income taxes). These liabilities are subject to adjustment if there is a change in the assertion of whether the foreign earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. We also establish allowances related to value-added and similar recoverable taxes when it is considered probable that those assets are not recoverable. Changes in the probability of recovery or in the estimates of the amount recoverable are recognized in the period such determination is made and may be material to our net loss. 50 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 with the year ended December 31, 2021 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Amount % of Net Sales Amount % of Net Sales $ Change % Change (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Net sales $ 9,228.1 100.0 % $ 8,586.7 100.0 % $ 641.4 7.5 % Core net sales (1) 7,524.7 81.5 6,737.4 78.5 787.3 11.7 Gross profit 2,804.1 30.4 2,684.3 31.3 119.8 4.5 Operating income (loss) (713.8 ) (7.7 ) 48.6 0.6 (762.4 ) (1,568.7 ) Core operating income (loss) (1) (573.6 ) (7.6 ) 263.5 3.9 (837.1 ) (317.7 ) Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA (2) 1,276.7 13.8 1,117.0 13.0 159.7 14.3 Core adjusted EBITDA (1) 1,250.4 16.6 1,091.5 16.2 158.9 14.6 Net loss (1,286.9 ) (13.9 ) (462.6 ) (5.4 ) (824.3 ) 178.2 Diluted loss per share $ (6.49 ) $ (2.55 ) $ (3.94 ) 154.1 (1) Core financial measures reflect the results of our CCS, OWN, NICS and ANS segments, in the aggregate, and exclude the results of our Home segment. See the Segment Results section below for illustration of the aggregation of our Core financial measures. (2) See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures" in this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below. Net sales Year Ended December 31, $ % 2022 2021 Change Change (dollars in millions) Net sales $ 9,228.1 $ 8,586.7 $ 641.4 7.5 % Domestic 5,750.5 4,960.5 790.0 15.9 International 3,477.6 3,626.2 (148.6 ) (4.1 ) Net sales in 2022 increased $641.4 million, or 7.5%, compared to the prior year driven by higher pricing. Core net sales in 2022 increased $787.3 million, or 11.7%, compared to the prior year with increases in the CCS segment of $735.8 million, the NICS segment of $77.8 million and the OWN segment of $50.8 million, partially offset by a decrease of $77.1 million in the ANS segment. Net sales in 2022 in the Home segment decreased $145.9 million compared to the prior year. During 2022, we continued to experience supply shortages and extended lead times for certain materials that negatively affected our ability to meet customer demand for certain of our products. We expect these shortages and delays to improve for some components, but we expect to continue to experience shortages and delays for others into 2023. For further details by segment, see the discussion of Segment Results below. From a regional perspective in 2022, net sales increased in the U.S. by $790.0 million and Canada by $94.4 million, but these increases were partially offset by decreases in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region of $114.1 million, the Caribbean and Latin American (CALA) region of $103.3 million and the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region of $25.6 million. Net sales to customers located outside of the U.S. comprised 38% of total net sales for 2022 compared to 42% for 2021. Foreign exchange rate changes impacted net sales unfavorably by approximately 2% for 2022 compared to the prior year. For additional information on regional sales by segment, see discussion of Segment Results below and Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 51 Gross profit, SG&A expense and R&D expense Year Ended December 31, $ % 2022 2021 Change Change (dollars in millions) Gross profit $ 2,804.1 $ 2,684.3 $ 119.8 4.5 % As a percent of sales 30.4 % 31.3 % SG&A expense 1,135.0 1,233.9 (98.9 ) (8.0 ) As a percent of sales 12.3 % 14.4 % R&D expense 657.4 683.2 (25.8 ) (3.8 ) As a percent of sales 7.1 % 8.0 % Gross profit (net sales less cost of sales) Gross profit increased in 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher net sales, partially offset by higher material and freight costs and unfavorable product mix. Selling, general and administrative expense For 2022, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased by $98.9 million compared to 2021, primarily due to a decrease in transaction, transformation, and integration costs of $52.1 million and cost savings initiatives. We expect to continue to incur transaction, transformation and integration costs related to CommScope NEXT in 2023 and such costs could be material. Also included in 2022 SG&A expense is $20.9 million of bad debt expense related to deterioration in the credit profile of a certain distributor in the OWN segment; and similarly, in 2021, we recorded bad debt expense of $30.3 million related to the credit deterioration of a specific Home segment value added reseller. Research and development expense Research and development (R&D) expense for 2022 decreased primarily due to lower spending on ANS segment products of $27.3 million. Spending on OWN and Home segment products also declined but was offset by higher spending on CCS and NICS segment products. R&D activities generally relate to ensuring that our products are capable of meeting the evolving technological needs of our customers, bringing new products to market and modifying existing products to better serve our customers. Amortization of purchased intangible assets, Restructuring costs, net and Asset impairments Year Ended December 31, $ % 2022 2021 Change Change (dollars in millions) Amortization of purchased intangible assets $ 543.0 $ 613.0 $ (70.0 ) (11.4 )% Restructuring costs, net 62.9 91.9 (29.0 ) (31.6 ) Asset impairments 1,119.6 13.7 1,105.9 8,072.3 Amortization of purchased intangible assets The amortization of purchased intangible assets was lower in 2022 compared to the prior year because certain of our intangible assets became fully amortized. Restructuring costs, net The net restructuring costs recorded in 2022 included $59.3 million related to CommScope NEXT. From a cash perspective, we paid $49.4 million to settle CommScope NEXT restructuring liabilities during 2022 and expect to pay an additional $58.2 million in 2023 and $0.5 million in 2024 related to restructuring actions that have been initiated. The net restructuring costs recorded in 2021 included $90.7 million related to CommScope NEXT. Additional restructuring actions related to CommScope NEXT are expected to be identified and the resulting charges and cash requirements could be material. 52 Asset impairments We recorded goodwill impairment charges of $1,119.6 million in 2022 related to our ANS reporting unit which is the same as our ANS segment. See the discussion above under Critical Accounting Policies for more information regarding the annual goodwill impairment test performed during 2022. We recorded goodwill impairment charges of $13.7 million during 2021 related to our Home Networks reporting unit within our Home segment. Other expense, net Year Ended December 31, $ % 2022 2021 Change Change (dollars in millions) Foreign currency loss $ (4.1 ) $ (4.4 ) $ 0.3 (6.8 )% Other income (expense), net 4.0 (19.4 ) 23.4 NM NM - Not meaningful Foreign currency loss Foreign currency loss includes the net foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the settlement of receivables and payables, foreign currency contracts and short-term intercompany advances in a currency other than the subsidiary functional currency. The change in foreign currency loss in 2022 compared to 2021 was not significant. Other income (expense), net The change in other income (expense), net in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to a redemption fee paid in 2021 of $34.4 million related to the refinancing of our 5.50% senior secured notes due March 2024 (2024 Secured Notes). The remaining change is due to changes in income derived from equity method investments and other miscellaneous investments. Interest expense, Interest income and Income taxes Year Ended December 31, $ % 2022 2021 Change Change (dollars in millions) Interest expense $ (588.9 ) $ (561.2 ) $ (27.7 ) 4.9 % Interest income 2.8 1.9 0.9 47.4 Income tax benefit 13.1 71.9 (58.8 ) (81.8 ) Interest expense and Interest income Interest expense increased in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was driven by higher interest expense related to our senior secured term loan due 2026 (2026 Term Loan) due to the increased variable interest rate compared to 2021. This increase was partially offset by lower interest on our fixed rate debt due to the refinancing of our 2024 Secured Notes in 2021. We expect our interest expense will increase in 2023 as a result of the Federal Reserve's increase in interest rates in 2022 and the expectation that they will continue to raise interest rates into 2023. Our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings, including the impact of the interest rate swap and the amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount, was 6.91% at December 31, 2022 and 5.74% at December 31, 2021. Income tax benefit For 2022, we recognized an income tax benefit of $13.1 million on a pretax loss of $1,300.0 million. Our tax benefit was less than the statutory rate of 21.0% in 2022 primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge of $1,119.6 million, for which minimal tax benefits were recorded. Our tax benefit was also impacted by the unfavorable impacts of U.S. anti-deferral provisions and non-creditable withholding taxes, partially offset by tax benefit related to federal tax credits. See Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more discussion of our income tax benefit. For 2021, our effective tax rate was 13.5% and we recognized an income tax benefit of $71.9 million on a pretax loss of $534.5 million. Our tax benefit was less than the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of $37.4 million of tax expense related to a foreign tax rate change. 53 Segment Results Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Amount % of Net Sales Amount % of Net Sales $ Change % Change (dollars in millions) Net sales by segment: CCS $ 3,789.6 41.1 % $ 3,053.8 35.6 % $ 735.8 24.1 % OWN 1,467.9 15.9 1,417.1 16.5 50.8 3.6 NICS 939.7 10.2 861.9 10.0 77.8 9.0 ANS 1,327.5 14.4 1,404.6 16.4 (77.1 ) (5.5 ) Core net sales (1) 7,524.7 81.5 6,737.4 78.5 787.3 11.7 Home 1,703.4 18.5 1,849.3 21.5 (145.9 ) (7.9 ) Consolidated net sales $ 9,228.1 100.0 % $ 8,586.7 100.0 % $ 641.4 7.5 % Operating income (loss) by segment: CCS $ 438.2 11.6 % $ 138.5 4.5 % $ 299.7 216.4 % OWN 189.0 12.9 197.3 13.9 (8.3 ) (4.2 ) NICS (51.2 ) (5.4 ) (143.5 ) (16.6 ) 92.3 (64.3 ) ANS (1,149.6 ) (86.6 ) 71.2 5.1 (1,220.8 ) (1,714.6 ) Core operating income (loss) (1) (573.6 ) (7.6 ) 263.5 3.9 (837.1 ) (317.7 ) Home (140.2 ) (8.2 ) (214.9 ) (11.6 ) 74.7 (34.8 ) Consolidated operating income (loss) $ (713.8 ) (7.7 ) % $ 48.6 0.6 % $ (762.4 ) (1,568.7 ) % Adjusted EBITDA by segment: CCS $ 643.6 17.0 % $ 448.9 14.7 % $ 194.7 43.4 % OWN 269.7 18.4 266.8 18.8 2.9 1.1 NICS 51.9 5.5 (15.3 ) (1.8 ) 67.2 NM ANS 285.2 21.5 391.1 27.8 (105.9 ) (27.1 ) Core adjusted EBITDA (1) 1,250.4 16.6 1,091.5 16.2 158.9 14.6 Home 26.3 1.5 25.5 1.4 0.8 3.1 Non-GAAP consolidated adjusted EBITDA (2) $ 1,276.7 13.8 % $ 1,117.0 13.0 % $ 159.7 14.3 % NM - Not meaningful (1) Core financial measures reflect the results of our CCS, OWN, NICS and ANS segments, in the aggregate, and exclude the results of our Home segment. (2) See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures within this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Connectivity and Cable Solutions Segment Net sales for the CCS segment increased in 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased demand for our products and services as service providers continued to enhance their networks to keep pace with increasing broadband demand. We were able to meet this increased demand with the additional production enabled by our capacity expansion. CCS segment net sales also significantly benefitted from pricing increases. The supply shortages with certain of our network cable products experienced during the first half of the year eased in the second half and are expected to continue to improve into 2023. From a regional perspective in 2022, net sales increased in the U.S. by $690.0 million, the EMEA region by $23.9 million, Canada by $20.1 million and the CALA region by $10.2 million but decreased in the APAC region by $8.4 million compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange rate changes impacted CCS segment net sales unfavorably by approximately 2% during 2022. 54 For 2022, CCS segment operating income and adjusted EBITDA both benefitted from pricing increases, higher sales volumes and operational efficiencies compared to the prior year. These benefits were partially offset by higher material costs, unfavorable product mix, increases in SG&A costs, higher freight costs and increases in R&D costs. In 2022, CCS segment operating income was favorably impacted by reductions of $57.2 million in amortization expense, $44.9 million in restructuring expense and $7.9 million in transaction, transformation and integration costs but was unfavorably impacted by a $2.7 million net charge to establish an allowance against certain accounts receivable determined to be uncollectible as a result of the Russia/Ukraine conflict. Amortization expense, restructuring expense, transaction, transformation and integration costs and the charge related to certain uncollectible accounts receivable resulting from the Russia/Ukraine conflict are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA. See Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA within this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below. Outdoor Wireless Networks Segment For 2022, OWN segment net sales increased compared to the prior year primarily due to favorable pricing impacts. From a regional perspective in 2022, OWN segment net sales increased in the U.S. by $168.3 million but decreased in the EMEA region by $54.4 million, the APAC region by $29.9 million, Canada by $21.4 million and the CALA region by $11.8 million. Foreign exchange rate changes impacted OWN segment net sales unfavorably by approximately 2% during 2022. For 2022, OWN segment operating income decreased and adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year. Both operating income and adjusted EBITDA benefitted from favorable pricing impacts, favorable product mix and benefits from decreases in selling and marketing and R&D costs, but these were partially offset by higher material and freight costs and higher bad debt expense, driven by a $20.9 million reserve related to a distribution customer. In addition, OWN segment operating income for 2022 was unfavorably impacted by an increase of $18.8 million in restructuring expense which is not reflected in adjusted EBITDA. See Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA within this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below. Networking, Intelligent Cellular and Security Solutions Segment Net sales increased in 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to the impacts of favorable pricing and to a lesser extent increases in sales volumes particularly in the second half of the year. We experienced material shortages related to our Ruckus products during the first half of 2022 which negatively impacted our sales volumes for the year. We saw some improvement in material shortages in the second half of 2022, but we expect certain shortages to continue into 2023. From a regional perspective in 2022, net sales increased in the U.S. by $49.1 million, the EMEA region by $12.5 million, the APAC region by $11.6 million, Canada by $2.6 million and the CALA region by $2.0 million compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange rate changes impacted NICS segment net sales unfavorably by approximately 2% during 2022. For 2022, NICS segment operating loss decreased and adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year and both benefitted from favorable pricing impacts on certain products, higher sales volumes, lower SG&A costs and lower freight costs. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher material costs and higher R&D costs. For 2022, NICS segment operating loss was favorably impacted by reductions of $12.3 million in amortization expense which is not reflected in adjusted EBITDA. See Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA within this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below. Access Network Solutions Segment Net sales decreased in 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower volumes related to the negative impact of supply constraints and also due to projects in the first half of 2021 that did not recur in 2022. These unfavorable impacts to net sales were partially offset by pricing increases on ANS segment products. From a regional perspective in 2022, net sales decreased in the CALA region by $82.5 million, the APAC region by $52.2 million and the EMEA region by $22.5 million but increased in the U.S. by $77.9 million and Canada by $2.2 million compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange rate changes impacted ANS segment net sales unfavorably by approximately 1% during 2022. 55 In 2022, ANS segment operating loss increased and adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to the prior year period. Both ANS segment operating loss and adjusted EBITDA were unfavorably impacted by product mix and decreased sales volumes, but these negative impacts were partially offset by favorable pricing impacts and lower R&D and SG&A costs. For 2022, ANS segment operating loss was unfavorably impacted by a goodwill impairment charge of $1,119.6 million, an increase of $4.6 million of transaction, transformation and integration costs mostly related to the termination of a supply agreement as part of CommScope NEXT and an increase of $3.0 million in restructuring expense but was favorably impacted by a reduction of $2.9 million in intellectual property litigation settlement charges. Goodwill impairment charges, transaction, transformation and integration costs, restructuring expense and intellectual property litigation settlement charges are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA. See the discussion above under "Critical Accounting Policies" for more information regarding the annual goodwill impairment test performed during 2022. Also see Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA within this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below. Home Networks Segment Net sales for the Home segment decreased in 2022 compared to the prior year. While net sales of broadband and video products benefitted from favorable pricing impacts, these increases were more than offset by lower net sales volumes across all our Home segment products primarily due to continued supply shortages. Although we are working to secure components from key suppliers, we still expect to experience some supply chain challenges into 2023 for our Home segment products. From a regional perspective in 2022, net sales decreased in the U.S. by $195.3 million, the APAC region by $35.2 million and the CALA region by $21.2 million but increased in Canada by $90.9 million and the EMEA region by $14.9 million compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange rate changes impacted Home segment net sales unfavorably by approximately 2% during 2022. Home segment operating loss decreased and adjusted EBITDA increased in 2022 compared to the prior year. Both benefitted from favorable pricing impacts, lower bad debt expense and lower warranty costs, but these were partially offset by increased material costs and lower sales volumes. In 2021, Home segment bad debt expense was driven by a $30.3 million charge related to a value-added reseller customer. Home segment operating loss was favorably impacted in 2022 by reductions of $41.6 million in transaction, transformation and integration costs and $7.3 million in restructuring expense. Home segment operating loss in 2021 also included a goodwill impairment charge of $13.7 million. Transaction, transformation and integration costs, restructuring expense and goodwill impairment charges are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA. See Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA within this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes certain key measures of our liquidity and capital resources: December 31, $ % 2022 2021 Change Change (dollars in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 398.1 $ 360.3 $ 37.8 10.5 % Working capital (1) , excluding cash and cash equivalents and current portion of long-term debt 1,252.6 1,068.9 183.7 17.2 Availability under Revolving Credit Facility 908.8 684.1 224.7 32.8 Long-term debt, including current portion 9,501.6 9,510.5 (8.9 ) (0.1 ) Total capitalization (2) 9,055.9 10,410.0 (1,354.1 ) (13.0 ) Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization 104.9 % 91.4 % (1) Working capital consists of current assets of $3,726.2 million less current liabilities of $2,107.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and current assets of $3,579.7 million less current liabilities of $2,182.5 million as of December 31, 2021. (2) Total capitalization includes long-term debt, including the current portion, Series A convertible preferred stock (Convertible Preferred Stock) and stockholders equity (deficit). Our principal sources of liquidity on a short-term basis are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows provided by operations and availability under our credit facilities. On a long-term basis, our potential sources of liquidity also include raising capital through the issuance of additional equity and/or debt. 56 On October 19, 2022, we completed the refinancing of our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility), the main result of which was to extend the maturity to September 30, 2027. We continue to have borrowing capacity up to $1.0 billion, subject to certain limitations, but we have added additional assets under the borrowing base which increases our availability. The interest rate in the amended Revolving Credit Agreement is an adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (SOFR) with a spread of 1.25% to 1.50%. In the first half of 2023, we expect to amend our 2026 Term Loan to replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference interest rate in anticipation of the cessation of LIBOR in 2023. We do not anticipate a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows with the transition to SOFR in our variable rate debt, but the impact is still uncertain. The primary uses of liquidity include debt service requirements, voluntary debt repayments, redemptions or purchases on the open market, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, business separation transaction costs, transformation costs, restructuring costs, dividends related to the Convertible Preferred Stock if we elect to pay such dividends in cash, litigation settlements, income tax payments and other contractual obligations. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from operations, combined with availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated future cash needs. We may experience volatility in cash flows between periods due to, among other reasons, variability in the timing of vendor payments and customer receipts. We may, from time to time, borrow additional amounts under our Revolving Credit Facility or issue debt or equity securities, if market conditions are favorable, to meet future cash needs or to reduce our borrowing costs. Our interest payments on long-term debt are expected to total $2,466.4 million over the duration of the debt, with $635.8 million due in 2023 (assuming interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2022 on our variable rate debt). In 2022, the interest payments on our 2026 Term Loan and our Revolving Credit Facility increased as a result of the Federal Reserve's increase in interest rates in 2022, and we expect that they will continue to raise interest rates into 2023. For additional information regarding our long-term debt obligations, see Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and our discussion of our interest rate risk in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For information on our obligations related to our Convertible Preferred Stock, see Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We periodically enter into sell / buy transactions with our contract manufacturers, where we sell certain component inventory to them for use in our finished goods. We are obligated to subsequently repurchase this inventory either as a finished good or the original component inventory if not used after a specific period of time. We record an accounts receivable and a contract manufacturer inventory repurchase liability related to these transactions. We do not record a sale upon shipment of the inventory to the contract manufacturer and the original value of the inventory remains in our inventory balance. Our current accrued liability related to these transactions is $79.1 million as of December 31, 2022, and we expect to repurchase a portion of this inventory either as a finished good or the original component inventory in 2023. During the normal course of business, to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with our contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to produce and procure inventory based upon our forecasted requirements. We estimate our obligations under these agreements to be $340.0 million as of December 31, 2022. While we believe we have adequate liabilities recorded related to our excess inventory under these purchase commitments, unexpected changes to projected demand may result in us being committed to purchase additional excess inventory to satisfy these commitments and the related charges could be material. We have $124.0 million in unrecognized tax benefits; however, the timing of the related tax payments is highly uncertain. We anticipate a reduction of up to $7.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months. See Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. We are contingently liable under open standby letters of credit issued by our banks to support performance obligations of a third-party contractor that totaled $44.0 million as of December 31, 2022. These amounts represent our estimate of the maximum amounts we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the contractor, but we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover some or all of our losses in the event of the contractor's non-performance. We believe the likelihood of having to perform under these guarantees is remote. There were no material amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements related to third-party guarantee agreements as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. 57 Although there are no financial maintenance covenants under the terms of our senior notes, there is a limitation, among other limitations, on certain future borrowings based on an adjusted leverage ratio or a fixed charge coverage ratio. These ratios are based on financial measures similar to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA as presented in the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures section below, but also give pro forma effect to certain events, including acquisitions, synergies and savings from cost reduction initiatives such as facility closures and headcount reductions. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our non-GAAP pro forma adjusted EBITDA, as measured pursuant to the indentures governing our notes, was $1,327.3 million, which included annualized savings expected from cost reduction initiatives of $50.6 million so that the impact of cost reduction initiatives is fully reflected in the twelve-month period used in the calculation of the ratios. In addition to limitations under these indentures, our senior secured credit facilities contain customary negative covenants based on similar financial measures. We believe we are in compliance with the covenants under our indentures and senior secured credit facilities at December 31, 2022. Cash and cash equivalents increased during 2022 primarily driven by cash generated by operating activities of $190.0 million and proceeds from other investing activities of $19.1 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $101.3 million, our required amortization payments on our 2026 Term Loan totaling $32.0 million, cash dividends paid for the Convertible Preferred Stock of $14.9 million and tax withholding payments for vested equity-based compensation awards of $14.8 million. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 49% of our cash and cash equivalents were held outside the U.S. Working capital, excluding cash and cash equivalents and the current portion of long-term debt, increased during 2022 primarily due to higher inventory balances as a result of rising material costs and increases in stock as we build inventory waiting for certain materials or components to complete our products for sale and lower accounts payable due to the timing of payments. During 2022, we sold accounts receivable under customer-sponsored supplier financing agreements. This had an impact of approximately $78 million on working capital, excluding cash and cash equivalents and the current portion of long-term debt, as of December 31, 2022. Under these agreements, we are able to sell accounts receivable to a bank, and we retain no interest in and have no servicing responsibilities for the accounts receivable sold. The net reduction in total capitalization during 2022 reflected the net loss for the year. Cash Flow Overview Year Ended December 31, $ % 2022 2021 Change Change (dollars in millions) Net cash generated by operating activities $ 190.0 $ 122.3 $ 67.7 55.4 % Net cash used in investing activities (82.1 ) (136.8 ) 54.7 (40.0 ) Net cash used in financing activities (65.0 ) (139.5 ) 74.5 (53.4 ) Operating Activities Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Net loss $ (1,286.9 ) $ (462.6 ) Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash generated by operating activities: Depreciation and amortization 696.1 786.3 Equity-based compensation 61.1 79.6 Deferred income taxes (118.4 ) (147.5 ) Asset impairments 1,119.6 13.7 Changes in assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable (16.0 ) (59.6 ) Inventories (178.8 ) (359.8 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets 30.9 3.2 Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities (43.2 ) 256.0 Other noncurrent assets 8.2 (45.5 ) Other noncurrent liabilities (88.8 ) 8.4 Other 6.2 50.1 Net cash generated by operating activities $ 190.0 $ 122.3 58 During 2022, cash generated by operating activities increased compared to the prior year primarily as a result of better operating performance and lower payments of litigation settlements of $35.1 million, partially offset by higher interest paid of $37.3 million and higher taxes paid of $51.3 million. Investing Activities Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Additions to property, plant and equipment $ (101.3 ) $ (131.4 ) Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment 0.1 13.1 Payments upon settlement of net investment hedge (18.0 ) Other 19.1 (0.5 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (82.1 ) $ (136.8 ) During 2022, the decrease in cash used in investing activities compared to the prior year was primarily driven by lower capital expenditures in the current year and a payment of $18.0 million to settle a net investment hedge in the prior year that did not recur. The increased capital expenditures in 2021 related to the capacity expansion in our CCS segment. Our investments in property, plant and equipment generally relate to supporting improvements and expanding production capacity in manufacturing operations and investing in information technology. Cash used in investing activities was also favorably impacted in the current year by proceeds of $8.2 million on the sale of certain nonfinancial assets, $6.9 million related to the sale of an equity method investment and a return of $4.5 million on equity method investments. Financing Activities Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Long-term debt repaid $ (365.0 ) $ (1,282.0 ) Long-term debt proceeds 333.0 1,250.0 Debt issuance costs (7.2 ) (12.0 ) Debt extinguishment costs (34.4 ) Dividends paid on Series A convertible preferred stock (14.9 ) (43.0 ) Proceeds from the issuance of common shares under equity-based compensation plans 0.1 5.6 Tax withholding payments for vested equity-based compensation awards (14.8 ) (26.4 ) Other 3.8 2.7 Net cash used in financing activities $ (65.0 ) $ (139.5 ) In 2022, we borrowed $333.0 million and repaid $333.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. We also paid four quarterly scheduled amortization payments totaling $32.0 million on our 2026 Term Loan during 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the remaining availability was $908.8 million, reflecting a borrowing base subject to maximum capacity of $1,000.0 million reduced by $91.2 million of letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the refinancing of our Revolving Credit Facility in October 2022, we paid $7.2 million of debt issuance costs. We may continue to look for favorable opportunities to refinance portions of our existing debt to lower borrowing costs, extend the term or adjust the total amount of fixed-rate or floating-rate debt. In 2021, we issued $1,250.0 million of 4.75% senior secured notes due 2029 (the 2029 Secured Notes) and used the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand, to redeem and retire $1,250.0 million outstanding under the 2024 Secured Notes. In connection with the issuance of the 2029 Secured Notes, we paid $9.6 million of debt issuance costs. We paid a redemption premium of $34.4 million to retire the 2024 Secured Notes. We also paid four quarterly scheduled amortization payments totaling $32.0 million on our 2026 Term Loan. 59 Also impacting cash used in financing activities for 2022 was a decrease of $28.1 million in cash dividends paid for the Convertible Preferred Stock. In 2022, we paid cash dividends of $14.9 million and paid $44.1 million of dividends in additional shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock. In 2021, we paid cash dividends of $43.0 million and paid $14.3 million of dividends in additional shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock. During 2022, employees surrendered shares of our common stock to satisfy their tax withholding requirements on vested restricted stock units and performance share units which reduced cash flows by $14.8 million compared to $26.4 million in the prior year. During 2022, we received proceeds of $0.1 million related to the exercise of stock options compared to $5.6 million in the prior year. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures We believe that presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures enhances an investor understanding of our financial performance. We further believe that these financial measures are useful in assessing our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. We also use certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors. We believe these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors. However, our use of the term non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in our industry. This financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to operating income (loss), net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance, operating cash flows or liquidity. Although there are no financial maintenance covenants under the terms of our senior notes, there is a limitation, among other limitations, on certain future borrowings based on an adjusted leverage ratio or a fixed charge coverage ratio. These ratios are based on financial measures similar to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA as presented in this section, but also give pro forma effect to certain events, including acquisitions and savings from cost reduction initiatives such as facility closures and headcount reductions. Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in millions) Net loss $ (1,286.9 ) $ (462.6 ) $ (573.4 ) Income tax benefit (13.1 ) (71.9 ) (81.1 ) Interest income (2.8 ) (1.9 ) (4.4 ) Interest expense 588.9 561.2 577.8 Other expense, net 0.1 23.8 29.3 Operating income (loss) $ (713.8 ) $ 48.6 $ (51.8 ) Adjustments: Amortization of purchased intangible assets 543.0 613.0 630.5 Restructuring costs, net 62.9 91.9 88.4 Equity-based compensation 61.1 79.6 115.0 Asset impairments 1,119.6 13.7 206.7 Transaction, transformation and integration costs (1) 38.2 90.3 24.9 Acquisition accounting adjustments (2) 7.3 11.5 20.6 Patent claims and litigation settlements 28.5 31.7 16.3 Executive severance 6.3 Reserve of Russian accounts receivable 2.7 Depreciation 127.2 136.7 158.3 Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA $ 1,276.7 $ 1,117.0 $ 1,215.2 (1) In 2022, primarily reflects transformation costs related to CommScope NEXT and integration costs related to the ARRIS acquisition. In 2021, primarily reflects transaction separation costs related to the planned separation of the Home segment from CommScope, transformation costs related to CommScope NEXT and integration costs related to the ARRIS acquisition. In 2020, primarily reflects integration costs related to the ARRIS acquisition.

Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices We continually attempt to minimize the effect of inflation on earnings by controlling our operating costs and adjusting our selling prices. The principal raw materials and components purchased by us (aluminum, copper, steel, bimetals, optical fiber, plastics and other polymers, capacitors, memory devices and silicon chips) are subject to changes in market price as they are influenced by commodity markets and other factors. Prices for these items have, at times, been volatile. As a result, we have adjusted our prices for certain products and may have to adjust prices again in the future. To the extent that we are unable to pass on cost increases to customers quickly and without a significant decrease in sales volume or must implement price reductions in response to a rapid decline in raw material costs, these cost changes could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations.
