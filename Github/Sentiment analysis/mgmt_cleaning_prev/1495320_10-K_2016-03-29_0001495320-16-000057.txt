Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and the information contained in other sections of this report, particularly under the headings Risk Factors, Selected Financial Data and Business. This discussion and analysis is based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. The statements in this discussion and analysis concerning expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity, and capital resources, as well as other non-historical statements in this discussion and analysis, are forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under Risk Factors. Our actual results could differ materially from those suggested or implied by any forward-looking statements. Executive summary Fiscal 2016 was the second year of our multi-year turnaround, and we made significant progress against key elements of our long-term strategic plan, laid out in March 2014, focusing on the key planks of product, distribution, and marketing. Specifically: Strategic Progress We made progress on our product strategies, including: Delivering innovation, newness, and diversification through the introduction of several new fabrications, the launch of our Collegiate Collection, and partnering with industry experts to launch our fragrance collection and expand our jewelry collection; Continuing to segment our offerings by channel; and Substantially enhancing our gross profit percentage through sourcing efficiencies, higher penetration of our Made for Outlet ( MFO ) product, and meaningfully reducing our promotional activity. We made progress on our distribution strategies, including: Opening 15 full-line stores, all in our new modern store design; Opening 11 factory outlet stores and successfully transitioning to a MFO model; Making key enhancements to verabradley.com, including enhanced search, which improved conversion; and Nearly doubling our department store presence at Macy s, adding distribution at select Belk and Bon-Ton stores, and beginning our Amazon partnership. We began to modernize our marketing and increase brand and product awareness through: Launching our multi-media national ad campaign; Increasing investment in social media, which resulted in a significant increase in the size of our social community as well as coverage by a broader range of fashion and lifestyle bloggers; Securing editorial and media attention in such fashion publications as Elle, In Style and Teen Vogue, as well as from online partners such as Pandora, SheKnows, Polyvore, and Spotify ; and Introducing our Campus Ambassador program on several college campuses.

Discontinued Operations In June 2014, we entered into a five-year agreement with Mitsubishi Corporation Fashion Company and Look Inc. for the importation and distribution of Vera Bradley products in Japan. As a result of moving to this wholesale business model, we exited our direct business in Japan during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and have accounted for it as a discontinued operation. Consolidated income statement and Direct segment results for the current and prior periods presented are reported on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise stated. Restructuring and Other Charges Affecting Comparability of the Year-to-Date Periods ended January 30, 2016, and January 31, 2015 In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company closed its manufacturing facility located in New Haven, Indiana. The Company incurred restructuring and other charges during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 of approximately $3.4 million ($2.1 million after the associated tax benefit), related to the facility closing, as compared to $3.0 million ($1.9 million after the associated tax benefit), primarily related to raw materials inventory write-downs, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The fiscal 2016 charges include severance and benefit costs of approximately $1.7 million, lease termination costs of approximately $0.7 million, inventory-related charges of approximately $0.6 million, and other associated net costs, which include accelerated depreciation related to fixed assets, of approximately $0.4 million. These charges are reflected in cost of sales in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Management expects that the facility closure will reduce operating costs by approximately $12.0 million annually beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. All production from the facility will be absorbed by the Company third party manufacturing suppliers. Additional charges affecting comparability of the financial results for the fifty-two weeks ended January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 totaled approximately $3.1 million ($2.1 million after the associated tax benefit) consisting of charges in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 of $1.3 million in employee severance (reflected in selling, general, and administrative expenses), $1.2 million due to a retail store early lease termination agreement (reflected in selling, general, and administrative expenses), and $0.6 million related to an increase in income tax reserves for uncertain federal and state tax positions related to research and development tax credits (reflected in income tax expense). See Note 15 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, herein, for additional information. How We Assess the Performance of Our Business In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. Net Revenues Net revenues reflect revenues from the sale of our merchandise and from distribution and shipping and handling fees, less returns and discounts. Revenues for the Direct segment reflect sales through our full-line and factory outlet stores, verabradley.com, direct-to-consumer eBay sales, and our annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Revenues for the Indirect segment reflect sales to specialty retail partners, department stores, national accounts, third party e-commerce sites, our wholesale business in Japan, and third party inventory liquidators. As of January 30, 2016 , our specialty retail locations have decreased to approximately 2,600 locations from their peak during fiscal 2013 of approximately 3,600 locations. We believe hyper-promotional activity, which we define as discounts of 60% or more, has been damaging to our brand. Accordingly, we strategically reduced our use of this type of promotion both in our Direct stores and on verabradley.com during fiscal 2016. 33 Table of Contents Comparable Sales Comparable sales (including e-commerce) are calculated based upon our stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months and net revenues from our e-commerce operations. Comparable store sales are calculated based solely upon our stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months. Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales and comparable store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage. Some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales differently than we do. As a result, data in this report regarding our comparable sales and comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other companies. Non-comparable sales include sales from stores not included in comparable sales or comparable store sales. Measuring the change in year-over-year comparable sales allows us to evaluate how our store base and e-commerce operations are performing. Various factors affect our comparable sales, including: Overall economic trends; Consumer preferences and fashion trends; Competition; Timing of our releases of new patterns and collections; Changes in our product mix; Pricing and level of promotions; Level of customer service that we provide in stores; Our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; Number of stores we open and close in any period; and Timing and success of promotional and advertising efforts. In recent years, comparable store sales have declined. With that in mind, we are slowing our full-line store opening plan in fiscal 2017 to four new stores from an average of approximately 20 new stores in prior years. We will continue to evaluate our plans for store openings in future years in light of demand and store performance. Gross Profit Gross profit is equal to our net revenues less our cost of sales. Cost of sales includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise, distribution center costs, operations overhead, duty, and all inbound freight costs incurred. The components of our reported cost of sales may not be comparable to those of other retail and wholesale companies. Gross profit can be impacted by changes in volume; fluctuations in sales price; operational efficiencies, such as leveraging of fixed costs; promotional activities, such as free shipping; commodity prices, such as cotton prices; and labor costs. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (SG&A) SG&A expenses include selling; advertising, marketing, and product development; and administrative. Selling expenses include Direct business expenses such as store expenses, employee compensation, and store occupancy and supply costs, as well as Indirect business expenses consisting primarily of employee compensation and other expenses associated with sales to Indirect retailers. Advertising, marketing, and product development expenses include employee compensation, media costs, creative production expenses, marketing agency fees, new product design costs, public relations expenses, and market research expenses. A portion of our advertising expenses may be reimbursed by Indirect retailers, and such amount is classified as other income. Administrative expenses include employee compensation for corporate functions, corporate headquarters occupancy costs, consulting and software expenses, and charitable donations. Other Income We support many of our Indirect retailers marketing efforts by distributing certain catalogs and promotional mailers to current and prospective customers. Our Indirect retailers reimburse us for a portion of the cost to produce these materials. Reimbursement received is recorded as other income. The related cost to design, produce, and distribute the catalogs and mailers is recorded as SG&A expense. Other income also includes proceeds from the sales of tickets to our annual outlet sale. 34 Table of Contents Operating Income Operating income is equal to gross profit less SG&A expenses plus other income. Operating income excludes interest income, interest expense, and income taxes. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations is equal to operating income less net interest expense and income taxes. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, is equal to the loss from the results of operations related to the direct Japan business, which was exited in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, adjusted for the associated tax benefit. Net Income Net income is equal to the sum of income from continuing operations and loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes. Results of Operations The following tables summarize key components of our consolidated results of operations for the last three fiscal years, both in dollars and as a percentage of our net revenues. Fiscal Year Ended (1) ($ in thousands) January 30, 2016 January 31, 2015 February 1, 2014 Statement of Income Data (2) : Net revenues $ 502,598 $ 508,990 $ 530,896 Cost of sales 221,409 239,981 238,684 Gross profit 281,189 269,009 292,212 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 236,836 208,675 201,231 Other income 2,369 3,736 4,776 Operating income 46,722 64,070 95,757 Interest expense, net 263 407 571 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 46,459 63,663 95,186 Income tax expense 18,901 22,828 35,057 Income from continuing operations 27,558 40,835 60,129 Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes (2,386 ) (1,317 ) Net income $ 27,558 $ 38,449 $ 58,812 Percentage of Net Revenues: Net revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 44.1 % 47.1 % 45.0 % Gross profit 55.9 % 52.9 % 55.0 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses 47.1 % 41.0 % 37.9 % Other income 0.5 % 0.7 % 0.9 % Operating income 9.3 % 12.6 % 18.0 % Interest expense, net 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.1 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes 9.2 % 12.5 % 17.9 % Income tax expense 3.8 % 4.5 % 6.6 % Income from continuing operations 5.5 % 8.0 % 11.3 % Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes % (0.5 )% (0.2 )% Net income 5.5 % 7.6 % 11.1 % 35 Table of Contents The following tables present net revenues by operating segment, both in dollars and as a percentage of our net revenues, and full-line and factory outlet store data for the last three fiscal years: Fiscal Year Ended (1) ($ in thousands, except as otherwise indicated) January 30, 2016 January 31, 2015 February 1, 2014 Net Revenues by Segment (2) : Direct $ 351,286 $ 335,602 $ 321,092 Indirect 151,312 173,388 209,804 Total $ 502,598 $ 508,990 $ 530,896 Percentage of Net Revenues by Segment: Direct 69.9 % 65.9 % 60.5 % Indirect 30.1 % 34.1 % 39.5 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Fiscal Year Ended January 30, 2016 January 31, 2015 February 1, 2014 Store Data (3) : Total stores open at end of period 150 125 99 Comparable sales (including e-commerce) (decrease) increase (4) (10.6 )% (7.6 )% (1.3 )% Total gross square footage at end of period 342,362 278,779 207,096 Average net revenues per gross square foot (5) $ 703 $ 760 $ 887 (1) The Company utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. Fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 consisted of 52 weeks. (2) Financial data recasts Japan results of operations as discontinued operations for all years presented. Japan was formerly included in the Direct segment results. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (3) Includes full-line and factory outlet stores. (4) Comparable sales (including e-commerce) are calculated based upon our stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months and net revenues from our e-commerce operations. Increase or decrease is reported as a percentage of the comparable sales for the same period in the prior fiscal year. Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage. (5) Dollars not in thousands. Average net revenues per gross square foot are calculated by dividing total net revenues for our stores that have been open at least 12 full fiscal months as of the end of the period by total gross square footage for those stores. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Net Revenues For fiscal 2016 , net revenues decreased $6.4 million , or 1.3% , to $502.6 million , from $509.0 millio n for fiscal 2015 . Direct. For fiscal 2016 , net revenues increased $15.7 million , or 4.7% , to $351.3 million , from $335.6 million for fiscal 2015 . This change resulted from a $51.3 million contribution of revenue from our non-comparable stores, which included 26 additional stores in the current year, partially offset by a comparable sales (including e-commerce) decrease of $33.7 million , or 10.6% and a gift card breakage revenue decrease of $1.1 million . Fiscal 2015 was the first year gift card breakage revenue was recognized; refer to Note 2, herein, for additional information. The decrease in comparable sales (including e-commerce) includes a 13.2% decrease in e-commerce sales and an 8.6% decrease in comparable store sales, primarily as a result of reduced traffic. There was also a decrease in sales at our annual outlet sale compared to the prior fiscal year. We believe the year-over-year traffic declines in e-commerce and stores are due, at least in part, to our intentional reduction of promotional activity. The aggregate number of full-line and factory outlet stores grew from 125 at the end of fiscal 2015 , to 150 at the end of fiscal 2016 , which includes the closure of one full-line store in fiscal 2016 . Indirect. For fiscal 2016 , net revenues decreased $22.1 million , or 12.7% , to $151.3 million , from $173.4 million for fiscal 2015 , primarily due to lower orders from specialty retail accounts, as well as a reduction in the number of specialty retailers. 36 Table of Contents Gross Profit For fiscal 2016 , gross profit increased $12.2 million , or 4.5% , to $281.2 million , from $269.0 million for fiscal 2015 . As a percentage of net revenues, gross profit increased to 55.9% for fiscal 2016 , from 52.9% for fiscal 2015 . The year-over-year increase in the gross margin rate was primarily related to sourcing efficiencies (lower product costs combined with Fall 2014 cost reductions at the Company domestic manufacturing facility as well as leverage of overhead costs resulting from an increase in units manufactured), increased sales penetration of higher-margin MFO products, reduced promotional activity and lower levels of liquidation sales. Gross profit during fiscal 2016 was impacted by restructuring charges of $3.4 million related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, as discussed in more detail in Note 15 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A) For fiscal 2016 , SG&A expenses increased $28.1 million , or 13.5% , to $236.8 millio n, from $208.7 million for fiscal 2015 . As a percentage of net revenues, SG&A expenses were 47.1% and 41.0% for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 , respectively. The increase in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2016 included $1.3 million in employee severance expense and $1.2 million in expense related to a retail store early termination agreement that did not occur in the comparable prior year period. The remaining increase was primarily due to investments in new stores, $6.0 million in incremental marketing and advertising, $2.7 million in additional incentive compensation, as well as $2.3 million in incremental store impairment charges. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to the aforementioned items, as well as fixed expenses being spread over lower revenues and deleveraging of store operating expenses as a result of lower comparable store sales. Other Income For fiscal 2016 , other income decreased $1.3 million , or 36.6% , to $2.4 million , from $3.7 million for fiscal 2015 , primarily due to a decrease in reimbursement of co-op mailer expense from Indirect retailers. Operating Income For fiscal 2016 , operating income decreased $17.4 million , or 27.1% , to $46.7 million , from $64.1 million for fiscal 2015 . As a percentage of net revenues, operating income was 9.3% and 12.6% for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 , respectively. Operating income for fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by the $5.9 million in restructuring and other charges described above under Gross Profit and Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. The remaining decrease in operating income was due to an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses and a decrease in other income, partially offset by an increase in gross profit, as described above. The following table provides additional information about our operating income (in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended $ Change % Change January 30, 2016 January 31, 2015 Operating Income: Direct $ 74,114 $ 74,099 $ 15 % Indirect 60,409 66,213 (5,804 ) (8.8 )% Less: Unallocated corporate expenses (87,801 ) (76,242 ) (11,559 ) 15.2 % Operating income $ 46,722 $ 64,070 $ (17,348 ) (27.1 )% Direct . For fiscal 2016 , the change in operating income was essentially flat. As a percentage of Direct segment net revenues, operating income in the Direct segment was 21.1% and 22.1% for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Operating income for fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by the $3.5 million , or 1.0% as a percentage of Direct segment net revenues, in restructuring and other charges related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and a retail store early termination agreement. Indirect . For fiscal 2016 , operating income decreased $5.8 million , or 8.8% . As a percentage of Indirect segment net revenues, operating income in the Indirect segment was 39.9% and 38.2% for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The increase in operating income as a percentage of Indirect segment net revenues was primarily due to an increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, as described above. This increase was partially offset by $1.1 million , or 0.8% as a percentage of Indirect segment net revenues, in restructuring charges related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. 37 Table of Contents Corporate Unallocated . For fiscal 2016 , unallocated expenses increased $11.6 million , or 15.2% . The increase in unallocated expenses included $1.3 million in employee severance expense. The remaining increase was primarily due to incremental marketing and advertising investments, an increase in incentive compensation due to Company performance, as well as an increase in depreciation expense primarily as a result of the campus consolidation. Interest Expense, Net. For fiscal 2016 , net interest expense decreased $0.1 million , or 35.4% , to $0.3 million , from $0.4 million in fiscal 2015 . Income Tax Expense. For fiscal 2016 , we recorded income tax expense of $18.9 million at an effective tax rate of 40.7% , compared to 35.9% for fiscal 2015 . The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to one-time decreases to tax expense in fiscal 2015 that did not occur in fiscal 2016, as well as increases in permanent tax exclusions in fiscal 2016 including an increase in income tax reserves for uncertain federal and state tax positions related to research and development tax credits from prior years. Income from Continuing Operations For fiscal 2016 , income from continuing operations decreased $13.2 million , or 32.5% , to $27.6 million from $40.8 million in fiscal 2015 . Included in this decrease were restructuring and other charges of $6.5 million ($4.2 million after the associated tax benefit), as described in Note 15 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes For fiscal 2015, loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes was $2.4 million reflecting the exit of the direct Japan business in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Net Income For fiscal 2016 , net income decreased $10.8 million , or 28.3% , to $27.6 million from $38.4 million in fiscal 2015 . Included in this decrease were restructuring and other charges of $6.5 million ($4.2 million after the associated tax benefit), as described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 Net Revenues For fiscal 2015, net revenues decreased $21.9 million, or 4.1%, to $509.0 million, from $530.9 million for fiscal 2014. Direct. For fiscal 2015, net revenues increased $14.5 million, or 4.5%, to $335.6 million, from $321.1 million for fiscal 2014. This change resulted from a $39.8 million increase in revenues at our non-comparable stores which included 27 additional full-line and factory outlet stores and gift card breakage revenue of $1.4 million along with a comparable sales (including e-commerce) decrease of $23.1 million, or 7.6% (which includes a 3.9% increase in e-commerce sales). Our comparable store sales decreased 16.1%. Comparable sales (including e-commerce) and comparable store sales were negatively impacted by year-over-year declines in store traffic. The aggregate number of full-line and factory outlet stores grew from 99 at the end of fiscal 2014, to 125 at the end of fiscal 2015, which includes the closure of one full-line store in fiscal 2015. Indirect. For fiscal 2015, net revenues decreased $36.4 million, or 17.4%, to $173.4 million, from $209.8 million for fiscal 2014, primarily due to lower orders from the Company's specialty retail accounts, as well as a reduction in the number of specialty retailers. Gross Profit For fiscal 2015, gross profit decreased $23.2 million, or 7.9%, to $269.0 million, from $292.2 million for fiscal 2014. As a percentage of net revenues, gross profit decreased to 52.9% for fiscal 2015, from 55.0% for fiscal 2014. The year-over-year decline in gross margin rate was primarily related to increased year-over-year promotional activity. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A) For fiscal 2015, SG&A expenses increased $7.5 million, or 3.7%, to $208.7 million, from $201.2 million for fiscal 2014. As a percentage of net revenues, SG&A expenses were 41.0% and 37.9% for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percent of net revenues was primarily due to strategic investments which include new store expenses, key management additions and marketing and e-commerce initiatives. 38 Table of Contents Other Income For fiscal 2015, other income decreased $1.1 million, or 21.8%, to $3.7 million, from $4.8 million for fiscal 2014. The decrease in other income was in line with a decrease in associated advertising costs related to mailers for our specialty retailers. Operating Income For fiscal 2015, operating income decreased $31.7 million, or 33.1%, to $64.1 million, from $95.8 million for fiscal 2014. As a percentage of net revenues, operating income was 12.6% and 18.0% for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. The following table provides additional information about our operating income (in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended $ Change % Change January 31, 2015 February 1, 2014 Operating Income: Direct $ 74,099 $ 81,194 $ (7,095 ) (8.7 )% Indirect 66,213 84,130 (17,917 ) (21.3 )% Less: Unallocated corporate expenses (76,242 ) (69,567 ) (6,675 ) 9.6 % Operating income $ 64,070 $ 95,757 $ (31,687 ) (33.1 )% Direct . For fiscal 2015, operating income decreased $7.1 million, or 8.7%. As a percentage of Direct segment net revenues, operating income in the Direct segment was 22.1% and 25.3% for fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. Indirect . For fiscal 2015, operating income decreased $17.9 million, or 21.3%. As a percentage of Indirect segment net revenues, operating income in the Indirect segment was 38.2% and 40.1% for fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. Corporate Unallocated . For fiscal 2015, unallocated expenses increased $6.7 million, or 9.6%, primarily due to key management additions and marketing initiatives. Interest Expense, Net. For fiscal 2015, net interest expense decreased $0.2 million, or 28.7%, to $0.4 million, from $0.6 million in fiscal 2014. The decrease was due primarily to no borrowings occurring during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. Income Tax Expense. For fiscal 2015, we recorded income tax expense of $22.8 million at an effective tax rate of 35.9%, compared to 36.8% for fiscal 2014. Income from Continuing Operations For fiscal 2015, income from continuing operations decreased $19.3 million, or 32.1%, to $40.8 million from $60.1 million in fiscal 2014. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes For fiscal 2015, loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes increased $1.1 million to $2.4 million from $1.3 million in fiscal 2014, reflecting the exit of the direct Japan business in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to the write-off of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments. Net Income For fiscal 2015, net income decreased $20.4 million, or 34.6%, to $38.4 million from $58.8 million in fiscal 2014. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. We also have access to additional liquidity, if needed, through borrowings under our $125.0 million second amended and restated credit agreement. Historically, our primary cash needs have been for merchandise inventories; payroll; store rent; capital expenditures associated with operational equipment, buildings, information technology, and opening new stores; and debt repayments. The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, merchandise inventories, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current liabilities. 39 Table of Contents We believe that cash flows from operating activities and the availability of borrowings under our second amended and restated credit agreement will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, share repurchases, and debt payments for the foreseeable future. Cash Flow Analysis A summary of operating, investing, and financing activities is shown in the following table (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 30, 2016 January 31, 2015 February 1, 2014 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 43,270 $ 103,812 $ 87,864 Net cash used in investing activities (26,322 ) (37,128 ) (22,862 ) Net cash used in financing activities (31,531 ) (13,604 ) (15,313 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation, the effect of changes in assets and liabilities, and tenant-improvement allowances received from landlords under our store leases. Net cash provided by operating activities was $43.3 million during fiscal 2016 , as compared to $103.8 million during fiscal 2015 . The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in net income of $10.9 million and changes in assets and liabilities which provided an $8.8 million use of cash as compared to a $45.3 million source of cash in the prior year, primarily as a result of inventories, accounts payable and income taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $103.8 million during fiscal 2015, as compared to $87.9 million during fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily due to a reduction in inventory of $44.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in net income and accounts payable of $20.4 million and $10.0 million, respectively. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for growth related to new store openings, buildings, operational equipment, and information technology investments. Net cash used in investing activities was $26.3 million in fiscal 2016 , compared to $37.1 million in fiscal 2015 . The $10.8 million decrease in capital expenditures was driven primarily by the campus consolidation which was substantially completed in fiscal 2015. Net cash used in investing activities was $37.1 million in fiscal 2015, compared to $22.9 million in fiscal 2014. The $14.2 million increase in capital expenditures was driven primarily by the campus consolidation and the cost associated with the opening of four additional stores during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately $20.0 million . Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $31.5 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $13.6 million in fiscal 2015 . The $17.9 million increase in financing activities was primarily due to the completion of purchases of shares of the Company's common stock made under the 2014 Share Repurchase Program, as well as purchases under the 2015 Share Repurchase Program. Net cash used in financing activities was $13.6 million in fiscal 2015 which was primarily related to purchases of shares of the Company's common stock made under the 2014 Share Repurchase Program. This compares to net cash used in financing activities of $15.3 million in fiscal 2014, primarily resulting from $15.0 million net payments under our amended and restated credit agreement. Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On July 15, 2015, Vera Bradley Designs, Inc. ( VBD ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement among VBD, the lenders from time to time party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as syndication agent, and KeyBank National Association, as documentation agent (the Credit Agreement ), which amended and restated our prior credit 40 Table of Contents agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for certain credit facilities to VBD in an aggregate principal amount not to initially exceed $125.0 million, the proceeds of which will be used for general corporate purposes of VBD and its subsidiaries, including but not limited to Vera Bradley International, LLC and Vera Bradley Sales, LLC (collectively, the Named Subsidiaries ). Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at VBD's option, at a per annum rate equal to either (A) the Alternate Base Rate ( ABR ) plus the Applicable Margin, where the ABR is the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) Adjusted LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1%, and the Applicable Margin is a percentage ranging from 0.00% to 0.70% depending upon the Company's leverage ratio or (B) Adjusted LIBOR plus the Applicable Margin, where Adjusted LIBOR means LIBOR, as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities, and Applicable Margin is a percentage ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% depending upon the Company's leverage ratio. Any loans made, or letters of credit issued, pursuant to the Credit Agreement mature on July 15, 2020. As of January 30, 2016 , the Company had borrowing availability of $125.0 million under the agreement. VBD's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and the Named Subsidiaries. The obligations of VBD under the Credit Agreement are secured by first priority security interests in all of the respective assets of VBD, the Company, and the Named Subsidiaries and a pledge of the equity interests of VBD and the Named Subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement contains various restrictive covenants, including restrictions on the Company's ability to dispose of assets, make acquisitions or investments, incur debt or liens, make distributions to stockholders or repurchase outstanding stock, enter into related party transactions and make capital expenditures, other than upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Company is also required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum ratio of EBITDAR to the sum of interest expense plus rentals (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and a limit on capital expenditures. Upon an event of default, which includes certain customary events such as, among other things, a failure to make required payments when due, a failure to comply with covenants, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, a material adverse change (as defined in the Credit Agreement), defaults under other material indebtedness, and a change in control, the lenders may accelerate amounts outstanding, terminate the agreement and foreclose on all collateral. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of January 30, 2016 . Contractual Obligations We enter into long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily non-cancellable operating leases. As of January 30, 2016 , our contractual cash obligations over the next several periods are as follows: Payments Due by Period (3) ($ in thousands) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More Than 5 Years Operating leases (1) $ 221,047 $ 30,585 $ 59,621 $ 54,220 $ 76,621 Purchase obligations (2) 42,373 42,373 Total $ 263,420 $ 72,958 $ 59,621 $ 54,220 $ 76,621 (1) Our store leases generally range from five to ten years with varying renewal options. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we were to extend these leases, or if we were to enter into new operating leases. (2) Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases. (3) Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our uncertain tax positions at January 30, 2016 , we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $3.1 million of uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosures relating to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our accounting policies, estimates, and judgments on an on-going basis. We base our 41 Table of Contents estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We evaluate the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and believe that the following policies and estimates involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position, and are therefore discussed as critical. The following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent results of operations. Our historical results for the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, however, have not been materially impacted by such variances. More information on all of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of our products is recognized upon customer receipt of the product when collection of the associated receivables is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, which, for e-commerce and most Indirect sales, reflects an estimate of shipments that customers have not yet received. The adjustment of these shipments is based on actual delivery dates to the customer. Significant changes in shipping terms or delivery times could materially impact our revenues in a given period. We reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. In the Direct business returns are refunded by issuing the same payment tender of the original purchase and in the Indirect business the customer is issued a credit to its account to apply to outstanding invoices. Merchandise exchanges of the same product at the same price are not considered merchandise returns. Product returns are often resalable through our annual outlet sale or other channels. Additionally, we reserve for other potential product credits and for customer shipments not yet received. The balance of the reserve for returns, customer shipments not yet received, and general credits was $3.3 million and $3.7 million as of January 30, 2016 , and January 31, 2015 , respectively. We sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers and do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards. Gift cards that we issue are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed, at which point revenue is recognized. In addition, we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions. We determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method. Market is determined based on net realizable value, which includes costs to dispose. Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excess quantities, and other factors, including the popularity of a pattern or product, in evaluating net realizable value. We record valuation adjustments to our inventories, which are reflected in cost of sales, if the cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. This adjustment calculation requires us to make assumptions and estimates, which are based on factors such as merchandise seasonality, historical trends, and estimated sales and inventory levels, including sell-through of remaining units. In addition, as part of inventory adjustments, we provide for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from our physical inventory counts. We perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrinkage provision accordingly. The balance of inventory adjustments was $5.5 million and $9.7 million for these matters as of the fiscal years ended January 30, 2016 , and January 31, 2015 , respectively. These adjustments related primarily to raw materials of retired patterns and styles and merchandise from the baby gift category, which was discontinued by the Company, and technology accessories. Fiscal 2015 included a raw materials reserve related to the closure of our domestic manufacturing facility. We have the ability to move retired finished goods through a number of channels, including the annual outlet sale, our website and factory outlet stores, and through third-party liquidators as needed. 42 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is based on our pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained; (2) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. Taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns. We believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable. Taxing authorities, however, may take a contrary position. Our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if, upon final resolution with taxing authorities, we prevail in positions for which we have established reserves, or are required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. Valuation of Long-lived Assets Property, plant, and equipment assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In evaluating an asset for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset at the store level, the lowest identifiable level of cash flow, if applicable. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset is less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, usually determined by an estimated discounted cash flow analysis of the asset. Factors used in the valuation of long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, our plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results, and projected future cash flows. With respect to our stores, we analyze store economics, location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and desirable co-tenancies in our selection process. Impairment charges are classified in SG&A expenses and were $2.8 million and $0.4 million for the periods ended January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , respectively. The discounted cash flow models used to estimate the applicable fair values involve numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective. Changes to these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the fair value estimates. The estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include: (1) estimated future cash flow generated at the store level; and (2) discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair values. These and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and our expectations and may change in the future based on period-specific facts and circumstances. If economic conditions were to deteriorate, future impairment charges may be required.
