Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion also contains forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section generally discusses the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the four months ended April 30, 2021, and the eight months ended December 31, 2021, please refer to Part II, Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. References herein to we or our include references to our Predecessor, our Successor, or to our Predecessor and Successor on a combined basis, as the context may require . Business Overview Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. is a leading communications and technology provider offering gigabit speeds to approximately 2.9 million broadband subscribers, with approximately 13,300 employees, operating in 25 states as of December 31, 2023. We are building critical infrastructure across the country with our fiber-optic network and cloud-based solutions, enabling secure high-speed connections. Driven by our purpose of Building Gigabit America TM , we are focused on supporting a digital society, closing the digital divide, and working toward a more sustainable environment. In 2020, we began the expansion and transformation of our fiber network to meet the rapidly increasing demand for data from our consumer and business customers. We believe that a fiber network has competitive advantages to be able to meet this growing demand, including faster download speeds, faster upload speeds, and lower latency levels than alternative broadband services. In August 2021, we announced our plan to pass 10 million total locations with fiber. We are prioritizing our activities to locations that we believe will provide the highest investment returns. Over time, we expect our business mix will shift significantly, with a larger percentage of revenue coming from fiber as we implement our expansion plan. Our strategy focuses on four strategic priorities : fiber deployment, fiber penetration, operational efficiency, and improving the customer experience. We accomplished the following objectives in 2023: We passed 1.3 million new fiber locations. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 6.5 million total locations passed with fiber. We added 318,000 fiber broadband customer net additions, resulting in fiber broadband customer growth of 19% as compared to the prior year. Fiber broadband customer net additions continued to outpace copper broadband customer net losses, resulting in 75,000 total broadband customer net additions. Consumer fiber revenue growth of 11% offset consumer copper revenue declines of 14%, resulting in overall positive consumer revenue growth for the second half of 2023. We achieved our annualized gross run rate cost savings target of $500 million at the end of 2023 double our initial goal of $250 million. As of December 31, 2023, we had realized $527 million of gross annualized cost savings since 2021. We completed a $2.1 billion offering of secured fiber revenue term notes in August 2023, consisting of $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of secured fiber network revenue term notes and a $500 million fiber network revenue variable funding senior notes facility. We announced the relocation of our corporate headquarters from Norwalk, Connecticut to Dallas, Texas. Our fiber build plans include significant expenditures which could be adversely impacted by supply chain delays, actual or perceived inflation, tight labor markets, increased fuel and electricity costs, increases in the cost of borrowing, and other risks. In addition to higher costs, the availability of building materials and other supply chain risks could negatively impact our ability to achieve the fiber build plans we are executing against. During 2023, markets remained volatile, and the economic outlook was uncertain. We continue to closely monitor and evaluate the impact these and other factors may have on our business, including demand for our products and services, our ability to execute on our strategic priorities and our financial condition and results of operations. 29 Financial Overview Operating Income We reported operating income of $492 million and $592 million, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $100 million. Operating income decreased primarily due to decreases in revenue from voice and video services and increases in depreciation and amortization expense. These factors were partially offset by an increase in data and internet services revenue, as well as decreases in selling, general and administrative expenses and other charges as compared to 2022. Presentation of Results of Operations The sections below include tables that present customer counts, average monthly consumer revenue per customer ( ARPC ), average monthly revenue per unit ( ARPU ), and consumer customer churn. We define churn as the number of consumer customer deactivations during the month divided by the number of consumer customers at the beginning of the month and utilize the average of each monthly churn in the period. Management believes that consumer customer counts, ARPC, ARPU, and consumer customer churn are important factors in evaluating our consumer customer trends. Among the key services we provide to consumer customers are voice service, data service and video service. We continue to explore the potential to provide additional services to our customer base, with the objective of meeting our customers communications needs. (a) Results of Operations Customer Trends As of or for the year ended December 31, (Customer, Subscriber, and Employee Metrics in thousands) 2023 2022 % Change Broadband Customer Metrics (1) Fiber Broadband Consumer customers 1,878 1,575 19 % Business and wholesale customers 129 114 13 % Consumer net customer additions 303 239 27 % Consumer customer churn 1.32% 1.38% (4) % Consumer customer ARPU $ 63.39 $ 62.45 2 % Copper Broadband Consumer customers 822 1,043 (21) % Business and wholesale customers 114 136 (16) % Consumer net customer losses (221) (191) 16 % Consumer customer churn 1.90% 1.79% 6 % Consumer customer ARPU $ 52.43 $ 48.13 9 % Consumer Customer Metrics Customers 3,129 3,133 (0) % Net customer losses (4) (32) (88) % ARPC $ 82.53 $ 82.30 0 % Customer Churn 1.52% 1.54% (1) % Other Metrics Employees 13,297 14,708 (10) % (1) Historical amounts have been updated to include related metrics for our wholesale customers. We provide service and product options in our consumer and business offerings in each of our markets. 30 Fiber Broadband Customers Our investment strategy is focused on expanding our fiber network. In conjunction with this strategy, we are also working to improve our product positioning in both existing and new fiber markets. The quarter ended December 31, 2023 represents the eighteenth consecutive quarter of positive fiber net adds. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we added approximately 303,000 consumer fiber broadband customers compared to approximately 239,000 in 2022 . Customers who migrated from our copper base constituted a minor portion of these consumer fiber broadband customer net additions in 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we added approximately 15,000 business and wholesale fiber broadband customers compared to approximately 13,000 in 2022. Our focus on expanding and improving our fiber network has contributed to healthy customer retention. Our average monthly consumer fiber broadband churn was 1.32% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 1.38% in 2022. These improvements were driven by our increased focus on key customer touchpoints such as installation and first bill and reflect the end of certain promotion pricing periods as well as, retention activities associated with inflation-related pricing actions. o The average monthly consumer fiber broadband revenue per customer ( consumer ARPU ) increased $0.94, or 2%, to $63.39 in 2023, compared to $62.45 in 2022. o The increase in consumer ARPU for the year ended December 31, 2023 was due to higher intake pricing, customer shifts to higher broadband speeds, customers rolling off promotional pricing, and lower gift card redemptions, all partially offset by increased retention activity and autopay take rates. Copper Broadband Customers For the year ended December 31, 2023, we lost approximately 221,000 consumer copper broadband customers compared to a loss of approximately 191,000 in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we lost approximately 22,000 business and wholesale copper broadband customers compared to a loss of approximately 20,000 in 2022. Our average monthly consumer copper broadband churn was 1.90% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 1.79% in 2022. The increase in consumer copper broadband churn was driven by the impact of inflationary price increases and changes to our copper broadband go to market approach which impacted gross add volume. Consumer Customers We experienced a decrease in consumer customers of less than 1% as of December 31, 2023, as compared to December 31, 2022. Consumer customer losses were driven by reductions in our copper broadband and stand-alone voice customers, partially offset by net additions of fiber broadband customers. Customer preferences as well as our fiber investment initiatives resulted in an increase in the number of our consumer broadband customers and a migration of our customer base to fiber. We lost approximately 4,000 consumer customers for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a loss of approximately 32,000 consumer customers for the year ended December 31, 2022, driven by losses in copper broadband, voice and video customers, offset by growth in fiber broadband customers. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we experienced a net gain of consumer broadband customers of approximately 82,000 as compared to a net gain of approximately 48,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. o The average monthly consumer revenue per customer ( consumer ARPC ) increased $0.23, or less than 1%, to $82.53 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the prior year period. The slight increase was driven primarily by growth in fiber data and value-added services along with price increases, partially offset by declines in voice and video services. We have de-emphasized the sale of low margin video products, which has historically been a material part of the overall ARPC. Going forward, we expect moderate movements in ARPC as our customer mix becomes more weighted towards broadband services. 31 Financial Results For the year ended For the year ended December 31, December 31, ( $ in millions ) 2023 2022 Data and Internet services $ 3,534 $ 3,390 Voice services 1,373 1,498 Video services 430 520 Other 339 325 Revenue from contracts with customers 5,676 5,733 Subsidy and other revenue 75 54 Revenue 5,751 5,787 Operating expenses: Cost of service 2,125 2,169 Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,646 1,745 Depreciation and amortization 1,415 1,182 Restructuring costs and other charges 73 99 Total operating expenses $ 5,259 $ 5,195 Operating income 492 592 Consumer 3,097 3,116 Business and wholesale 2,579 2,617 Revenue from contracts with customers $ 5,676 $ 5,733 Fiber revenue 2,997 2,769 Copper revenue 2,679 2,964 Revenue from contracts with customers $ 5,676 $ 5,733 REVENUE The table below presents our revenue by technology for the periods indicated: For the year ended For the year ended December 31, December 31, $ Increase % Increase ( $ in millions ) 2023 2022 (Decrease) (Decrease) Fiber $ 2,997 $ 2,769 $ 228 8 % Copper 2,679 2,964 (285) (10) % Revenue from contracts with customers (1) 5,676 5,733 (57) (1) % Subsidy revenue 75 54 21 39 % Total revenue $ 5,751 $ 5,787 $ (36) (1) % (1) Includes $62 million and $63 million of lease revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our revenue streams are primarily a result of recurring data, voice, and video services delivered over our fiber and copper network. Revenues are considered fiber or copper based on the last-mile technology used to connect the customer location. With our investment strategy to expand and improve our fiber network and the corresponding fiber focus of our sales and marketing efforts, we are experiencing growth in fiber broadband revenue and a decline in copper revenue. We expect this trend to continue and accelerate due to strong fiber demand and the migration of customers from copper to fiber as we expand our fiber network. 32 The table below presents our revenue for our consumer and business and wholesale customers for the periods indicated: For the year ended For the year ended December 31, December 31, $ Increase % Increase ( $ in millions ) 2023 2022 (Decrease) (Decrease) Consumer $ 3,097 $ 3,116 $ (19) (1) % Business and wholesale 2,579 2,617 (38) (1) % Revenue from contracts with customers (1) 5,676 5,733 (57) (1) % Subsidy revenue 75 54 21 39 % Total revenue $ 5,751 $ 5,787 $ (36) (1) % (1) Includes $62 million and $63 million of lease revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We conduct business with a range of consumer, business, and wholesale customers, and we generate both recurring and non-recurring revenues. Recurring revenues are primarily billed at fixed recurring rates, with some services billed based on usage. Revenue recognition is not dependent upon significant judgments by management, with the exception of a determination of the provision for expected credit losses. Consumer For the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022: Consumer revenues were down approximately 1% for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The revenue growth was the result of growth in fiber data and value added service revenues along with inflationary price increases, offset by declines in voice, video, and copper broadband. o We experienced a 21% improvement in consumer fiber broadband revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. o This improvement is a result of higher consumer fiber broadband ARPU as well as increase net adds of consumer fiber broadband customers due to our expanded fiber footprint and continued focus on product positioning in both new and existing markets. We experienced a decline of approximately 12% in consumer copper broadband revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. As our copper footprint transitions to fiber, we expect fewer copper sales opportunities, and will proactively migrate certain existing broadband customers from copper to fiber, both of which will reduce our copper net adds. Business and Wholesale For the year ended December 31, 2023, our business and wholesale revenues decreased 1%, as compared to the prior year. This decline was driven by decreases in voice revenue predominantly in business, largely offset by increases in fiber broadband and network access services. The increase in fiber broadband was due to continued growth of our customer base, and a shift towards higher broadband speeds. The increase in network access services is due primarily to price adjustments as well as install and upgrade activity. The table below presents our revenue by product and service type for the periods indicated : For the year ended For the year ended December 31, December 31, $ Increase % Increase ( $ in millions ) 2023 2022 (Decrease) (Decrease) Data and Internet services $ 3,534 $ 3,390 $ 144 4 % Voice services 1,373 1,498 (125) (8) % Video services 430 520 (90) (17) % Other 339 325 14 4 % Revenue from contracts with customers (1) 5,676 5,733 (57) (1) % Subsidy revenue 75 54 21 39 % Total revenue $ 5,751 $ 5,787 $ (36) (1) % (1) Includes $62 million and $63 million of lease revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 33 We categorize our products, services, and other revenues into the following five categories: Data and Internet Services We provide data and Internet services to our consumer, business, and wholesale customers. Data and Internet services consist of fiber broadband services, copper broadband services, and network access revenues (data transmission services and dedicated high-capacity circuits including data services to wireless providers commonly called wireless backhaul). Network access services are provided primarily to our business and wholesale customers, while fiber and copper broadband are provided to all customer segments. Our fiber expansion strategy is expected to positively impact data and Internet services. This network expansion is designed to provide faster, symmetrical broadband speeds and provide customer and revenue growth opportunities for fiber broadband and certain network access products like ethernet. We believe this initiative will create opportunities for us to provide more fiber-based services to our customers. ($ in millions) Data and Internet services revenue, December 31, 2022 $ 3,390 Change in fiber broadband revenue 240 Change in copper broadband revenue (96) Data and Internet services revenue, December 31, 2023 $ 3,534 Data and internet services revenue increased $144 million, or 4%, to $3,534 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by growth in the fiber broadband revenue, partly offset by declines in copper broadband revenue. Voice services We provide voice services consisting of traditional local and long-distance service and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) service provided over our fiber and copper broadband products. It also includes enhanced features such as call waiting, caller identification, and voice messaging services. Voice services revenue declined $125 million, or 8%, to $1,373 million, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily due to net losses in business and consumer customers in addition to fewer customers bundling voice services with broadband as compared to the prior year period, all partially offset by higher voice services ARPU. Video services Video services include revenues generated from traditional television (TV) services provided directly to consumer customers as well as satellite TV services provided through various satellite providers . Video services also includes pay-per-view revenues, video on demand, equipment rentals, and video advertising. We have made the strategic decision to limit sales of new traditional TV services, focusing on our broadband products and OTT video options. We are partnering with OTT video providers and expect this to grow as OTT options are offered with our broadband products. Video services revenue declined $90 million, or 17%, to $430 million, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by linear video customer losses, partially offset by price increases as compared to the prior year. Other Other customer revenue includes non-recurring equipment sales, network facility rental income, ancillary customer fees, directory listing services and switched access revenue. Switched access revenue includes revenue derived from allowing other carriers to use our network to originate and/or terminate their local and long-distance voice traffic. These switched access services are primarily billed on a minutes-of-use basis applying tariffed rates filed with the FCC or state agencies. Other customer services revenue increased $14 million, or 4%, to $339 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year period driven by increases in pole rentals, related application fees and equipment sales, partially offset by decreases in switched network access revenue. Subsidy and other revenue Subsidy and other revenue increased $21 million, or 39%, to $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increases in RDOF, subsidies, and other revenue. ($ in millions) Subsidy and other revenue, December 31, 2022 $ 54 Change in CAF II and other subsidies 5 Change in RDOF and other revenue 16 Subsidy and other revenue, December 31, 2023 $ 75 34 OPERATING EXPENSES The table below presents our operating expenses for the periods indicated: For the year ended For the year ended ($ in millions) December 31, December 31, Variance 2023 2022 % Operating expenses: Cost of Service $ 2,125 $ 2,169 (2) % Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,646 1,745 (6) % Depreciation and amortization 1,415 1,182 20 % Restructuring costs and other charges 73 99 (26) % Total operating expenses $ 5,259 $ 5,195 1 % Cost of Service Cost of service expenses include access charges and other third-party costs directly attributable to connecting customer locations to our network and video content costs. Such access charges and other third-party costs exclude depreciation and amortization, and employee related expenses. Cost of service decreased $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year. The decrease in cost of service expense was driven by lower video content costs as a result of declines in video customers, non-renewal of certain content agreements, and decreased CPE costs. These decreases more than offset higher energy and benefits costs and outside service rate increases resulting from higher inflation. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses Selling, general, and administrative expenses ( SG&A expenses ) include the salaries, wages and related benefits and costs of corporate and sales personnel, travel, insurance, non-network related rent, advertising, and other administrative expenses. SG&A expenses decreased by $99 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily a result of lower compensation and benefit costs, and other fees, partially offset by increased commissions and an $11 million sales tax refund in 2022. Pension and Other post-employment benefits ( OPEB ) costs We allocate certain pension/OPEB expense to cost of service and SG&A expenses. Total pension and OPEB service costs were as follows : For the year ended For the year ended December 31, December 31, ($ in millions) 2023 2022 Total pension/OPEB expenses $ 59 $ 82 Less: costs capitalized into capital expenditures (18) (21) Net pension/OPEB expense $ 41 $ 61 Depreciation and Amortization For the year ended December 31, 2023, the increased depreciation and amortization expense was driven by higher depreciation expense as a result of higher property, plant and equipment in service. Restructuring costs and other charges Restructuring costs and other charges consist of consulting and advisory fees, workforce reductions, transformation initiatives, and other restructuring expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2023, restructuring costs and other charges decreased $26 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the non-recurrence of a one-time lease impairment charge of $44 million in the prior year, and lower costs related to other restructuring activities, partially offset by higher severance and employee costs. 35 OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSE For the year ended For the year ended ( $ in millions ) December 31, December 31, % Increase 2023 2022 (Decrease) Investment and other income, net $ 278 $ 554 (50)% Pension settlement costs $ - $ (55) NM Interest expense $ (653) $ (492) 33% % Income tax expense $ 88 $ 158 (44)% NM - Not meaningful Investment and other income, net Investment and other income, net decreased by $276 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by a remeasurement gain for our pension benefit obligation of $202 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a remeasurement gain for our other postretirement benefit obligation of $248 million, and a remeasurement gain related to our pension plan of $218 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Interest expense For the year ended December 31, 2023, interest expense increased $161 million, as compared to 2022. The increase in interest expense was primarily driven by a higher debt balance, as well as higher interest rates. Pension settlement During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not incur any lump sum pension settlement payments to terminated or retired individuals as we did not exceed the settlement threshold of $180 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, lump sum pension settlement payments to terminated or retired individuals amounted to $200 million, which exceeded the settlement threshold of $175 million, and as a result, we recognized non-cash settlement charges totaling $55 million for 2022. Income tax expense (benefit) During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded an income tax expense of $88 million on pre-tax income of $117 million. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 75.3 %. (b) Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2023, we had liquidity of approximately $3,242 million, comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $1,125 million, $1,075 million of short-term investments (consisting of term deposits earning interest in excess of traditional bank deposit rates, and placed with banks with A-1/P-1 or equivalent credit quality), $500 million Variable Funding Notes capacity, subject to customary conditions to draw, and available capacity on our undrawn revolving credit facility of $542 million. Analysis of Cash Flows As of December 31, 2023, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents aggregating $1,125 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we used cash flow from operations, cash on hand, and cash from borrowings principally to fund our cash investing and financing activities, which were primarily short-term investments and capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2023, we had a working capital surplus of $506 million compared to a $302 million surplus at December 31, 2022. The primary driver for the change in the working capital surplus at December 31, 2023 was due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $803 million and a decrease in accounts payable of $307 million; partially offset by a decrease in short-term investments of $675 million and an increase in vendor financing payables of $263 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. In August 2023, our limited-purpose, bankruptcy remote, subsidiary, Frontier Issuer LLC ( Frontier Issuer ), issued $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of secured fiber network revenue term notes, less $58 million in original issue discounts, consisting of $1,120 million 6.60% Series 2023-1, Class A-2 term notes, $155 million 8.30% Series 2023-1, Class B term notes and $312 million 11.50% Series 2023-1, Class C term notes (collectively, the Fiber Term Notes ), each with an anticipated repayment date ( ARD ), in July 2028, in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act. The Fiber Term Notes are secured by certain of Frontier fiber assets and associated customer contracts in the Dallas, Texas metropolitan area. Certain cash and other accounts for the benefit of the Trustee and noteholders are restricted. We intend to use the proceeds from the offering of the Fiber Term Notes for, among other things, general corporate purposes, including potential investments or expenditures, such as capital expenditures and research and development, in line with our fiber expansion and copper migration strategies. In addition, we used a portion of the proceeds to retire and defease certain outstanding indebtedness of our subsidiary Frontier Southwest Incorporated. In connection with the offering of Fiber Term Notes, Frontier Issuer entered into a financing facility for the issuance of up to $500 million in Series 2023-2 Secured Fiber Network Revenue Variable Funding Senior Notes, Class A-1 (the Variable Funding Notes ) with a delayed draw feature, subject to leverage tests and other customary drawing conditions. 36 Cash Flows provided from Operating Activities Cash flows provided from operating activities decreased $57 million to $1,344 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022. The overall decrease in operating cash flows was primarily the result of changes in working capital. We paid less than $1 million in net cash taxes during the year ended December 31, 2023, and we paid $8 million in net cash taxes during the year ended December 31, 2022. Cash Flows used by Investing Activities Cash flows used by investing activities were $2,556 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to cash flows used by investing activities of $4,468 million in 2022. Given the long-term nature of our fiber build, as of December 31, 2023, we have invested $1,075 million cash in short-term investments to improve interest income, while preserving funding flexibility. Capital Expenditures For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our capital expenditures were $3,211 million and $2,738 million, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures was driven by increased spending for transformation of our fiber network. We expect cash capital expenditures and capital vendor financing payments to total approximately $3.0 billion to $3.2 billion in 2024. Cash Flows provided from Financing Activities Cash flows provided from financing activities increased $918 million to $2,129 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in financing activities was primarily driven by an increase in proceeds from long-term debt borrowings in the first three quarters of 2023 as compared to the prior year period. Capital Resources Our primary anticipated uses of liquidity are to fund the costs of operations, working capital and capital expenditures and to fund interest payments on our long-term debt. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash on hand and borrowing capacity under our $900 million Revolving Facility (as reduced by $358 million of revolver Letters of Credit). In addition, potential future sources of capital may include debt and equity (or equity-linked) financing and the $500 million Variable Funding Notes facility. See Analysis of Cash Flows above for a description of Frontier Issuer August 2023 issuance of Fiber Term Notes and entry into a $500 million Variable Funding Notes facility. As of December 31, 2023, we extinguished $53 million of subsidiary notes and transferred assets to an escrow account to pay the future interest and principal on the remaining $47 million of notes, which remain on our balance sheet as outstanding debt and restricted assets. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we paid $711 million of cash interest. Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including our $1.4 billion Term Loan Facility and $900 million Revolving Facility, the indentures governing our outstanding secured First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes, and the indentures governing our Fiber Term Notes and Variable Funding Notes are described in detail in Note 9 to the financial statements contained in Part I of this report. A summary of certain covenants and our borrowing capacity is provided below. We have negotiated payment terms with certain of our vendors (referred to as vendor financing), which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. As of December 31, 2023, we had $263 million of vendor financing liabilities included in Other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets , of which $255 million is associated with capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2023 we have made $5 million in vendor financing payments, of which $4 million is related to capital expenditures and $1 million is related to operating expenses. We have assessed our current and expected funding requirements and our current and expected sources of liquidity, and have determined, based on our forecasted financial results and financial condition as of December 31, 2023, that our operating cash flows and existing cash balances, will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, make required debt interest and principal payments, pay taxes and make other payments over the next twelve months. A number of factors, including but not limited to, loss of customers, pricing pressure from increased competition, lower subsidy and switched access revenues, and the impact of economic conditions, may negatively affect our cash generated from operations. Debt Covenants and Borrowing Capacity Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes usual and customary negative covenants for loan agreements of this type, including covenants limiting us and our restricted subsidiaries (other than certain covenants therein which are limited to subsidiary guarantors) ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions, pay dividends and distributions and make payments in respect of certain material subordinated indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions for loan agreements of this type. 37 Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains a financial covenant which provides that our first lien leverage ratio shall not exceed as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 3.50:1.00, with step-downs to: (a) 3.25:1.00 in 2026; and (b) 3.00:1.00 in 2027 and continuing thereafter. This financial covenant is only applicable for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) thereunder and failure to comply with the financial covenant would not cause an Event of Default with respect to any loans pursuant to our term loan facility unless and until the Required Revolving Lenders (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) have declared all amounts outstanding under the revolving facility to be immediately due and payable and all outstanding commitments under the revolving facility to be immediately terminated. The indentures governing our First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes also include usual and customary negative covenants for debt securities of this type, including covenants limiting us and our restricted subsidiaries (other than certain covenants therein which are limited to subsidiary guarantors) ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions, pay dividends and distributions and make payments in respect of certain material subordinated indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions for debt securities of this type. The indentures governing the outstanding subsidiary debentures include covenants that limit such subsidiary ability to create liens and/or merge or consolidate with other companies. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. The indenture governing Frontier Issuer Fiber Term Notes includes covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type. These covenants and restrictions include the maintenance of a liquidity reserve account to be used to make required payments in respect of the Fiber Term Notes, provisions relating to prepayments, required indemnification payments in certain circumstances. The Fiber Term Notes are also subject to rapid amortization in the event of a failure to maintain a stated debt service coverage ratio. A rapid amortization may be cured if the debt service coverage ratio exceeds a certain threshold for a certain period of time, upon which cure, regular amortization, if any, will resume. The Fiber Term Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the Fiber Term Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective and certain judgments. The Fiber Term Notes are subject to covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Fiber Term Notes and pay certain reserved fixed costs of the fiber networks, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments of the Fiber Term Notes and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of prepayments of the Fiber Term Notes under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Fiber Term Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective, and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. In addition, the terms of the indenture governing the Fiber Term Notes provide that a larger portion of Frontier Issuer available funds will be used towards the repayment of the Fiber Term Notes during a cash sweep period, which period would result from, among other things, the failure to maintain a certain debt service coverage ratio or a certain minimum penetration rate in the markets that were securitized at closing. The Fiber Term Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the acceleration of the maturity of the Fiber Term Notes following the occurrence of an event of default and the failure to repay or refinance on the applicable anticipated repayment date. The customary events of default to which the Fiber Term Notes are subject include events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the Fiber Term Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective and certain judgments. In addition, the Indenture and the related management agreement contain various covenants that limit the ability of the Company securitized subsidiaries to engage in specified types of transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including, for example, to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, sell certain assets, create or incur liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets. As of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our existing indentures and the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Net Operating Losses In connection with our emergence from bankruptcy, we consummated a taxable disposition of substantially all of the assets and/or subsidiary stock of the Company. Certain of the net operating losses ( NOLs ) were utilized in offsetting gains from the disposition, certain of the NOLs were extinguished as part of attribute reduction and certain subsidiary NOLs were carried over. Under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, Predecessor and Successor made elections to step-up tax basis of certain subsidiary assets. Such Section 338(h)(10) elections will generate depreciation and amortization expense going forward, which may result in NOLs. Such net operating losses would be carried forward indefinitely but would be subject to an 80% limitation on U.S. taxable income. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial statements. 38 Future Contractual Obligations and Commitments A summary of our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2023 is as follows: Payments due by period ($ in millions) Total 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Long-term debt obligations, excluding interest $ 11,231 $ 15 $ 15 $ 15 $ 2,740 $ 3,636 $ 4,810 Interest on long-term debt 3,990 813 794 786 753 357 487 Lease obligations 478 75 69 64 54 45 171 Purchase obligations 332 204 125 2 1 - - Total $ 16,031 $ 1,107 $ 1,003 $ 867 $ 3,548 $ 4,038 $ 5,468 Our outstanding performance letters of credit increased from $174 million to $181 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. Future Commitments See Regulatory Developments immediately below for information regarding Frontier known and potential future commitments related to our participation in the FCC CAF Phase II program and RDOF Phase I auction. Regulatory Developments Connect America Fund ( CAF )/ Rural Digital Opportunity Fund ( RDOF ): In 2015, Frontier accepted the FCC CAF Phase II offer, which provided $313 million in annual support through 2021 in return for the Company commitment to make broadband available to households within the CAF II areas in our existing 25 states. The Company was required to complete the CAF II deployment by December 31, 2021. Thereafter, the FCC has been reviewing carriers CAF II program completion data, and if the FCC determines that the Company did not satisfy certain applicable CAF Phase II requirements, Frontier could be required to return a portion of the funds previously received and may be subject to certain other fines, requirements, and obligations. On January 30, 2020, the FCC adopted an order establishing the RDOF competitive reverse auction to provide support to serve high-cost areas. The FCC announced the results of its RDOF Phase I auction on December 7, 2020. Frontier was awarded approximately $371 million over ten years to build gigabit-capable broadband over a fiber-to-the-premises network to approximately 127,000 locations in eight states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia). We began receiving RDOF funding in the second quarter of 2022 and we will be required to complete the buildout to the awarded locations by December 31, 2028, with interim target milestones over this period. To the extent that Frontier is unable to meet the milestones or construct to all locations by the required deadlines, Frontier could be required to return a portion of funds previously received and may be subject to certain fines, requirements and obligations. As part of its RDOF order, the FCC indicated it would hold a follow-on auction for the unawarded funding following the Phase I auction. However, it remains uncertain whether any such follow-on auction will occur given the recent passage of significant federal funding for broadband infrastructure. Internet: The FCC currently classifies fixed consumer broadband services as information services, subject to light-touch regulation. In October 2023 the FCC released a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking to reclassify certain broadband services as lightly regulated telecommunications services imposing certain network neutrality requirements on the reclassified internet services. At this time, it remains uncertain whether the FCC will adopt these new network neutrality regulations and what impact that may have on Frontier business. On November 15, 2021, President Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) into law. The legislation appropriated funding for the establishment of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), and FCC-administered monthly, low-income broadband benefit program. The ACP provides qualified customers up to $30 per month (or $75 per month for those on Tribal lands) to assist with their internet bill. Frontier is a participating provider in the ACP program. Absent additional funding, at present pace, the ACP funds are projected by the FCC to exhaust in April of 2024. Privacy: Our businesses are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the handling of customers personal information. Privacy-related legislation has been adopted in a number of states in which we operate. Certain state requirements give consumers increased rights including the right to know what personal information is being collected about them and obtain a copy of such information, opt-out of the sale of personal information or sharing of personal information for purposes of certain targeted advertising, and to request the correction or deletion of this information. Complying with such laws, as well as other legislative and regulatory action related to privacy, could result in increased costs of compliance, claims against the Company or investigations related to compliance, and increased uncertainty in the use and availability of certain consumer data. Video Programming: Federal, state, and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry. Our linear video services are subject to, among other things: subscriber privacy regulations; requirements that we carry a local broadcast station or obtain 39 consent to carry a local or distant broadcast station; rules for franchise renewals and transfers; the manner in which program packages are marketed to subscribers; and program access requirements. We provide video programming in some of our markets including California, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, and Texas pursuant to franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by state and local franchising authorities. Most franchises require payment of a franchise fee as a requirement to the granting of authority. Many franchises establish facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. We believe that we are meeting all material standards and requirements. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. Environmental Regulation: The local exchange carrier subsidiaries we operate are subject to federal, state, and local laws, and regulations governing the use, storage, disposal of, and exposure to hazardous materials, the release of pollutants into the environment and the remediation of contamination. As an owner and former owner of property, we are subject to environmental laws that could impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup at contaminated sites, including sites formerly owned by us or our predecessors, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the activity that resulted in contamination. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. There are inherent uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions; accordingly, it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term. The estimates which require the most significant judgment are listed below. These critical accounting estimates have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For a discussion of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Fresh Start Accounting We adopted fresh start accounting and reporting on the Effective Date, in accordance with FASB ASC 852. Upon the application of fresh start accounting, we allocated the reorganization value to our individual assets based on their estimated fair values. Each asset and liability existing as of the Effective Date, other than deferred taxes, have been stated at the fair value, and determined at appropriate risk-adjusted interest rates. Deferred taxes were determined in conformity with applicable accounting standards. Reorganization value represents the fair value of the Successor assets before considering liabilities. Our reorganization value is derived from an estimate of enterprise value. Enterprise value represents the estimated fair value of an entity long-term debt and shareholders equity. In support of the Plan, the enterprise value of the Successor was estimated to be approximately $12.5 billion. The valuation analysis was prepared using financial information and financial projections and applying standard valuation techniques, including a risked net asset value analysis. Fair values of assets and liabilities represent our best estimates based on independent appraisals and valuations. These estimates and assumptions were subject to significant uncertainties beyond our reasonable control. In addition, the market value of our common stock may differ materially from the fresh start equity valuation. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of our ability to collect accounts receivable. Our estimates are based on assumptions and other considerations, including payment history, customer financial performance, carrier billing disputes and aging analysis. Our estimation process includes general and specific reserves and varies by customer category. In 2023 and 2022, we had no critical estimates related to bankruptcies of communications companies or any other significant customers. See Notes 1 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Depreciation The calculation of depreciation expense is based upon the estimated useful lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment. Depreciation expense is principally based on the composite group method for substantially all of our property, plant, and equipment assets. The estimates for remaining lives of the various asset categories are determined annually, based on an independent study. Among other considerations, these studies include models that consider actual usage, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution for each category of asset. The latest study was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 and did not result in any significant changes in remaining lives for any of our asset categories. A one-year decrease in the estimated useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment would result in an increase of approximately $128 million to depreciation expense. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 40 Asset Impairments We review long-lived assets to be held and used, including customer lists, finite-lived intangible assets, and long-lived assets to be disposed of for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. When triggering events are identified, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair market value. If any assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value. Also, we periodically reassess the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets to determine whether any changes are required. We considered whether the carrying values of finite-lived intangible assets, and property plant and equipment may not be recoverable or whether the carrying value of certain finite-lived intangible assets were impaired, noting no impairment was present as of or for the year ended December 31, 2023. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan covering a significant number of our current and former employees as well as other postretirement benefit plans that provide medical, dental, life insurance and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents. As of December 31, 2023, the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was $735 million. During 2023, we contributed $176 million to these plans in cash and recorded $59 million of operating expense before capitalization, and $209 million of net non-operating income. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our actuaries based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long-term, high quality corporate bonds with durations approximate to that of our benefit obligation. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, we utilized an estimation technique that is based upon a settlement model (Bond:Link) that permits us to closely match cash flows to the expected payments to participants. This rate can change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. We are utilizing a discount rate of 5.20% as of December 31, 2023, for our qualified pension plan, compared to rates of 5.50% and 2.90% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The discount rate for postretirement plans as of December 31, 2023, was 5.20% compared to 5.50% in 2022 and 3.00% in 2021. In the following table, we show the estimated sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2023: ($ in millions) Increase in Discount Rate of 25 bps Decrease in Discount Rate of 25 bps Pension plans Projected benefit obligation $ (48) $ 50 Other postretirement plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation $ (13) $ 13 In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we considered published surveys of expected market returns, 10 and 20 year actual returns of various major indices, and our own historical 5-year, 10-year and 20-year investment returns. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 35% in long-duration fixed income securities, and 65% in equity securities and other investments. We review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate. Our asset return assumption is made at the beginning of our fiscal year. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 7.50%. Our actual return on plan assets for the year ended December 31, 2023, was a gain of 15%, for the year ended December 31, 2022, was a loss of 20%, for the four months ended April 30, 2021, was a gain of 3%, and for the eight months ended December 31, 2021, was a gain of 6%. For 2024, we expect to assume a rate of return of 7.50%. Our pension plan assets are valued at fair value as of the measurement date . For additional information regarding our pension and other postretirement benefits (see Note 19 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Income Taxes We file a consolidated federal income tax return. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recorded for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in governing law or review by taxing authorities. 41 We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine that we are not able to realize a portion of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would increase the provision for income taxes. The tax effect of a change in tax law or rates included in income tax expense from continuing operations includes effect of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities initially recognized through a charge or credit to other comprehensive income. The residual tax effects typically are released when the item giving rise to the tax effect is disposed of, liquidated, or terminated.
