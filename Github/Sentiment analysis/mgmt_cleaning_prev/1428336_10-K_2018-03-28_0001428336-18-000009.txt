Item 7. Management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those discussed in the section titled Risk factors included under Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this report. See Special note regarding forward-looking statements. Overview We are a leader and an innovator in the high-growth category of technology-enabled services platforms that empower consumers to make healthcare saving and spending decisions. Our platform provides an ecosystem where consumers can access their tax-advantaged healthcare savings, compare treatment options and pricing, evaluate and pay healthcare bills, receive personalized benefit and clinical information, earn wellness incentives, and make educated investment choices to grow their tax-advantaged healthcare savings. The core of our ecosystem is the HSA, a financial account through which consumers spend and save long-term for healthcare on a tax-advantaged basis. We are the integrated HSA platform for 124 Health Plan and Administrator Partners and over 40,000 employer clients. Since our inception in 2002, we have been committed to developing technology solutions that empower healthcare consumers. In 2003, we began offering live 24/7/365 consumer support from health saving and spending experts. In 2005, we integrated HSAs with our first health plan partner, and in 2006, we were authorized to act as an HSA custodian by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In 2009, we integrated HSAs with multiple health plans of a single large employer, began delivering integrated wellness incentives through an HSA, and partnered with a private health insurance exchange as its preferred HSA partner. In 2011, we integrated HSAs, RAs, and investment accounts on one website, and in 2013, our registered investment advisor subsidiary began delivering HSA-specific investment advice online. In 2015, we launched our HSA Optimizer, which helps HSA members optimize their accounts based on their individual preferences and goals. In 2016, we launched a new feature which provides account holders advance access to funds. We earn revenue primarily from three sources: service revenue, custodial revenue and interchange revenue. We earn service revenue by providing monthly account services on our platform, primarily through contracts with our Network Partners, and custodial agreements with individual members. We earn custodial revenue from custodial cash assets deposited with our FDIC-insured custodial depository bank partners and with our insurance company partner, and recordkeeping fees we earn in respect of mutual funds in which our members invest. We also earn interchange revenue from interchange fees that we earn on payments that our members make using our physical and virtual payment cards. Key factors affecting our performance We believe that our performance and future success are driven by a number of factors, including those identified below. Each of these factors presents both significant opportunities and significant risks to our future performance. See the section entitled Risk factors included in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Structural change in U.S. private health insurance Substantially all of our revenue is derived from healthcare-related saving and spending by consumers in the United States, which is impacted by changes affecting the broader healthcare industry in the U.S. The healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years, and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur that will result in increased participation in HDHPs and other consumer-centric health plans. In particular, we believe that continued growth in healthcare costs, and related factors will spur HDHP and HSA growth; however, the timing and impact of these and other developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict, and changes in U.S. healthcare policy could adversely affect our business. - 29 - Table of Contents Attracting and penetrating network partners We created our business model to take advantage of the changing dynamics of the U.S. private health insurance market. Our model is based on a B2B2C distribution strategy, meaning that we rely on our Employer Partners and Health Plan and Administrator Partners to reach potential members to increase the number of our HSA Members. Our success depends in large part on our ability to further penetrate our existing Network Partners by adding new HSA Members from these partners and adding new Network Partners. Our innovative technology platform We believe that innovations incorporated in our technology that enable consumers to make healthcare saving and spending decisions differentiate us from our competitors and drive our growth in revenue, HSA Members, Network Partners and custodial assets. Similarly, these innovations underpin our ability to provide a differentiated consumer experience in a cost-effective manner. For example, we are currently undertaking a significant update of our proprietary platform architecture, which will allow us to improve our transaction processing capabilities and related platform infrastructure to support continued account and transaction growth. We intend to continue to invest in our technology development to enhance our platform capabilities and infrastructure. Our DEEP Purple culture The new healthcare consumer needs education and guidance delivered by people as well as technology. We believe that our "DEEP Purple" culture which we define as driving excellence, ethics, and process while providing remarkable service, is a significant factor in our ability to attract and retain customers and to address nimbly opportunities in the rapidly changing healthcare sector. We make significant efforts to promote and foster DEEP Purple within our workforce. We invest in and intend to continue to invest in human capital through technology-enabled training, career development and advancement opportunities. Interest rates As a non-bank custodian, we contract with FDIC-insured custodial depository bank partners and an insurance company partner to hold custodial cash assets on behalf of our members, and we earn a significant portion of our total revenue from interest rates offered to us by these partners. The contract terms range from three to five years and have either fixed or variable interest rates. As our custodial assets increase and existing agreements expire, we seek to enter into new contracts with FDIC-insured custodial depository bank partners, the terms of which are impacted by the then-prevailing interest rate environment. The diversification of deposits among bank partners and varied contract terms substantially reduces our exposure to short-term fluctuations in prevailing interest rates and mitigates the short-term impact of a sustained increase or decline in prevailing interest rates on our custodial revenue. A sustained decline in prevailing interest rates may negatively affect our business by reducing the size of the interest rate yield, or yield, available to us and thus the amount of the custodial revenue we can realize. Conversely, a sustained increase in prevailing interest rates can increase our yield over time. An increase in our yield would increase our custodial revenue as a percentage of total revenue. In addition, as our yield increases, we expect the spread to grow between the interest offered to us by our custodial depository bank partners and the interest retained by our members, thus increasing our profitability. However, we may be required to increase the interest retained by our members in a rising prevailing interest rate environment. Changes in prevailing interest rates are driven by macroeconomic trends and government policies over which we have no control. Our competition and industry Our direct competitors are HSA custodians. Many of these are state or federally chartered banks and other financial institutions for which we believe technology-based healthcare services are not a core business. Certain of our direct competitors have chosen to exit the market despite increased demand for these services. This has created, and we believe will continue to create, opportunities for us to leverage our technology platform and capabilities to increase our market share. However, some of our direct competitors are in a position, should they choose, to devote more resources to the development, sale and support of their products and services than we have at our disposal. In addition, numerous indirect competitors, including benefits administration technology and service providers, partner with banks and other HSA custodians to compete with us. Our Health Plan and Administrator Partners may also choose to offer technology-based healthcare services directly, as some health plans have done. Our success depends on our ability to predict and react quickly to these and other industry and competitive dynamics. Regulatory environment Federal law and regulations, including the Affordable Care Act, the Internal Revenue Code and IRS regulations, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and Department of Labor regulations, and public health regulations that govern the provision of health insurance, play a pivotal role in determining our market opportunity. Privacy and data - 30 - Table of Contents security-related laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, laws governing the provision of investment advice to consumers, such as the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or the Advisers Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, anti-money laundry laws, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, all play a similar role in determining our competitive landscape. In addition, state-level regulations also have significant implications for our business in some cases. For example, our subsidiary HealthEquity Trust Company is regulated by the Wyoming Division of Banking, and several states are considering, or have already passed, new fiduciary rules that can affect our business. Our ability to predict and react quickly to relevant legal and regulatory trends and to correctly interpret their market and competitive implications is important to our success. Our acquisition strategy We have a successful history of acquiring complementary assets and businesses that strengthen our platform. We seek to continue this growth strategy and are regularly engaged in evaluating different opportunities. We have developed an internal capability to source, evaluate and integrate acquisitions that have created value for shareholders. We believe the nature of our competitive landscape provides a significant acquisition opportunity. Many of our competitors view their HSA businesses as non-core functions. We believe more of them will look to divest these assets and, in certain cases, be limited from making acquisitions due to depository capital requirements. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary assets and businesses that we believe will strengthen our platform. Key financial and operating metrics Our management regularly reviews a number of key operating and financial metrics to evaluate our business, determine the allocation of our resources, make decisions regarding corporate strategies and evaluate forward-looking projections and trends affecting our business. We discuss certain of these key financial metrics, including revenue, below in the section entitled Key components of our results of operations. In addition, we utilize other key metrics as described below. HSA Members The following table sets forth our HSA Members for the periods indicated: % change from % change from January 31, 2018 January 31, 2017 January 31, 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017 HSA Members 3,402,889 2,746,132 2,140,631 24 % 28 % Average HSA Members - Year-to-date 2,951,790 2,339,091 1,600,327 26 % 46 % Average HSA Members - Quarter-to-date 3,188,927 2,519,382 1,850,843 27 % 36 % HSA Members with investments 121,614 65,906 44,680 85 % 48 % HSA Members is critical because our service revenue is driven by the amount we charge per HSA Member. The number of our HSA Members increased by approximately 657,000, or 24%, from January 31, 2017 to January 31, 2018 , and by approximately 606,000, or 28%, from January 31, 2016 to January 31, 2017 . The increase in the number of our HSA Members in these periods was primarily driven by the addition of new Network Partners and further penetration into existing Network Partners. In addition, during the year ended January 31, 2018 , we acquired the rights to be custodian of First Interstate Bancsystem and Alliant Credit Union portfolios consisting of approximately 14,000 and 40,000 HSA Members, respectively. During the year ended January 31, 2016, we acquired the rights to be the custodian of the Bancorp Bank and M&T Bank HSA portfolios consisting of approximately 160,000 and 35,000 HSA Members, respectively, the latter of which transitioned to our platform during the year ended January 31, 2017 . - 31 - Table of Contents Custodial assets The following table sets forth our custodial assets for the periods indicated: % change from % change from (in thousands, except percentages) January 31, 2018 January 31, 2017 January 31, 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017 Custodial cash $ 5,489,617 $ 4,380,487 $ 3,278,628 25 % 34 % Custodial investments 1,288,693 658,580 405,878 96 % 62 % Total custodial assets $ 6,778,310 $ 5,039,067 $ 3,684,506 35 % 37 % Average daily custodial cash - Year-to-date $ 4,571,341 $ 3,661,058 $ 2,326,506 25 % 57 % Average daily custodial cash - Quarter-to-date $ 4,876,438 $ 3,854,518 $ 2,682,827 27 % 44 % Our custodial assets, which are our HSA Members' assets for which we are the custodian, consist of the following components: (1) custodial cash deposits, which are deposits with our FDIC-insured custodial depository bank partners, (2) custodial cash deposits invested in an annuity contract with our insurance company partner and (3) members' investments in mutual funds through our custodial investment fund partner. Measuring our custodial assets is important because our custodial revenue is directly affected by average daily custodial balances. Our total custodial assets increased by $1.7 billion, or 35%, from January 31, 2017 to January 31, 2018 . Our total custodial assets increased by $1.4 billion, or 37%, from January 31, 2016 to January 31, 2017 . The increase in total custodial assets in these periods was driven by additional custodial assets from our existing HSA Members and new custodial assets from new HSA Members added during the fiscal year. In addition, during the year ended January 31, 2018 , we acquired the rights to be custodian of First Interstate Bancsystem and Alliant Credit Union portfolios consisting of approximately $55.0 million and $109.0 million of custodial assets, respectively. During the year ended January 31, 2016, we acquired the rights to be the custodian of the Bancorp Bank and M&T Bank HSA portfolios consisting of approximately $390.0 million and $63.0 million of custodial assets, respectively, the latter of which transitioned to our platform during the year ended January 31, 2017 . Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial metric, as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and certain other non-cash statement of operations items. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and analysts in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and our board of directors because it reflects operating profitability before consideration of non-operating expenses and non-cash expenses, and serves as a basis for comparison against other companies in our industry. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated: Year ended January 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 Net income $ 47,362 $ 26,376 $ 16,613 Interest income (734 ) (531 ) (414 ) Interest expense 274 275 91 Income tax provision 4,827 13,744 8,941 Depreciation and amortization 11,089 8,889 6,393 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 4,863 4,297 2,208 Stock-based compensation expense 14,310 8,398 5,883 Other (1) 2,689 1,348 910 Adjusted EBITDA $ 84,680 $ 62,796 $ 40,625 (1) For the years ended January 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , Other consisted of non-income based taxes of $439, $358 and $334, acquisition-related costs of $2,197, $631 and $471, and other costs of $53, $359 and $105, respectively. The following table sets forth our Adjusted EBITDA: Year ended January 31, % change from % change from (in thousands, except percentages) 2018 2017 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017 Adjusted EBITDA $ 84,680 $ 62,796 $ 40,625 35 % 55 % As a percentage of revenue 37 % 35 % 32 % - 32 - Table of Contents Our Adjusted EBITDA increased by $21.9 million, or 35%, from $62.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2017 to $84.7 million for the year ended January 31, 2018 . The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by the overall growth of our business, including a $13.2 million, or 32%, increase in income from operations. Our Adjusted EBITDA increased by $22.2 million, or 55%, from $40.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2016 to $62.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2017 . The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by the overall growth of our business, including a $15.1 million, or 58%, increase in income from operations. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Key components of our results of operations Revenue The following table sets forth our revenue for the periods indicated: Year ended January 31, % change from % change from (in thousands, except percentages) 2018 2017 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017 Service revenue $ 91,619 $ 77,254 $ 61,608 19 % 25 % Custodial revenue 87,160 59,593 37,755 46 % 58 % Interchange revenue 50,746 41,523 27,423 22 % 51 % Total revenue $ 229,525 $ 178,370 $ 126,786 29 % 41 % We earn revenue from three primary sources: service revenue, custodial revenue and interchange revenue. Service revenue. We earn service revenue from the fees we charge our Network Partners, employer clients and individual members for the administration services we provide in connection with the HSAs and RAs we offer. With respect to our Network Partners, our fees are generally based on a fixed tiered structure for the duration of our agreement with the relevant Network Partner and are paid to us on a monthly basis. We recognize revenue on a monthly basis as services are rendered under our written service agreements. Custodial revenue. We earn custodial revenue from our custodial cash assets deposited with our FDIC-insured custodial depository bank partners and with our insurance company partner, and recordkeeping fees we earn in respect of mutual funds in which our members invest. As a non-bank custodian, we deposit our custodial cash with our various bank partners pursuant to contracts that (i) have terms up to five years, (ii) provide for a fixed or variable interest rate payable on the average daily cash balances deposited with the relevant bank partner, and (iii) have minimum and maximum required deposit balances. We earn custodial revenue on our custodial cash that is based on the interest rates offered to us by these bank partners. In addition, once a member HSA cash balance reaches a certain threshold, the member is able to invest his or her HSA assets in mutual funds through our custodial investment partner. We receive a recordkeeping fee related to such custodial investments. Interchange revenue. We earn interchange revenue each time one of our members uses one of our payment cards to make a qualified purchase. This revenue is collected each time a member swipes our payment card to pay a healthcare-related expense. We recognize interchange revenue monthly based on reports received from third parties, namely, the card-issuing bank and the card processor. Cost of revenue Cost of revenue includes costs related to servicing member accounts, managing customer and partner relationships and processing reimbursement claims. Expenditures include personnel-related costs, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, common expense allocations (such as office rent, supplies, and other overhead expenses), new member and participant supplies, and other operating costs related to servicing our members. Other components of cost of revenue include interest retained by members on custodial cash and interchange costs incurred in connection with processing card transactions for our members. Service costs. Service costs include the servicing costs described above. Additionally, for new accounts, we incur on-boarding costs associated with the new accounts, such as new member welcome kits, the cost associated with issuance of new payment cards and costs of marketing materials that we produce for our Network Partners. Custodial costs. Custodial costs are comprised of interest retained by our HSA Members and fees we pay to banking consultants whom we use to help secure agreements with our FDIC-insured custodial depository banking partners. Interest retained by HSA Members is calculated on a tiered basis. The interest rates retained by HSA Members can change based on a formula or upon required notice. - 33 - Table of Contents Interchange costs. Interchange costs are comprised of costs we incur in connection with processing payment transactions initiated by our members. Due to the substantiation requirement on RA-linked payment card transactions, which is the requirement that we confirm each purchase involves a qualified medical expense as defined under applicable law, payment card costs are higher for RA card transactions. In addition to fixed per card fees, we are assessed additional transaction costs determined by the amount of the transaction. Gross profit and gross margin Our gross profit is our total revenue minus our total cost of revenue, and our gross margin is our gross profit expressed as a percentage of our total revenue. Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a number of factors, including the amount we charge our partners and members, interest rates, how many services we deliver per account, and payment processing costs per account. We expect our annual gross margin to remain relatively steady over the near term, although our gross margin could fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these factors. Operating expenses Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, including sales commissions for our direct sales force, external agent/broker commission expenses, marketing expenses, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and common expense allocations. Technology and development. Technology and development expenses include personnel and related expenses for software engineering, information technology, and product development. Technology and development expenses also include software engineering services, the costs of operating our on-demand technology infrastructure, depreciation, amortization of capitalized software development costs, stock-based compensation, and common expense allocations. General and administrative. General and administrative expenses include personnel and related expenses of, and professional fees incurred by our executive, finance, legal, compliance, and people departments. They also include depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and common expense allocations. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets results primarily from our acquisition of intangible member assets. We acquired these intangible member assets from third-party custodians. We amortize these assets over the assets estimated useful life of 15 years. We also acquired other intangible assets, which are 401(k) customer relationships, in connection with an acquisition of a business. We amortize these assets over the assets' estimated useful life of 10 years. We evaluate our acquired intangible assets for impairment at least each year, or at a triggering event. Other expense, net Other expense primarily consists of interest expense associated with our credit facility, miscellaneous taxes, and acquisition-related expenses. Income tax provision We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States based on a calendar tax year which differs from our fiscal year-end for financial reporting purposes. We use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes, under which current tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on the tax returns for the current fiscal year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, net operating loss carryforwards, and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. As of January 31, 2018 , we recorded a net non-current deferred tax asset. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Due to the positive evidence of historical profits coupled with forecasted profitability, no valuation allowance was required as of January 31, 2018 . - 34 - Table of Contents Results of operations Service revenue The $14.4 million, or 19%, increase in service revenue from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the number of our HSA Members, partially offset by the lower service revenue per HSA Member described below. The $15.6 million, or 25%, increase in service revenue from the year ended January 31, 2016 to the year ended January 31, 2017 was also primarily due to an increase in the number of our HSA Members. The number of our HSA Members increased by approximately 657,000, or 24%, from January 31, 2017 to January 31, 2018 , and by approximately 606,000, or 28%, from January 31, 2016 to January 31, 2017 . Service revenue per HSA Member decreased by approximately 6% from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 , and 14% from the year ended January 31, 2016 to the year ended January 31, 2017 . Our service revenue tier structure incentivizes Network Partners to add HSA Members by charging a lower rate as additional HSA Members are added. Accordingly, as Network Partners add more HSA Members, the service revenue per HSA Member will continue to decrease. Additionally, as RAs grow less rapidly than HSAs, service revenue per HSA Member will decrease. The decrease in service revenue per HSA Member was partially offset by an increase in custodial revenue per HSA Member described below. Custodial revenue The $27.6 million, or 46%, increase in custodial revenue from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in average daily custodial cash of $910.3 million, or 25%, and an increase in the yield on average custodial cash from 1.58% in the year ended January 31, 2017 to 1.83% in the year ended January 31, 2018 . The $21.8 million, or 58%, increase in custodial revenue from the year ended January 31, 2016 to the year ended January 31, 2017 was primarily due to an increase in average daily custodial cash of $1.3 billion, or 57%, as well as a slight increase in the yield on average custodial cash from 1.57% in the year ended January 31, 2016 to 1.58% in the year ended January 31, 2017 . Custodial revenue as a percentage of our total revenue continues to increase primarily due to our entry into new custodial depository agreements with higher interest rates payable on average cash balances deposited thereunder, and also due to average daily custodial cash assets growing at a faster rate than the number of HSA Members, which is evidenced by an increase in custodial cash per HSA, which was $1,613, $1,595, and $1,532 as of January 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Custodial revenue per HSA Member increased by approximately 16% from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 , and approximately 8% from the year ended January 31, 2016 to the year ended January 31, 2017 , primarily due to the higher yield and higher average custodial cash balances. Interchange revenue The $9.2 million, or 22%, increase in interchange revenue from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 was due to an overall increase in the number of our HSA Members and payment activity, partially offset by the lower interchange revenue per HSA Member described below. In addition, we continued to see a trend toward more HSA spending through payment card transaction swipes and less by checks and ACH or electronic reimbursements, which increased our interchange revenue. The $14.1 million, or 51%, increase in interchange revenue from the year ended January 31, 2016 to the year ended January 31, 2017 was due to an overall increase in the number of our HSA Members and payment activity. Interchange revenue per HSA Member decreased by approximately 3% from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 , primarily due to a decrease in payment activity per HSA Member. Interchange revenue per HSA Member increased by approximately 4% from the year ended January 31, 2016 to the year ended January 31, 2017 , as a result of our efforts increase card spend on our platform. Total revenue Total revenue per HSA Member increased by 2% from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 , due to the increase in custodial revenue per HSA Member, largely offset by the decreases in service revenue and interchange revenue per HSA Member. Total revenue per HSA Member decreased by 4% from the year ended January 31, 2016 to the year ended January 31, 2017 , due to decreases in service revenue per HSA Member partially offset by increases in custodial and interchange revenue per HSA Member. - 35 - Table of Contents Cost of revenue The following table sets forth our cost of revenue for the periods indicated: (in thousands, except percentages) Year ended January 31, % change from % change from 2018 2017 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017 Service costs $ 70,426 $ 51,868 $ 39,418 36 % 32 % Custodial costs 11,400 9,767 6,522 17 % 50 % Interchange costs 12,783 10,380 8,248 23 % 26 % Total cost $ 94,609 $ 72,015 $ 54,188 31 % 33 % Service costs The $18.6 million, or 36%, increase in service costs from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 was due to the higher volume of total accounts being serviced . The $18.6 million increase includes $11.0 million related to the hiring of additional personnel to implement and support our new Network Partners and HSA Members, increased activation and processing costs of $4.4 million related to account and card activation, monthly processing of statements and other communications, as well as fraud prevention measures, stock compensation of $814,000, depreciation and amortization of $614,000, general overhead allocation of $748,000 and $1.2 million in other expenses. The $12.5 million, or 32%, increase in service costs from the year ended January 31, 2016 to the year ended January 31, 2017 was due to the higher volume of total accounts being serviced . The $12.5 million increase includes $6.1 million related to the hiring of additional personnel to implement and support our new Network Partners and HSA Members, increased activation and processing costs of $2.9 million related to account and card activation as well as monthly processing of statements and other communications, stock compensation of $692,000, depreciation and amortization of $495,000, general overhead allocation of $1.6 million and $393,000 in other expenses. Custodial costs The $1.6 million, or 17%, increase in custodial costs from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 was due to an increase in average daily custodial cash from $3.66 billion for the year ended January 31, 2017 to $4.57 billion during the year ended January 31, 2018 , which was partially offset by a decrease in custodial costs on average custodial cash from 0.27% for the year ended January 31, 2017 to 0.25% for the year ended January 31, 2018 . The $3.2 million, or 50%, increase in custodial costs from the year ended January 31, 2016 to the year ended January 31, 2017 was due to an increase in average daily custodial cash from $2.33 billion for the year ended January 31, 2016 to $3.64 billion during the year ended January 31, 2017 , which was partially offset by a decrease in custodial costs on average custodial cash from 0.28% for the year ended January 31, 2016 to 0.27% for the year ended January 31, 2017 . Interchange costs The $2.4 million, or 23%, increase in interchange costs from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 , and the $2.1 million, or 26%, increase from the year ended January 31, 2016 to the year ended January 31, 2017 , was a result of the overall increase in payment activity, which is attributable to the growth in HSA Members. Cost of revenue As we continue to add HSA Members, we expect that our cost of revenue will increase in dollar amount to support our Network Partners and members. Cost of revenue will continue to be affected by a number of different factors, including our ability to implement new technology in our Member Education Center as well as scaling our Network Partner implementation and account management functions. - 36 - Table of Contents Operating expenses The following table sets forth our operating expenses for the periods indicated: (in thousands, except percentages) Year ended January 31, % change from % change from 2018 2017 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017 Sales and marketing $ 23,139 $ 18,320 $ 13,302 26 % 38 % Technology and development 27,385 22,375 16,832 22 % 33 % General and administrative 25,111 20,151 14,113 25 % 43 % Amortization of acquired intangible assets 4,863 4,297 2,208 13 % 95 % Total operating expenses $ 80,498 $ 65,143 $ 46,455 24 % 40 % Sales and marketing The $4.9 million, or 26%, increase in sales and marketing expenses from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 primarily consisted of increased staffing and sales commissions of $2.7 million, increased stock-based compensation expense of $1.1 million, increased partner commissions of $345,000, and an increase in other expenses of $703,000. The $5.0 million, or 38%, increase in sales and marketing expenses from the year ended January 31, 2016 to the year ended January 31, 2017 primarily consisted of increased staffing and sales commissions of $2.3 million, increased partner commissions of $928,000, increased travel and marketing expenses of $862,000, increased promotion discounts of $418,000, and an increase in other expenses of $502,000. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to increase the size of our sales and marketing organization and expand into new markets. On an annual basis, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to remain steady as a percentage of our total revenue over the near term. However, our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period due to the seasonality of our total revenue and the timing and extent of our sales and marketing expenses. In addition, we expect the adoption of the new revenue standard to have a material impact on total sales and marketing expenses. We expect to capitalize incremental contract acquisition costs, such as sales commissions included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statement of operations, and amortize these costs over the average economic life of an HSA Member. The Company's current practice is to fully expense sales commissions when the member is added to the Company's platform. Technology and development The $5.0 million, or 22%, increase in technology and development expenses from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 resulted primarily from the hiring of additional personnel of $4.4 million, increased amortization and depreciation of $1.6 million, stock compensation of $1.4 million, and other expenses of $81,000, which were partially offset by a decrease in professional services of $2.0 million and an increase in capitalized engineering costs of $341,000 associated with the development and enhancement of our proprietary technology platform. The $5.5 million, or 33%, increase in technology and development expenses for the year ended January 31, 2016 to the year ended January 31, 2017 resulted primarily from the hiring of additional personnel of $3.4 million, increased amortization and depreciation of $1.9 million, information technology expenses of $1.1 million, stock compensation of $889,000, professional services of $726,000, and other expenses of $548,000, which were offset by an increase in capitalized engineering costs of $2.1 million associated with the development and enhancement of our proprietary technology platform, and redeployment of resources from technology and development to general and administrative of $855,000. We expect our technology and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in the development of our proprietary system. On an annual basis, we expect our technology and development expenses to increase as a percentage of our total revenue. Our technology and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period due to the seasonality of our total revenue and the timing and extent of our technology and development expenses. General and administrative The $5.0 million, or 25%, increase in general and administrative expenses from the year ended January 31, 2017 to the year ended January 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional personnel of $3.3 million, - 37 - Table of Contents increased stock compensation of $2.6 million and other expenses of $1.1 million, which were offset by a decrease in professional services of $2.0 million. The $6.0 million, or 43%, increase in general and administrative expenses from the year ended January 31, 2016 to the year ended January 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional personnel of $2.4 million, increased professional fees of $1.1 million, stock compensation of $922,000 and other expenses of $814,000, and redeployment of resources from technology and development to general and administrative of $855,000. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future due to the additional demands on our legal, compliance, accounting, insurance, and investor relations functions that we continue to incur as a public company, as well as other costs associated with continuing to grow our business. On an annual basis, we expect our general and administrative expenses to remain steady as a percentage of our total revenue. Our general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period due to the seasonality of our total revenue and the timing and extent of our general and administrative expenses. Amortization of acquired intangible assets The $566,000 and $2.1 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets for the years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, was attributable to the HSA portfolio asset acquisitions and acquisition of a business. On an annual basis, we expect total amortization of acquired intangible assets to remain steady. Other expense The change in other income and expense, net for the year ended January 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to an increase in ongoing acquisition-related activity costs. The change in other income and expense, net for the year ended January 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to an increase in ongoing acquisition-related activity costs and interest expense. Income tax provision Income tax provision for the years ended January 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 was $4.8 million , $13.7 million , and $8.9 million , respectively. The decrease in income tax provision during the year ended January 31, 2018 compared to the year ended January 31, 2017 was primarily the result of a $14.1 million decrease related to excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation expense recognized in the provision for income taxes, pursuant to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting as well as an increase in federal and state income taxes driven by an increase in income before income taxes netted with a decrease. The increase in income tax provision during the year ended January 31, 2017 compared to the year ended January 31, 2016 was primarily the result of an increase in federal and state income taxes driven by an increase in income before income taxes netted with an increase in research and development credits claimed. Our effective income tax rate for the years ended January 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was 9.2% , 34.3% , and 35.0% , respectively. The difference between the effective income tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate each period is impacted by a number of factors, including the relative mix of earnings among state jurisdictions, credits, excess tax benefits or shortfalls on stock-based compensation expense due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, and other discrete items. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended January 31, 2018 compared to the year ended January 31, 2017 was primarily the result of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation expense. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended January 31, 2017 compared to the year ended January 31, 2016 was primarily the result of an increase in research and development credits. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, reduced the statutory federal income tax rate from a top rate of 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Refer to Note 8. Income Taxes, within the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of this tax reform on our consolidated financial statements. Seasonality Seasonal concentration of our growth combined with our recurring revenue model create seasonal variation in our results of operations. A significant number of new and existing Network Partners bring us new HSA Members beginning in January of each year concurrent with the start of many employers benefit plan years. Before we realize any revenue from these new HSA Members, we incur costs related to implementing and supporting our new Network Partners and new HSA Members. These costs of services relate to activating accounts and hiring additional staff, including seasonal help to support our member support center. These expenses begin to ramp up during our third fiscal quarter with the majority of expenses incurred in our fourth fiscal quarter. - 38 - Table of Contents We also experience higher operating expenses in our fourth fiscal quarter due to sales commissions for new accounts activated in January. Beginning in the year ended January 31, 2019, the Company will adopt ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. As a result of this adoption, the Company will capitalize incremental contract acquisition costs, such as sales commissions, and amortize these costs over the average economic life of a member. Liquidity and capital resources Cash and marketable securities overview As of January 31, 2018 , our principal source of liquidity was our current cash and marketable securities balances, collections from our service, custodial and interchange revenue activities, and availability under our credit facility. We rely on cash provided by operating activities to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, which primarily relate to the payment of corporate payroll and other operating costs, and capital expenditures. As of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $240.3 million and $180.4 million , respectively. Capital resources As a result of our follow-on offering in May 2015, we received net proceeds of approximately $23.5 million from the sale of 972,500 shares of our common stock. On September 9, 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC. This shelf registration statement, which includes a base prospectus, allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings. Unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the base prospectus, we would use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, working capital, sales and marketing activities, general and administrative matters and capital expenditures, and if opportunities arise, for the acquisition of, or investment in, assets, technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our business. Pending such uses, we may invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing securities. In addition, we may conduct concurrent or other financings at any time. On September 30, 2015, we entered into a $100.0 million credit facility. The credit facility has a term of five years. The new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type. There were no borrowings under the facility as of January 31, 2018 . We were in compliance with all covenants as of January 31, 2018 . Use of cash Capital expenditures for the years ended January 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 were $15.8 million , $12.7 million , and $9.3 million , respectively. We expect to continue our increased capital expenditures during the year ending January 31, 2019 as we continue to devote a significant amount of our capital expenditures to improving the architecture and functionality of our proprietary system. Costs to improve the architecture of our proprietary system include software engineering services, computer hardware, and personnel and related costs for software engineering. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. To the extent these current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required, we may not be able to raise it on favorable terms, if at all. The following table shows our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the stated periods: Year ended January 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 81,702 $ 45,591 $ 26,541 Net cash used in investing activities (36,748 ) (13,054 ) (90,552 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 14,564 23,776 36,647 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 59,518 56,313 (27,364 ) Beginning cash and cash equivalents 139,954 83,641 111,005 Ending cash and cash equivalents $ 199,472 $ 139,954 $ 83,641 - 39 - Table of Contents Cash flows provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended January 31, 2018 resulted primarily from our net income of $47.4 million adjusted for the following non-cash items: depreciation and amortization of $16.0 million and stock-based compensation of $14.3 million , and changes in deferred taxes of $4.3 million, accrued compensation of $3.8 million, other long-term liabilities of $939,000, and amortization of deferred financing costs, bad debt expense, changes in inventories and accrued liabilities and other totaling $1.1 million. These were offset by changes in accounts receivable of $4.7 million and other assets and accounts payable of $1.3 million. Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended January 31, 2017 resulted primarily from our net income of $26.4 million adjusted for the following non-cash items: depreciation and amortization of $13.2 million and stock-based compensation of $8.4 million, and changes in accrued liabilities of $1.7 million, other long-term liabilities of $1.2 million, accrued compensation of $946,000, and accounts payable, amortization of deferred financing costs, bad debt expense, and inventories totaling of $698,000. These were offset by changes in deferred income taxes of $2.9 million, accounts receivable of $2.7 million and other assets of $1.3 million.

These were offset by changes in accounts receivable of $5.2 million, deferred income taxes of $2.2 million, and accrued liabilities, other long-term liabilities and other assets of $742,000. Cash flows used in investing activities. We continued to increase our purchases of software and capitalized software development costs due to continued growth. During the years ended January 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , purchases of software and capitalized software development costs were $10.4 million , $9.0 million , and $6.9 million , respectively. We also increased our purchases of property and equipment to $5.5 million , $3.6 million and $2.4 million , respectively, due to our continued growth. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended January 31, 2018 was primarily the result of the acquisition of the right to be the custodian of the First Interstate Bancsystem and Alliant Credit Union HSA portfolio acquisitions for $6.4 million and $8.0 million , respectively, as well as our acquisition of the rights to be the sole administrator of a portfolio of HSA Members for $3.3 million and an acquisition of a business for $2.9 million . Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended January 31, 2016 was primarily the result of the acquisition of the right to be the custodian of the Bancorp and M&T HSA portfolios totaling $40.5 million, the purchases of marketable securities of $40.3 million, and a $500,000 investment in a limited partnership that engages in the development of technology-based financial healthcare products. Cash flows provided by financing activities. Cash flow provided by financing activities during the year ended January 31, 2018 resulted primarily from proceeds associated with the exercise of stock options of $14.6 million . Cash flow provided by financing activities during the year ended January 31, 2017 resulted primarily from proceeds associated with the exercise of stock options of $7.1 million , and the associated tax benefits of $16.6 million . Cash flow used in financing activities during the year ended January 31, 2016 resulted primarily from our follow-on offering, from which we received net proceeds of $23.5 million from the sale of 972,500 shares of our common stock, proceeds associated with the exercise of stock options of $1.9 million, and the associated tax benefits of $11.6 million. These items were offset by deferred financing costs paid of $317,000 in conjunction with the credit agreement entered into during the year. Contractual obligations We lease office space, data storage facilities, equipment and certain maintenance requirements under long-term non-cancelable operating leases. Future minimum lease payments required under non-cancelable obligations as of January 31, 2018 are as follows: - 40 - Table of Contents Payment due by period (in thousands) Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Total Office lease obligations $ 3,904 $ 7,944 $ 8,501 $ 17,034 $ 37,383 Data storage and equipment lease obligations 343 301 68 712 Processing services agreement 825 1,650 2,475 Telephony services 288 288 Other 856 2,252 1,396 4,504 Total $ 6,216 $ 12,147 $ 9,965 $ 17,034 $ 45,362 Office lease obligations On May 15, 2015, the Company entered into a lease agreement to expand its headquarters in Draper, Utah. The lease provides for the new landlord to construct a building at its cost. The lease commenced upon the substantial completion and delivery of the building to the Company on July 1, 2016 and has an initial term of 129 months thereafter, with an option for the Company to extend the lease for two additional five-year periods. The Company is responsible for payment of taxes and operating expenses for its portion of the building, in addition to an annual base rent in the initial amount of approximately $1.0 million, with 2.5% annual increases. In conjunction with the aforementioned lease, the Company entered into an amended and restated lease agreement for its existing office space at its headquarters in Draper, Utah. The lease commenced on July 1, 2015 and has an initial term of 129 months thereafter, with an option for the Company to extend the lease for two additional five-year periods. The Company is responsible for payment of taxes and operating expenses for its portion of the building, in addition to an annual base rent in the initial amount of approximately $1.6 million, with 2.5% annual increases. On September 16, 2016, the Company amended its lease to expand its current office space. The term of the lease commenced on July 1, 2016 and will expire on March 31, 2027. The Company is responsible for payment of taxes and operating expenses for its portion of the building, in addition to an annual base rent in the initial amount of approximately $569,000 , with 2.5% annual increases. On May 31, 2017, the Company entered into an amendment to its lease agreement, dated May 15, 2015, to expand its current office space. The term of the lease commenced on January 1, 2018 and will expire on March 31, 2027. The Company is responsible for payment of taxes and operating expenses for its portion of the building, in addition to an annual base rent in the initial amount of approximately $513,000, with annual increases ranging from 2.5% to 3.1%.

Data storage and equipment lease obligations The data storage and equipment leases relate to our offsite data storage facility and office equipment leases. All of these leases expire during the year ended January 31, 2020. Telephony services The telephony service agreement relates to our 24/7/365 member support center. The agreement expires in September 2019. Processing services agreement The Company's processing services agreement with a vendor expires December 31, 2020 and requires the Company to pay a minimum processing fee based on the processing year of the agreement. The Company may terminate the agreement beginning January 1, 2020 by providing 180 days written notice. If the processing agreement is terminated prior to December 31, 2020, the Company is required to pay the vendor a termination fee, equal to 75% of the aggregate value of the minimum processing fees for the remaining years of the agreement, plus a portion of the account-boarding incentive fee. For each of the years ended January 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Company exceeded the minimum amounts required under the agreement. The Company also has agreements with several entities for access to technology and software. The agreements are based on usage, and there are no minimum required monthly payments. - 41 - Table of Contents Off-balance sheet arrangements Except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical accounting policies and significant management estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates, and in other instances, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management judgment in its application, while in other cases, management judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions. We believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our business and prospects for future performance, as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management judgment and estimates. These significant policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below. Revenue recognition We earn revenue primarily from three sources: service revenue, custodial revenue and interchange revenue. We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: (1) collectability is reasonably assured; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; and (4) there is a fixed or determinable fee. Service revenue : We charge our Network Partners or individual members a monthly service fee once a member account is set up on our system. We recognize revenue on the monthly service fees in the month during which we service each member account. In addition, we earn fees paid by employer partners and plan participants in connection with plan administrator and fiduciary services for 401(k) employer sponsors. The fees are paid on a quarterly basis and revenue is recognized in the month in which it is earned. Custodial revenue: We earn interest on custodial cash. This interest is earned from various FDIC-insured bank partners and from an annuity contract with our insurance company partner with whom we deposit our members HSA cash assets. We also receive certain administrative and recordkeeping fees for custodial investments from our investment partners and customers. We recognize this revenue in the month in which it is earned. Interchange revenue: We earn interchange revenue from card transaction swipes by our members when our members use our payment cards to pay healthcare-related claims and expenses. We recognize this revenue in the month in which it is earned. - 42 - Table of Contents Marketable securities Marketable securities consist primarily of mutual funds invested in corporate bonds, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. treasury bills, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, municipal notes, and bonds with original maturities beyond three months at the time of purchase. Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, or trading at the date of purchase. We classify marketable securities, including securities with maturities beyond twelve months, as current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. All marketable securities are recorded at their estimated fair value. Unrealized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of the related tax effect. We evaluate marketable securities to assess whether those with unrealized loss positions are other-than-temporarily impaired. We consider impairments to be other than temporary if they are related to deterioration in credit risk or if it is likely it will sell the securities before the recovery of their cost basis. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Capitalized software development costs We account for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 350-40, Internal-Use Software . Costs incurred during operation and post-implementation stages are charged to expense. Costs incurred that are directly attributable to developing or obtaining software for internal use incurred in the application development stage are capitalized. Management judgment is required in determining the point when various projects enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized. Acquisitions To determine whether an acquisition qualifies as a business combination or an asset acquisition, we make certain judgments, which include assessment of the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired group of assets. If we determine that the acquisition consists of inputs, as well as processes that when applied to those inputs have the ability to create outputs, the acquisition is determined to be a business combination. In instances where the acquired group of assets does not include sufficient inputs and processes to produce outputs, the acquisition is determined to be an asset acquisition. Under the asset acquisition method of accounting, the Company is required to fair value the assets transferred. The cost of the assets acquired is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair values and does not give rise to goodwill. If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are capitalized and subsequently amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets. Goodwill and intangible assets We apply ASC 805, Business Combinations , and ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other to account for goodwill and intangible assets. In accordance with these standards, we amortize all finite lived intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. We review finite lived intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the associated carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever a triggering event or change in circumstances occurs, at the reporting unit level. We are required to recognize an impairment charge if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Prior to our initial public offering, management used all available information to make this fair value determination, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income. After the consummation of our initial public offering, our stock price and associated market capitalization were also considered in the determination of reporting unit fair value. In addition, if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value (including the goodwill), further management judgment must be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities. No impairments for goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded during the years ended January 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . However, a lower fair value estimate in the future could result in impairment. A prolonged or significant decline in our stock price could provide evidence of a need to record a material impairment of goodwill. - 43 - Table of Contents Income taxes We account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method as set forth in the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, current tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on the tax returns for the current fiscal year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, for net operating losses, and for tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized in future years. We use the tax law ordering approach of intraperiod allocation in determining when excess tax benefits have been realized for provisions of the tax law that identify the sequence in which those amounts are utilized for tax purposes. We have also elected to exclude the indirect tax effects of share-based compensation deductions in computing the income tax provision recorded within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Also, we use the portfolio approach in releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit in the financial statements as the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained upon settlement. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of other income (expense) in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Changes in facts and circumstances could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and results of operations. In light of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, refer to Note 8. Income Taxes, within the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of this tax reform on our consolidated financial statements. Stock-based compensation Stock options. We award time-based and performance-based stock options to team members, directors, and executive officers. Stock-based compensation costs related to stock options granted are measured at the date of grant based on the estimated fair value of the award, net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. With respect to time-based stock options, the grant date fair value of stock-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. With respect to performance-based stock options, stock compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period using the graded-vesting attribution method when it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. Each reporting period, we evaluate the probability of achieving the performance criteria and of the number of shares that are expected to vest; compensation expense is then adjusted to reflect the number of shares expected to vest. Accordingly, the expense recognized is an estimate that may change over time as key assumptions are updated. We expect to continue to grant stock options in the future, and to the extent that we do, our stock-based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards. If we had made different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense, net income and net income per share of common stock could have been significantly different. These assumptions include: Expected volatility: As we do not have adequate length of trading history for our common stock, the expected stock price volatility for our common stock was estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for industry peers based on daily price observations. We did not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers common stock because the volume of activity was relatively low. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation. - 44 - Table of Contents Expected term: The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We use the "simplified" method to estimate the expected term as determined under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110 due to the lack of option exercise history as a public company. Risk-free interest rate: The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group. Expected dividend yield: We have never declared or paid any cash dividends to our common stockholders and do not presently plan to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, other than in connection with the special dividend described in Item 5- Market for registrant's common equity, related stockholders matters and issuer purchases of equity securities. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of options granted during the periods presented: Year ended January 31, 2018 2017 2016 Expected dividend yield % % % Expected stock price volatility 37.79% - 38.01% 38.01% - 38.37% 38.29% - 40.29% Risk-free interest rate 1.18% - 2.07% 1.18% - 2.18% 1.47% - 1.80% Expected life of options 4.50 - 6.25 years 4.50 - 6.25 years 5.43 - 6.25 years We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions utilized for our stock-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis. The estimated fair value of a stock option using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is impacted significantly by changes in a company stock price. For example, all other assumptions being equal, the estimated fair value of a stock option will increase as the closing price of a company stock increases, and vice versa. Prior to the closing of the IPO, we were a private company and, as such, we were required to estimate the fair value of our common stock. In the absence of a public trading market, we determined a reasonable estimate of the then-current fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting stock-based compensation based on multiple criteria. We estimated the fair value of our common stock utilizing methodologies, approaches and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation", or the AICPA Practice Aid. After closing of the IPO, the fair value of our common stock is no longer an estimate as it is based upon the closing price of our stock on the NASDAQ Market on the date of grant. Restricted stock units. Restricted stock units and performance-based RSUs are valued based on the current value of the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant, less the present value of future expected dividends discounted at the risk-free interest rate. Expense for restricted stock units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is considered probable that the performance conditions will be met. Self insurance We are self-insured for medical and dental benefits for all qualifying employees. The medical plan carries a stop-loss policy which will protect from individual claims during the plan year exceeding $110,000 . We record estimates of costs of claims incurred but not reported based on an analysis of historical data and independent estimates. Recent accounting pronouncements See Note 1.
