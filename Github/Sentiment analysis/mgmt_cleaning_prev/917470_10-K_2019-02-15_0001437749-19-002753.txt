ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A , Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview We are a leading metals service center that operates in three reportable segments; carbon flat products, specialty metals flat products, and tubular and pipe products. We provide metals processing and distribution services for a wide range of customers. Our carbon flat products segment focus is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. Our specialty metals flat products segment focus is on the direct sale and distribution of processed aluminum and stainless flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products and fabricated parts. Through the acquisition of Berlin Metals on April 2, 2018, our specialty metals flat products segment expanded its product offerings to include differing types of stainless flat-rolled sheet and coil and prime tin mill products. In addition, we distribute metal tubing, pipe, bar, valves and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets through our tubular and pipe products segment. Products that require more value-added processing generally have a higher gross profit. Accordingly, our overall gross profit is affected by, among other things, product mix, the amount of processing performed, the demand for and availability of metals, and volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs. We also perform toll processing of customer-owned metals. We sell certain products internationally, primarily in Canada and Mexico. International sales are immaterial to our consolidated financial results and to the individual segments results. Our results of operations are affected by numerous external factors including, but not limited to: general and global business, economic, financial, banking and political conditions; fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies, competition; metals pricing, demand and availability; transportation and energy costs; pricing and availability of raw materials used in the production of metals; global supply, the level of metals imported into the United States, tariffs, and inventory held in the supply chain; the availability, and increased costs of labor; customers ability to manage their credit line availability; and layoffs or work stoppages by our own, our suppliers or our customers personnel. The metals industry also continues to be affected by the global consolidation of our suppliers, competitors and end-use customers. Like other metals service centers, we maintain substantial inventories of metals to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon customer forecasts, historic buying practices, supply agreements with customers and market conditions. Our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. From time to time, we have entered into nickel swaps at the request of our customers in order to mitigate our customers risk of volatility in the price of metals, and we have entered into metals hedges to mitigate our risk of volatility in the price of metals. We have no long-term, fixed-price metals purchase contracts. When metals prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower gross profits and earnings as we use existing metals inventory. When metals prices increase, competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers. To the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers, the net sales and gross profits of our business could be adversely affected. We operate in three reportable segments; carbon flat products, specialty metals flat products and tubular and pipe products. The carbon flat products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment are at times consolidated and referred to as the flat products segment. Some of the flat products segments assets and resources are shared by the carbon and specialty metals segments and both segments products are stored in the shared facilities and, in some locations, processed on shared equipment. As such, total assets and capital expenditures are reported in the aggregate for the flat products segments. Due to the shared assets and resources, certain of the flat products segment expenses are allocated between the carbon flat products segment and the specialty metals flat products segment based upon an established allocation methodology. We follow the accounting guidance that requires the utilization of a management approach to define and report the financial results of operating segments. The management approach defines operating segments along the lines used by the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, to assess performance and make operating and resource allocation decisions. Our CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based primarily on operating income. Our operating segments are based primarily on internal management reporting. Page 26 Due to the nature of the products sold in each segment, there are significant differences in the segments average selling price and the cost of materials sold. The tubular and pipe products segment generally has the highest average selling price among the three segments followed by the specialty metals flat products and carbon flat products segments. Due to the nature of the tubular and pipe products, we do not report tons sold or per ton information. Gross profit per ton is generally higher in the specialty metals flat products segment than the carbon flat products segment. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales is generally highest in the tubular and pipe products segment, followed by the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments. Due to the differences in average selling prices, gross profit and gross profit percentage among the segments, a change in the mix of sales could impact total net sales, gross profit, and gross profit percentage. In addition, certain inventory in the tubular and pipe products segment is valued under the LIFO method. Adjustments to the LIFO inventory value are recorded to cost of materials sold and may impact the gross margin and gross margin percentage at the consolidated Company and tubular and pipe products segment levels. Carbon flat products The primary focus of our carbon flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in most metals consuming industries, including manufacturers and fabricators of transportation and material handling equipment, construction and farm machinery, storage tanks, environmental and energy generation equipment, automobiles, military vehicles and equipment, as well as general and plate fabricators and metals service centers. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force. Specialty metals flat products The primary focus of our specialty metals flat products segment is on the direct sale and distribution of processed stainless and aluminum flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products and fabricated parts. Through its acquisition of Berlin Metals on April 2, 2018, our specialty metals flat products segment expanded its product offerings to include differing types of stainless flat-rolled sheet and coil and prime tin mill products. We act as an intermediary between metals producers and manufacturers that require processed metals for their operations. We serve customers in various industries, including manufacturers of food service and commercial appliances, agriculture equipment, transportation and automotive equipment. We distribute these products primarily through a direct sales force. Combined, the carbon and specialty metals flat products segments have 21 strategically-located processing and distribution facilities in the United States and one in Monterrey, Mexico. Many of our facilities service both the carbon and the specialty metals flat products segments, and certain assets and resources are shared by the segments. Our geographic footprint allows us to focus on regional customers and larger national and multi-national accounts, primarily located throughout the midwestern, eastern and southern United States. Tubular and pipe products The tubular and pipe products segment consists of the CTI business, acquired in 2011. Through our tubular and pipe products segment, we distribute metal tubing, pipe, bar, valve and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets. Founded in 1914, CTI operates from eight locations in the midwestern and southeastern United States. The tubular and pipe products segment distributes its products primarily through a direct sales force. Corporate expenses Corporate expenses are reported as a separate line item for segment reporting purposes. Corporate expenses include the unallocated expenses related to managing the entire Company (i.e., all three segments), including compensation for certain personnel, expenses related to being a publicly traded entity such as board of directors expenses, audit expenses, and various other professional fees. Page 27 Results of Operations 201 8 Compared to 201 7 Our results of operations are impacted by the market price of metals. Through the first seven months of 2018, metals prices increased significantly and changes to our net sales, cost of materials sold, gross profit, cost of inventory and profitability, were all impacted by industry metals pricing. The price increases resulted in metals pricing reaching its highest point in 10 years. The increases were driven by both the tariffs initiated by the U.S. government in 2018 under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (section 232 tariffs) and strong customer demand. During the remainder of the year, market prices for metals declined from the prior months, but overall market prices for metal in 2018 were still higher than in 2017. The pricing decline in the third and fourth quarters caused gross margin pressure as higher priced material was applied to orders. We expect the margin pressure to continue into the first quarter of 2019. Transactional or spot selling prices generally move in tandem with market price changes, while fixed selling prices typically lag and reset quarterly. Similarly, inventory costs (and, therefore, cost of materials sold) tend to move slower than market selling price changes due to mill lead times and inventory turnover impacting the rate of change in average cost. When average selling prices increase, and net sales increase, gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales will generally decrease. Operating results for 2018 include the additional revenues and operating expenses resulting from the acquisition of Berlin Metals on April 2, 2018. During the second quarter of 2017, we announced the permanent closure of our carbon flat products segment Siler City, North Carolina operation. The facility ceased operations in the third quarter of 2017. The land and building associated with the operation was sold in July 2018 at net book value. The operating loss related to the Siler City, North Carolina operation was immaterial in 2018 compared to $1.4 million in 2017. The following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars shown in thousands): 2018 2017 $ % of net sales $ % of net sales Net sales $ 1,715,081 100.0 $ 1,330,696 100.0 Cost of materials sold (a) 1,372,954 80.1 1,055,212 79.3 Gross profit (b) 342,127 19.9 275,484 20.7 Operating expenses (c) 285,075 16.6 251,498 18.9 Operating income 57,052 3.3 23,986 1.8 Other loss, net (307 ) (0.0 ) (118 ) (0.0 ) Interest and other expense on debt 10,681 0.6 7,518 0.6 Income before income taxes 46,064 2.7 16,350 1.2 Income taxes (d) 12,305 0.7 (2,613 ) (0.2 ) Net income $ 33,759 2.0 $ 18,963 1.4 (a) Includes $8,408 and $2,707 of LIFO expense for 2018 and 2017, respectively. (b) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (c) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. (d) 2017 includes a $6.2 million tax benefit related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Net sales increased $384.4 million, or 28.9%, to $1.72 billion in 2018 from $1.33 billion in 2017. Carbon flat products net sales increased $203.7 million, or 23.4%, and were 62.6% of total net sales in 2018 compared to 65.4% in 2017. Specialty metals flat products net sales increased $116.3 million, or 51.2%, and were 20.0% of total net sales in 2018 compared to 17.1% in 2017. Tubular and pipe products net sales increased $64.4 million, or 27.6%, and were 17.4% of total net sales in 2018 compared to 17.6% of total net sales in 2017. The increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to a 23.5% increase in average selling prices and a 4.3% increase in sales volume. Average selling prices increased in all segments during 2018 compared to 2017 as market pricing for metals was higher year-over-year. Sales volumes increased in the specialty metals flat products segment due to the acquisition of Berlin Metals and increased customer demand, and in the tubular and pipe products segment due to increased customer demand. The decrease in tons sold in the carbon flat products segment is due to the strategic decision to eliminate low margin international trading sales in 2018 and the closure of our North Carolina operation in the third quarter of 2017. Page 28 Cost of materials sold increased $317.7 million, or 30.1%, to $1.37 billion in 2018 from $1.06 billion in 2017. During 2018, we recorded LIFO expense of $8.4 million compared to $2.7 million in 2017. The increase in cost of materials sold in 2018 is primarily related to increased market metals pricing discussed above and increased sales volume. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) decreased to 19.9% in 2018 from 20.7% in 2017. LIFO expense decreased gross profit by 0.5% of net sales in 2018 and by 0.2% of net sales in 2017. The decrease in 2018 gross profit as a percentage of net sales is due to the impact of higher average selling prices, as the average gross profit per ton increased in 2018 compared to 2017. Operating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) increased $33.6 million, or 13.4%, to $285.1 million in 2018 from $251.5 million in 2017. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 16.6% in 2018 from 18.9% in 2017. Operating expenses increased in all categories as reported on the Company Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Operating expenses related to the Berlin Metals acquisition on April 2, 2018 accounted for 21.6% of the operating expense increase. Variable operating expenses, such as warehouse and processing, increased as a result of increased sales volume and increased labor hours at our current operating facilities. Selling and administrative and general expenses increased as a result of increased labor expenses and increased variable based incentive compensation related to increased profitability. Operating expenses in the carbon flat products segment increased $15.0 million, operating expenses in the specialty metals products segment increased $11.9 million, operating expenses in the tubular and pipe products segment increased $2.3 million, and Corporate expenses increased $4.4 million. Interest and other expense on debt totaled $10.7 million in 2018 compared to $7.5 million in 2017. Our effective borrowing rate, exclusive of deferred financing fees and commitment fees, was 3.7% in 2018 compared to 3.0% in 2017 due to the increases in LIBOR rates since 2017. Total average borrowings increased $74.7 million, or 33.9%, to $275.3 million in 2018 from $200.6 million in 2017, primarily related to increased working capital needs in 2018. Income before income taxes totaled $46.1 million in 2018 compared to $16.4 million in 2017. An income tax provision of 26.7% was recorded in 2018, compared to an income tax benefit of 16.0% in 2017. The decreased effective tax rate in 2018, is a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, signed on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result, our 2017 effective tax rate included a one-time $6.2 million benefit from a revaluation of our deferred tax liability to the new corporate income tax rate. The 2017 effective tax rate also included an out-of-period adjustment to correct and record previously unrecognized deferred tax assets, and the associated tax benefit, related to our supplemental executive retirement plan recorded in the first quarter of 2017. The adjustment, which had accumulated since the inception of the plan in 2005, resulted in an increase to after-tax income of $1.9 million. Net income for 2018 totaled $33.8 million, or $2.95 per basic and diluted share, compared to $19.0 million, or $1.67 per basic and diluted share, for 2017. Page 29 S egment Results of Operations Carbon f lat products The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the carbon flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data): 2018 2017 $ % of net sales $ % of net sales Direct tons sold 1,060,990 1,060,002 Toll tons sold 81,381 87,748 Total tons sold 1,142,371 1,147,750 Net sales $ 1,073,292 100.0 $ 869,628 100.0 Average selling price per ton 940 758 Cost of materials sold 855,942 79.7 693,742 79.8 Gross profit (a) 217,350 20.3 175,886 20.2 Operating expenses (b) 172,996 16.1 158,000 18.2 Operating income $ 44,354 4.2 $ 17,886 2.0 (a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (b) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. Tons sold decreased 5 thousand tons, or 0.5%, to 1.14 million tons in 2018 from 1.15 million tons in 2017. Toll tons sold decreased 7 thousand tons, or 7.3% to 81 thousand tons in 2018 from 88 thousand tons in 2016. The decrease in tons sold is due to the strategic decision to eliminate low margin international trading sales in 2018 and the closure of our North Carolina operation in the third quarter of 2017, which accounted for a decrease year-over-year of approximately 35 thousand tons. Excluding these strategic decisions, the carbon flat products segment experienced a 2.6% tonnage increase in 2018 compared to 2017. Customer demand was strong during 2018. Net sales increased $203.7 million, or 23.4%, to $1.1 billion in 2018 from $869.6 million in 2017. Average selling prices in 2018 increased 24.0% to $940 per ton, compared to $758 per ton in 2017. The increase in sales was due to the increase in average selling prices, as sales volume remained relatively flat. The increase in the average selling price is a result of higher prices in the metals industry during 2018, as discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above. We expect carbon flat metals market prices in the first quarter of 2019 to decrease from fourth quarter 2018 prices. Cost of materials sold increased $162.2 million, or 23.4%, to $855.9 million in 2018 from $693.7 million in 2017. The increase was due to the increased market price for metals discussed above. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) increased to 20.3% in 2018 from 20.2% in 2017. The average gross profit per ton sold increased $37 per ton to $190 in 2018 from $153 in 2017. Operating expenses in 2018 increased $15.0 million, or 9.5%, to $173.0 million from $158.0 million in 2017. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 16.1% in 2018 from 18.2% in 2017. Variable operating expenses, such as warehouse and processing, increased as a result of increased sales volume and increased labor hours at our current operating facilities. Other operating expenses increased as a result of increased distribution expense, labor expenses and increased variable performance based incentive compensation related to increased profitability. Operating income for 2018 totaled $44.4 million compared to $17.9 million in 2017. Page 30 S pecialty metals flat products The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the specialty metals flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data): 2018 2017 $ % of net sales $ % of net sales Direct tons sold 125,870 90,106 Toll tons sold 9,717 54 Total tons sold 135,587 90,160 Net sales $ 343,479 100.0 $ 227,200 100.0 Average selling price per ton 2,533 2,520 Cost of materials sold 294,553 85.8 194,199 85.5 Gross profit (a) 48,926 14.2 33,001 14.5 Operating expenses (b) 33,678 9.8 21,761 9.6 Operating income $ 15,248 4.4 $ 11,240 4.9 (a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (b) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. Tons sold increased 45 thousand tons, or 50.4%, to 136 thousand tons in 2018 from 90 thousand tons in 2017. The increase in tons sold is due to the acquisition of Berlin Metals on April 2, 2018 and improved customer demand in the markets we served during 2018. Net sales increased $116.3 million, or 51.2%, to $343.5 million in 2018 from $227.2 million in 2017. The increase in net sales is due to the acquisition of Berlin Metals on April 2, 2018 and improved customer demand in the markets we served during 2018. Average selling prices in 2018 increased to $2,533 per ton, compared to $2,520 per ton in 2017. The increase in the average selling price is a result of higher prices in the metals industry during 2018 as discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above. We expect stainless steel and aluminum market prices in the first quarter of 2019 to decrease from fourth quarter 2018 prices. Cost of materials sold increased $100.4 million, or 51.7%, to $294.6 million in 2018 from $194.2 million in 2017. The increase in cost of materials sold was primarily due to the increase in sales volume in 2018 compared to 2017. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) decreased to 14.2% in 2018 from 14.5% in 2017. The average gross profit per ton sold totaled $361 in 2018 compared to $366 per ton in 2017. The decrease in the gross profit percentage is a result of relatively flat gross margins per ton realized on higher average selling prices in 2018. Operating expenses (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased $11.9 million, or 54.8%, to $33.7 million in 2018 from $21.8 million in 2017. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to 9.8% of net sales in 2018 from 9.6% in 2017. Operating expenses increased due to the acquisition of Berlin Metals on April 2, 2018. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution and warehouse and processing increased as a result of higher sales volumes. Selling and administrative and general expenses increased primarily as a result of increased variable based incentive compensation related to the increased sales volume, gross profit and operating income. Operating income for 2018 totaled $15.2 million compared to $11.2 million in 2017. Page 31 Tubular and pipe products The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the tubular and pipe products segment for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars shown in thousands). 2018 2017 $ % of net sales $ % of net sales Net sales $ 298,310 100.0 $ 233,868 100.0 Cost of materials sold (a) 222,459 74.6 167,271 71.5 Gross profit (b) 75,851 25.4 66,597 28.5 Operating expenses (c) 64,331 21.5 62,029 26.5 Operating income $ 11,520 3.9 $ 4,568 2.0 (a) Includes $8,408 and $2,707 of LIFO expense in 2018 and 2017, respectively. (b) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (c) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. Net sales increased $64.4 million, or 27.6%, to $298.3 million in 2018 from $233.9 million in 2017. The increase in net sales was due to a 20.4% increase in sales volume and a 6.0% increase in average selling prices during 2018. The increase in volume was primarily due to new customer demand. The increase in the average selling price is a result of higher prices in the metals industry during 2018 as discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above. We expect tubular and pipe products market prices in the first quarter of 2019 to decrease from fourth quarter 2018 prices Cost of materials sold increased $55.2 million, or 33.0%, to $222.5 million in 2018 from $167.3 million in 2017. The increase in cost of materials sold was due to a 20.4% increase in sales volume and a 10.5% increase in the average cost of materials sold which was impacted by the LIFO expense of $8.4 million in 2018 compared to $2.7 million in 2017. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) decreased to 25.4% in 2018 compared to 28.5%, in 2017. The LIFO expense decreased gross profit by 2.8% of net sales in 2018 compared to 1.2% of net sales in 2017. In addition, tubular and pipe products segment gross profit decreased as a result of a change in sales mix to more pipe and fitting products, which traditionally have a lower gross profit, from higher gross profit fabrication product sales. Operating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) increased $2.3 million, or 3.7%, to $64.3 million in 2018 from $62.0 million in 2017. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 21.5% in 2018 compared to 26.5% in 2017. Operating expenses increased in 2018 primarily as a result of increased distribution expense related to increased shipments and increased labor hours and variable incentive compensation related to increased gross profit and operating income. Operating income for 2018 totaled $11.5 million, compared to $4.6 million in 2017. Corporate expenses Corporate expenses increased $4.4 million, or 44.9%, to $14.1 million in 2018 compared to $9.7 million in 2017. The increase in corporate expenses is primarily attributable to increased variable incentive compensation related to increased operating income, and the professional fees incurred in connection with the Berlin Metals acquisition on April 2, 2018 and the McCullough acquisition on January 2, 2019. 201 7 Compared to 201 6 During 2017 and 2016, metals prices fluctuated significantly and changes to our net sales, cost of materials sold, gross profit, cost of inventory and profitability, were all impacted by industry metals pricing. Metals market prices in December 2017 were approximately 7% and 77% higher than metals market prices in December of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Average quarterly metals market prices during 2017 remained relatively flat after increasing in the first quarter of 2017 and were higher than the average quarterly metals market prices in the comparable quarters of 2016. Page 32 During the second quarter of 2017, we announced the permanent closure of our carbon flat products segment Siler City, North Carolina operation. The facility ceased operations in the third quarter of 2017. The land and building associated with the operation was classified as Assets held for sale on the accompanying December 31, 2017 Consolidated Balance Sheet and subsequently sold in 2018. The operating loss related to the Siler City, North Carolina operation was $1.4 million in 2017. The following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars shown in thousands): 2017 2016 $ % of net sales $ % of net sales Net sales $ 1,330,696 100.0 $ 1,055,116 100.0 Cost of materials sold (a) 1,055,212 79.3 820,040 77.7 Gross profit (b) 275,484 20.7 235,076 22.3 Operating expenses (c) 251,498 18.9 229,328 21.7 Operating income 23,986 1.8 5,748 0.5 Other loss, net (118 ) (0.0 ) (55 ) (0.0 ) Interest and other expense on debt 7,518 0.6 5,273 0.5 Income before income taxes 16,350 1.2 420 0.0 Income taxes (d) (2,613 ) (0.2 ) 1,498 0.1 Net income (loss) $ 18,963 1.4 $ (1,078 ) (0.1 ) (a) Includes $2,707 of LIFO expense and $1,489 of LIFO income for 2017 and 2016, respectively. (b) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (c) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. (d) 2017 includes a $6.2 million tax benefit related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Net sales increased $275.6 million, or 26.1%, to $1.33 billion in 2017 from $1.06 billion in 2016. Carbon flat products net sales increased $198.6 million, or 29.6%, and were 65.4% of total net sales in 2017 compared to 63.6% in 2016. Specialty metals flat products net sales increased $37.3 million, or 19.6%, and were 17.1% of total net sales in 2017 compared to 18.0% in 2016. Tubular and pipe products net sales increased $39.7 million, or 20.4%, and were 17.6% of total net sales in 2017 compared to 18.4% of total net sales in 2016. The increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to an 11.3% increase in sales volume and a 13.3% increase in average selling prices. Average selling prices increased in all segments during 2017 compared to 2016 as market pricing for metals was higher year-over-year. Cost of materials sold increased $235.2 million, or 28.7%, to $1.06 billion in 2017 from $820.0 million in 2016. During 2017, we recorded LIFO expense of $2.7 million compared to LIFO income of $1.5 million in 2016. The increase in cost of materials sold in 2017 was due to the increased sales volume and increased metals costs of 15.6% during 2017. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) decreased to 20.7% in 2017 from 22.3% in 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in the carbon flat products segment to 20.2% from 21.2% in 2016, in the specialty metals flat products segment to 14.5% in 2017 from 15.7% in 2016 and in the tubular and pipe products segment to 28.5% from 32.6% in 2016. LIFO expense decreased gross profit by 0.2% of net sales in 2017 and the LIFO income increased gross profit by 0.1% of net sales in 2016. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales during 2017 was due to the cost of materials sold increasing more than selling prices in all segments and the increase of carbon flat products sales as a percentage of total net sales. Operating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) increased $22.2 million, or 9.7%, to $251.5 million in 2017 from $229.3 million in 2016. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 18.9% in 2017 from 21.7% in 2016. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution and warehouse and processing, increased primarily related to the 11.3% volume increase. Distribution expense, in addition to the volume increase, increased as a result of the continued inflationary pressures for freight. Warehouse and processing costs increased $7.9 million, or 9.9%, and distribution expense increased by $5.3 million, or 14.5%. Selling and administrative and general costs increased $9.8 million, or 11.4%, primarily related to increased variable based incentive compensation based on increased sales volumes and profitability. Depreciation expense decreased $1.0 million, or 5.7%, as a result of certain assets being fully depreciated in 2017. Operating expenses in the carbon flat products segment increased $11.7 million, operating expenses in the specialty metals products segment increased $1.9 million, operating expenses in the tubular and pipe products segment increased $6.3 million, and Corporate expenses increased $2.3 million. Page 33 Interest and other expense on debt totaled $7.5 million in 2017 compared to $5.3 million in 2016. Our effective borrowing rate, exclusive of deferred financing fees and commitment fees, was 3.0% in 2017 compared to 2.4% in 2016 due to the increases in LIBOR rates since 2016. Total average borrowings increased $48 million, or 31.5%, from $152.5 million in 2016 to $200.6 million in 2017, primarily related to increased working capital needs in 2017. Income before income taxes totaled $16.4 million in 2017 compared to $0.4 million in 2016. An income tax benefit of (16.0%) was recorded for 2017, compared to an income tax provision of 356.6% in 2016. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed the Tax Act. As a result, our 2017 effective tax rate included a one-time $6.2 million benefit from a revaluation of our deferred tax liability to the new corporate income tax rate. The net benefit recorded was based on currently available information and interpretations of applying the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act as of the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 118 issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, the income tax effect for certain aspects of the Tax Act represent provisional amounts for which our accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate could be determined and recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017. The 2017 effective tax rate also included an out-of-period adjustment to correct and record previously unrecognized deferred tax assets, and the associated tax benefit, related to our supplemental executive retirement plan recorded in the first quarter of 2017. The adjustment, which had accumulated since the inception of the plan in 2005, resulted in an increase to after-tax income of $1.9 million. The effective tax rate was disproportionately high in 2016 due to low income before taxes relative to items that impact the effective tax rate. The 2016 effective income tax rate was also impacted by increased valuation allowances and non-deductible expenses. Net income for 2017 totaled $19.0 million, or $1.67 per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $1.1 million, or $0.10 per basic and diluted share, for 2016. Segment Results of Operations Carbon flat products The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the carbon flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data): 2017 2016 $ % of net sales $ % of net sales Direct tons sold 1,060,002 952,888 Toll tons sold 87,748 73,880 Total tons sold 1,147,750 1,026,768 Net sales $ 869,628 100.0 $ 670,983 100.0 Average selling price per ton 758 653 Cost of materials sold 693,742 79.8 529,021 78.8 Gross profit (a) 175,886 20.2 141,962 21.2 Operating expenses (b) 158,000 18.2 146,333 21.8 Operating income (loss) $ 17,886 2.0 $ (4,371 ) (0.6 ) (a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (b) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. Tons sold increased 121 thousand tons, or 11.8%, to 1.15 million tons in 2017 from 1.03 million tons in 2016. Toll tons sold increased 14 thousand tons, or 18.8% to 88 thousand tons in 2017 from 74 thousand tons in 2016. The increase in tons sold was due to improved customer demand in the markets we served and improved industry-wide shipments by U.S. service centers in 2017 compared to 2016. Net sales increased $198.6 million, or 29.6%, to $869.6 million in 2017 from $671.0 million in 2016. Average selling prices in 2017 increased 15.9% to $758 per ton, compared to $653 per ton in 2016. The increase in sales was due to the 15.9% increase in average selling prices and the 11.8% increase in sales volume. The increase in the average selling price was a result of higher prices in the metals industry during 2017 as discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above. Page 34 Cost of materials sold increased $164.7 million, or 31.1%, to $693.7 million in 2017 from $529.0 million in 2016. The increase in cost of materials sold was due to a 17.3% increase in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2017 compared to 2016 and the 11.8% increase in sales volume. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) decreased to 20.2% in 2017 from 21.2% in 2016. The average gross profit per ton sold increased $15 per ton to $153 in 2017 from $138 in 2016. Operating expenses in 2017 increased $11.7 million, or 8.0%, to $158.0 million from $146.3 million in 2016. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 18.2% for 2017 from 21.8% in 2016. The percentage increase in operating expenses in 2017 were less than the volume increases during the year. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution and warehouse and processing, increased as a result of increased sales volume and distribution cost inflation. Selling and administrative and general expenses increased primarily as a result of increased variable performance based incentive compensation. Operating income for 2017 totaled $17.9 million compared to operating loss of $4.4 million in 2016. Specialty metals flat products The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the specialty metals flat products segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars shown in thousands, except per ton data): 2017 2016 $ % of net sales $ % of net sales Direct tons sold 90,106 82,156 Toll tons sold 54 129 Total tons sold 90,160 82,285 Net sales $ 227,200 100.0 $ 189,930 100.0 Average selling price per ton 2,520 2,308 Cost of materials sold 194,199 85.5 160,185 84.3 Gross profit (a) 33,001 14.5 29,745 15.7 Operating expenses (b) 21,761 9.6 19,904 10.5 Operating income $ 11,240 4.9 $ 9,841 5.2 (a) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (b) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. Tons sold increased 8 thousand tons, or 9.6%, to 90 thousand tons in 2017 from 82 thousand tons in 2016. The increase in tons sold was due to improved customer demand in the markets we served. Industry-wide shipments increased in 2017 compared to 2016. Net sales increased $37.3 million, or 19.6%, to $227.2 million in 2017 from $189.9 million in 2016. Average selling prices in 2017 increased to $2,520 per ton, compared to $2,308 per ton in 2016. The increase in the average selling price was a result of higher prices in the metals industry during 2017 as discussed in the overview of Results of Operations above. Cost of materials sold increased $34.0 million, or 21.2%, to $194.2 million in 2017 from $160.2 million in 2016. The increase in cost of materials sold was due to a 10.6% increase in the average cost of materials sold per ton during 2017 compared to 2016 and the 9.6% volume increase. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (a) in the table above) decreased to 14.5% in 2017 from 15.7% in 2016. The average gross profit per ton sold totaled $366 in 2017 compared to $361 per ton in 2016. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was a result of relatively flat gross margins per ton realized on higher average selling prices in 2017. Page 35 Operating expenses (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) increased $1.9 million, or 9.3%, to $21.8 million in 2017 from $19.9 million in 2016. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 9.6% of net sales in 2017 from 10.5% in 2016. Variable operating expenses, such as distribution and warehouse and processing, increased as a result of increased sales volume and distribution cost inflation. Selling and administrative and general expenses increased primarily as a result of increased variable based incentive compensation related to the increased sales volume and gross profit. Operating income for 2017 totaled $11.2 million compared to $9.8 million in 2016. Tubular and pipe products The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the tubular and pipe products segment for 2017 and 2016 (dollars shown in thousands). 2017 2016 $ % of net sales $ % of net sales Net sales $ 233,868 100.0 $ 194,203 100.0 Cost of materials sold (a) 167,271 71.5 130,834 67.4 Gross profit (b) 66,597 28.5 63,369 32.6 Operating expenses (c) 62,029 26.5 55,656 28.7 Operating income $ 4,568 2.0 $ 7,713 3.9 (a) Includes $2,707 of LIFO expense and $1,489 of LIFO income in 2017 and 2016, respectively. (b) Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold. (c) Operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold. Net sales increased $39.7 million, or 20.4%, to $233.9 million in 2017 from $194.2 million in 2016. The increase in net sales was due to a 12.6% increase in average selling prices and a 6.9% increase in sales volume during 2017. The increase in volume was due to increased customer demand despite lower industry-wide shipments of pipe and tube products. The increase in the average selling price was a result of higher prices in the metals industry during 2017. Cost of materials sold increased $36.5 million, or 27.8%, to $167.3 million in 2017 from $130.8 million in 2016. The increase in cost of materials sold was due to a 12.6% increase in sales volume and a 19.6% increase in the average cost of materials sold which was impacted by the LIFO expense of $2.7 million in 2017 compared to LIFO income of $1.5 million in 2016. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit (as defined in footnote (b) in the table above) decreased to 28.5% in 2017 compared to 32.6%, in 2016. The LIFO expense decreased gross profit by 1.2% of net sales in 2017 compared to the LIFO income which increased gross profit by 0.8% of net sales in 2016. In addition, tubular and pipe products segment gross profit decreased as a result of a change in sales mix to more pipe and fitting products, which traditionally has a lower gross profit, from higher gross profit fabrication product sales. Operating expenses (as defined in footnote (c) in the table above) increased $6.3 million, or 11.6%, to $62.0 million from $55.7 million in 2016. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 26.5% in 2017 compared to 28.7% in 2016. Operating expenses increased in 2017 primarily as a result of increased distribution expense related to increased shipments and distribution cost inflation, less labor and overhead capitalized into inventory, and increased variable incentive compensation related to increased gross profit and costs associated with a settlement of a commercial dispute. Operating income for 2017 totaled $4.6 million, compared to $7.7 million in 2016. Corporate expenses Corporate expenses increased $2.3 million, or 30.6%, to $9.7 million in 2017 compared to $7.4 million in 2016. The increase in corporate expenses was primarily attributable to increased variable performance based incentive compensation and, effective August 2016, when our President of Specialty Metals was appointed to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, his associated costs were classified as Corporate expenses. Page 36 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Cash Flows Our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs, purchasing, upgrading and acquiring processing equipment and facilities, making acquisitions and paying dividends. We use cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility to fund these requirements. We believe that funds available under our credit facility together with funds generated from operations, will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to fund anticipated working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, our dividend payments and any share repurchases and business acquisitions over at least the next 12 months. In the future, we may as part of our business strategy, acquire and dispose of assets or other companies in the same or complementary lines of business, or enter into or exit strategic alliances and joint ventures. Accordingly, the timing and size of our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. 201 8 Compared to 2017 Operating Activities During 2018, we used $50.5 million of net cash for operations, of which $53.9 million was generated from operating activities and $104.4 million was used for working capital. Net cash from operations during 2018 was primarily comprised of net income of $33.8 million. During 2017, we used $19.0 million of cash for operations, of which $26.7 million was generated from operating activities and $45.7 million was used for working capital. Net cash from operations during 2017 primarily comprised of net income of $18.9 million offset by the net change in long-term assets and liabilities of $11.9 million, which includes the $6.2 million tax benefit related to the Tax Act. Working capital at December 31, 2018 totaled $434.3 million, a $125.4 million increase from December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a $78.7 million increase in inventory (resulting from higher inventory levels and higher average inventory costs in 2018 compared to 2017), and a $35.9 million increase in accounts receivable (resulting primarily from higher sales prices in 2018) offset by a $3.9 million increase in accounts payable and outstanding checks (resulting from the increased inventory purchases at the end of 2018) and a $6.2 million increase in accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities. Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities was $47.5 million during 2018, compared to $9.2 million during 2017. Investment activities in 2018 includes the acquisition of Berlin Metals for $21.9 million and $25.7 million of capital expenditures, primarily attributable to a building expansion and additional processing equipment at our existing facilities. During 2019, we expect our capital spending to be less than our annual depreciation expense. Financing Activities During 2018, $104.3 million of cash was generated from financing activities, which primarily consisted of $106.3 million of net borrowings under our Second Amendment to Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, or ABL Credit Facility, to fund the continued rising metals prices and working capital needs and the acquisition of Berlin Metals on April 2, 2018 offset by the final Industrial Revenue Bond (IRB) payment of $0.9 million and $0.9 million of dividends paid. During 2017, $28.9 million of cash was generated from financing activities, which primarily consisted of $31.6 million of net borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility offset by a $0.9 million IRB repayment and $0.9 million of dividends paid. In February 2019, our Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share, which is payable on March 15, 2019 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2019. Our Board previously approved 2018 and 2017 regular quarterly dividends of $0.02 per share, which were paid in March, June, September and December of 2018 and 2017. Dividend distributions in the future are subject to the availability of cash, limitations on cash dividends under our ABL Credit Facility and continuing determination by our Board of Directors that the payment of dividends remains in the best interest of our shareholders. Page 37 Stock Repurchase Program In 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 550,000 shares of the Company issued and outstanding common stock, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated stock repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, all or some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. Repurchased shares are held in our treasury, or canceled and retired as our Board may determine from time to time. Any repurchases of common stock are subject to the covenants contained in the ABL Credit Facility. Under the ABL Credit Facility, we may repurchase common stock and pay dividends up to $5.0 million in the aggregate during any trailing twelve months without restrictions. Purchases in excess of $5.0 million require us to (i) maintain availability in excess of 20.0% of the aggregate revolver commitments ($95.0 million at December 31, 2018) or (ii) to maintain availability equal to or greater than 15.0% of the aggregate revolver commitments ($71.3 million at December 31, 2018) and we must maintain a pro-forma ratio of EBITDA, minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to fixed charges of at least 1.00 to 1.00. The timing and amount of any repurchases under the stock repurchase program will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and limitations under ABL Credit Facility, and repurchases may be discontinued at any time. During 2019, we expect to be limited to the $5.0 million available without restrictions to repurchase common stock and pay dividends. There were no shares repurchased during 2018, 2017 or 2016. Debt Arrangements On November 30, 2018, we amended our ABL Credit Facility. The amendment increased the revolving credit facility by $75 million and now includes the assets acquired from McCullough on January 2, 2019. The ABL Credit Facility provides for, among other things: (i) a revolving credit facility of up to $445 million, including a $20 million sub-limit for letters of credit and (ii) a first in, last out revolving credit facility of up to $30 million. Under the terms of the ABL Credit Facility, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request additional commitments under the revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $200 million to the extent that existing or new lenders agree to provide such additional commitments. The ABL Credit Facility matures on December 8, 2022. The ABL Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our existing and future personal property. The ABL Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties and certain covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness (ii) pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock or redeem or repurchase subordinated debt (iii) make investments (iv) sell assets (v) enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries (vi) incur or suffer to exist liens securing indebtedness (vii) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and (viii) engage in transactions with affiliates. In addition, the ABL Credit Facility contains a financial covenant which includes: (i) if any commitments or obligations are outstanding and our availability is less than the greater of $30 million or 10.0% of the aggregate amount of revolver commitments ($47.5 million at December 31, 2018) or 10.0% of the aggregate borrowing base ($44.4 million at December 31, 2018) then we must maintain a ratio of EBITDA minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to fixed charges of at least 1.00 to 1.00 for the most recent twelve fiscal month period. We have the option to borrow under our revolver based on the agent base rate plus a premium ranging from 0.00% to 0.25% or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a premium ranging from 1.25% to 2.75%. As of December 31, 2018 we were in compliance with our covenants and had approximately $139.3 million of availability under the ABL Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018, $1.6 million of bank financing fees were included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other long-term assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The financing fees are being amortized over the five-year term of the ABL Credit Facility and are included in Interest and other expense on debt on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. On January 10, 2019, we entered into a five-year interest rate swap that locked the interest rate at 2.567% on $75 million of our revolving debt. As part of the CTI acquisition in July 2011, we assumed approximately $5.9 million of Industrial Revenue Bond (IRB) indebtedness. On March 1, 2018, we made the final $0.9 million payment on the IRB and the letter of credit and fixed interest rate swap associated with the IRB were terminated. Page 38 201 7 Compared to 201 6 Operating Activities During 2017, we used $19.0 million of cash for operations, of which $26.7 million was generated from operating activities and $45.7 million was used for working capital. During 2016, we used $9.8 million of cash for operations, of which $16.8 million was generated from operating activities and $26.6 million was used for working capital. Net cash generated from operations totaled $26.7 million during 2017 and was primarily comprised of net income of $18.9 million, depreciation and amortization of $18.6 million offset by the net change in long-term assets and liabilities of $11.9 million, which includes the $6.2 million tax benefit related to the Tax Act. Net cash generated from operations totaled $16.8 million during 2016 and was primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of $19.4 million offset by the net change in long-term assets and liabilities of $1.7 million and the net loss of $1.1 million. Working capital at December 31, 2017 totaled $310.0 million, a $50.0 million increase from December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to a $31.0 million increase in accounts receivable (resulting primarily from higher sales in 2017) and a $20.8 million increase in inventory (resulting from increased inventory levels throughout 2017), offset by a $4.6 million increase in accounts payable and outstanding checks (resulting from the increased inventory purchases at the end of 2017) and a $1.6 million increase in accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities. Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities was $9.2 million during 2017, compared to $6.4 million during 2016. In 2017, capital expenditures totaled $10.2 million and were primarily attributable to processing equipment, facilities expansions and facilities maintenance. Financing Activities In 2017, $28.9 million of cash was generated from financing activities, which primarily consisted of $31.6 million of net borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility, offset by $0.9 million of credit facility fees and expenses paid in connection with the ABL Credit Facility. In 2016, $17.0 million of cash was generated from financing activities which primarily consisted of $18.8 million of net borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility. Our Board previously approved 2017 and 2016 regular quarterly dividends of $0.02 per share, which were paid in March, June, September and December of 2017 and 2016.

(d) Primarily consists of retirement liabilities and deferred compensation payable in future years. (e) See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off - Balance Sheet Arrangements An off-balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (a) made guarantees, (b) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (c) any obligation under certain derivative instruments or (d) any obligation under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to a company, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services within a company. Other than operating leases, which are disclosed above, and derivative instruments discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2018, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements. Effects of Inflation Inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits, transportation services, processing equipment, purchased metals, energy and borrowings under our credit facility. General inflation, excluding increases in the price of metals and increased labor and distribution expense, has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years. Critical Accounting Policies This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On an on-going basis, we monitor and evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of short-term highly liquid investments, with a three-month or less maturity, which are readily convertible into cash. Page 40 Fair Market Value Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. To measure fair value, we apply a fair value hierarchy that is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and the credit facility revolver, are stated at their carrying value, which is a reasonable estimate of fair value. The fair value of marketable securities is based on quoted market prices. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable The allowance for doubtful accounts in maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified. Estimations are based upon the application of a historical collection rate to the outstanding accounts receivable balance, which remains fairly level from year to year, and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers, which can fluctuate significantly from year to year. We cannot be certain that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience. We consider all available information when assessing the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts each quarter. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of its cost or net realizable value. Inventory costs include the costs of the purchased metals, inbound freight, external and internal processing and applicable labor and overhead costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Costs of our carbon and specialty metals flat products segments inventories, including flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products are determined using the specific identification method. Certain of our tubular and pipe products inventory is stated under the LIFO method. At December 31, 2018, approximately $51.1 million, or 13.9% of consolidated inventory, was reported under the LIFO method of accounting. The cost of the remainder of tubular and pipe product segment inventory is determined using a weighted average rolling first-in, first-out method. On the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Cost of materials sold (exclusive of items shown separately below) consists of the cost of purchased metals, inbound and internal transfer freight, external processing costs, and LIFO income or expense. Property and Equipment, and Depreciation Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from two to 30 years. We capitalize the costs of obtaining or developing internal-use software, including directly related payroll costs. We amortize those costs over five years, beginning when the software is ready for its intended use. Page 41 Intangible Assets and Recoverability of Long-lived Assets The Company performs an annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant nonperformance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. Management uses judgment to determine whether to use a qualitative analysis or a quantitative fair value measurement for the reporting unit that carries intangible assets. If a quantitative fair value measurement is used, the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. We estimate the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow methodology. Management assumptions used for the calculations are based on historical results, projected financial information and recent economic events. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions which could adversely affect the reported value of intangible assets. We evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. We record an impairment or change in useful life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed. Income Taxes Deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet include, as an offset to the estimated temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts on the consolidated balance sheets, the tax effect of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. If we determine that we will not be able to fully realize a deferred tax asset, we will record a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax asset to its net realizable value. We recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in normal income tax expense. Penalties, if incurred, would be recognized as a component of administrative and general expense. Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers are comprised of purchase orders with standard terms and conditions. Occasionally we may also have longer-term agreements with customers. Substantially all of the contracts with customers require the delivery of metals which represent single performance obligations that are satisfied upon transfer of control of the product to the customer. Transfer of control is assessed based on the use of the product distributed and rights to payment for performance under the contract terms. Transfer of control and revenue recognition for substantially all of our sales occur upon shipment or delivery of the product, which is when title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer and is based on the applicable shipping terms. The shipping terms depend on the customer contract. An invoice for payment is issued at time of shipment and terms are generally net 30 days. We have certain fabrication contracts in one business unit for which revenue is recognized over time as performance obligations are achieved. This fabrication business is immaterial to our consolidated results. Sales returns and allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical experience and current estimates and are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs Amounts charged to customers for shipping and other transportation services are included in net sales. The distribution expense line on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income is entirely comprised of all shipping and other transportation costs incurred by us in shipping goods to its customers. Stock-Based Compensation We record compensation expense for stock awards issued to employees and directors. For additional information, see Note 11, Equity Plans. Page 42 Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In August, 2018, the Financial Account Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2018-15, Intangibles Goodwill and other Internal-use software: Customer accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract . This ASU aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). Accordingly, this ASU requires an entity (customer) in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract to follow the guidance in Subtopic 350-40 to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense. This ASU also requires the entity (customer) to expense the capitalized implementation costs of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract over the term of the hosting arrangement, which includes reasonably certain renewals. For public business entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We early adopted ASU 2018-15 in the third quarter of 2018 and the adoption of this ASU did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements. In August 2017, FASB issued ASU No 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging . This ASU aligns an entity risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. To meet that objective, this ASU expand and refine hedge accounting for both nonfinancial and financial risk components and align the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements. This ASU also make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance and ease the administrative burden of hedge documentation requirements and assessing hedge effectiveness. This ASU is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2016-310 , Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities , which has been deleted. For public business entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted in any interim period after issuance of this ASU. All transition requirements and elections should be applied to hedging relationships existing (that is, hedging relationships in which the hedging instrument has not expired, been sold, terminated, or exercised or the entity has not removed the designation of the hedging relationship) on the date of adoption. The effect of adoption should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to materially impact our consolidated financial statements. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No 2017-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718) . This ASU provides clarity and reduces both (1) diversity in practice and (2) cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. This ASU provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. This ASU is the final version of proposed Accounting Standards Update 2016-360, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Scope of Modification Accounting , which has been deleted. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this ASU did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which specifies the accounting for leases. The objective is to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease. This ASU introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2019. The adoption of the guidance will impact our Consolidated Balance Sheets by the creation of right to use assets and lease liabilities in the range of $22 million to $27 million. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our Statement of Comprehensive Income or on the Statement of Cash Flows. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2018. We completed the process of evaluating the effect of the adoption and determined there were no material changes required to the reported revenues as a result of the adoption. Substantially all of the revenue arrangements consist of a single performance obligation to transfer goods. Based on the evaluation process and review of the contracts with customers, the timing and amount of revenue recognized based on ASU 2015-14 is consistent with the revenue recognition policy under previous guidance. The adoption of this ASU on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standard in effect for those periods. The impact of adopting ASU 606 was not material to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. See Note 3, Revenue Recognition. Page 43
