Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The Company operates with a two-platform business model. Its regulated energy delivery platform and its construction materials and services platform are each comprised of different operating segments. Some of these segments experience seasonality related to the industries in which they operate. The two-platform approach helps balance this seasonality and the risk associated with each type of industry. Through its regulated energy delivery platform, the Company provides electric and natural gas services to customers, generates, transmits and distributes electricity, and provides natural gas transportation, storage and gathering services. These businesses are regulated by state public service commissions and/or the FERC. The construction materials and services platform provides construction services to a variety of industries, including commercial, industrial and governmental, and provides construction materials through aggregate mining and marketing of related products, such as ready-mixed concrete and asphalt. The Company is organized into five reportable business segments. These business segments include: electric, natural gas distribution, pipeline and midstream, construction materials and contracting, and construction services. The Company's business segments are determined based on the Company's method of internal reporting, which generally segregates the strategic business units due to differences in products, services and regulation. The internal reporting of these segments is defined based on the reporting and review process used by the Company's chief executive officer. The Company's strategy is to apply its expertise in the regulated energy delivery and construction materials and services businesses to increase market share, increase profitability and enhance shareholder value through organic growth opportunities and strategic acquisitions. The Company is focused on a disciplined approach to the acquisition of well-managed companies and properties. The Company has capabilities to fund its growth and operations through various sources, including internally generated funds, commercial paper facilities, revolving credit facilities and the issuance from time to time of debt and equity securities. For more information on the Company's capital expenditures, see Liquidity and Capital Commitments. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the TCJA making significant changes to the United States federal income tax laws. Some of the more material changes from the TCJA that impacted the Company were reduced corporate tax rates, repeal of the domestic production deduction and disallowance of immediate expensing for regulated utility property. The Company has reviewed the impacts of the TCJA and is complying with all known tax rules and guidance. For additional information on the impacts of the TCJA, see Item 8 - Note 13 . Consolidated Earnings Overview The following table summarizes the contribution to the consolidated earnings by each of the Company's business segments. Years ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In millions, except per share amounts) Electric $ 47.0 $ 49.4 $ 42.2 Natural gas distribution 37.7 32.2 27.1 Pipeline and midstream 28.5 20.5 23.4 Construction materials and contracting 92.6 123.4 102.7 Construction services 64.3 53.3 33.9 Other (.7 ) (1.5 ) (3.2 ) Intersegment eliminations 6.9 6.3 Earnings before discontinued operations 269.4 284.2 232.4 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 2.9 (3.8 ) (300.4 ) Loss from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest (131.7 ) Earnings on common stock $ 272.3 $ 280.4 $ 63.7 Earnings per common share - basic: Earnings before discontinued operations $ 1.38 $ 1.46 $ 1.19 Discontinued operations attributable to the Company, net of tax .01 (.02 ) (.86 ) Earnings per common share - basic $ 1.39 $ 1.44 $ .33 Earnings per common share - diluted: Earnings before discontinued operations $ 1.38 $ 1.45 $ 1.19 Discontinued operations attributable to the Company, net of tax .01 (.02 ) (.86 ) Earnings per common share - diluted $ 1.39 $ 1.43 $ .33 32 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II 2018 compared to 2017 The Company's consolidated earnings decreased $8.1 million. The Company's earnings were positively impacted in 2018 as a result of the lower federal statutory tax rate, which was partially offset by the absence of a $39.5 million tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the revaluation of the business's net deferred tax liabilities. Both tax impacts were the result of the enactment of the TCJA, as further discussed in Item 8 - Note 13 . Decreased earnings due to lower returns on investments also offset the lower income tax rate. Also positively impacting the Company's earnings were higher outside specialty contracting gross margins due to increased outside equipment sales and rentals at the construction services business, as well as a $4.2 million income tax benefit relating to the reversal of a regulatory liability recorded in 2017 based on a FERC final accounting order issued during the third quarter of 2018 at the pipeline and midstream business. 2017 compared to 2016 The Company's consolidated earnings increased $216.7 million. The Company's earnings were positively impacted due to the absence in 2017 of a loss associated with the sale of the refining business in June 2016 relating to discontinued operations, as well as an overall income tax benefit to the Company of $39.5 million primarily for the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax liabilities. Also contributing to the Company's increased earnings were higher inside and outside specialty contracting margins driven by decreased costs and higher contracting workloads at the construction services business, higher natural gas retail sales margins as a result of increased retail sales volumes at the natural gas distribution business and higher electric retail sales margins at the electric business. These increases were partially offset by lower asphalt product and construction margins driven by competitive pricing and unfavorable weather at the construction materials and contracting business and lower gathering and processing revenues resulting from lower volumes due to the sale of the Pronghorn assets in January 2017 at the pipeline and midstream business. A discussion of key financial data from the Company's business segments follows. Business Segment Financial and Operating Data Following are key financial and operating data for each of the Company's business segments. Also included are highlights on key growth strategies, projections and certain assumptions for the Company and its subsidiaries and other matters of the Company's business segments. Many of these highlighted points are "forward-looking statements." For more information, see Part I - Forward-Looking Statements. There is no assurance that the Company's projections, including estimates for growth and changes in earnings, will in fact be achieved. Please refer to assumptions contained in this section, as well as the various important factors listed in Item 1A - Risk Factors. Changes in such assumptions and factors could cause actual future results to differ materially from the Company's growth and earnings projections. For information pertinent to various commitments and contingencies, see Item 8 - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a summary of the Company's business segments, see Item 8 - Note 15 . Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Strategy and challenges The electric and natural gas distribution segments provide electric and natural gas distribution services to customers, as discussed in Items 1 and 2 - Business Properties. Both segments strive to be a top performing utility company measured by integrity, safety, employee satisfaction, customer service and shareholder return, while continuing to focus on providing safe, reliable and competitively priced energy and related services to customers. The Company continues to monitor opportunities for these segments to retain, grow and expand their customer base through extensions of existing operations, including building and upgrading electric generation, transmission and distribution and natural gas systems, and through selected acquisitions of companies and properties at prices that will provide stable cash flows and an opportunity to earn a competitive return on investment. The continued efforts to create operational improvements and efficiencies across both segments promotes the Company's business integration strategy. The primary factors that impact the results of these segments are the ability to earn authorized rates of return, the cost of natural gas, cost of electric fuel and purchased power, weather, competitive factors in the energy industry, population growth and economic conditions in the segments' service areas. The electric and natural gas distribution segments are subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions where they conduct operations with respect to costs, timely recovery of investments and permitted returns on investment, as well as certain operational, system integrity and environmental regulations. To assist in the reduction of regulatory lag with the increase in investments, tracking mechanisms have been implemented in certain jurisdictions. Legislative and regulatory initiatives to increase renewable energy resources and reduce GHG emissions could impact the price and demand for electricity and natural gas and result in the retirement of certain electric generating facilities before they are fully depreciated. Although the current administration has slowed environmental regulations, the segments continue to invest in facility upgrades to be in compliance with the existing and future regulations. Tariff increases on steel and aluminum materials could negatively affect the segments' construction projects and maintenance work. The Company continues to monitor the impact tariff increases will have on raw material costs. The natural gas distribution segment is also facing MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 33 Part II increased lead times on delivery of certain raw materials used in pipeline projects. In addition to the effect of tariffs, long lead times are attributable to increased demand for steel products from pipeline companies as they respond to the United States Department of Transportation Pipeline System Safety and Integrity Plan. The Company continues to monitor the material lead times and is working with manufacturers to proactively order such materials to help mitigate the extended lead times. The ability to grow through acquisitions is subject to significant competition and acquisition premiums. In addition, the ability of the segments to grow their service territory and customer base is affected by the economic environment of the markets served and competition from other energy providers and fuels. The construction of any new electric generating facilities, transmission lines and other service facilities is subject to increasing cost and lead time, extensive permitting procedures, and federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives, which will likely necessitate increases in electric energy prices. Revenues are impacted by both customer growth and usage, the latter of which is primarily impacted by weather. Very cold winters increase demand for natural gas and to a lesser extent, electricity, while warmer than normal summers increase demand for electricity, especially among residential and commercial customers. Average consumption among natural gas customers has tended to decline as more efficient appliances and furnaces are installed, and as the Company has implemented conservation programs. Natural gas decoupling mechanisms in certain jurisdictions have been implemented to largely mitigate the effect that would otherwise be caused by variations in volumes sold to these customers due to weather and changing consumption patterns on the Company's distribution margins. Earnings overview - The following information summarizes the performance of the electric segment. Years ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (Dollars in millions, where applicable) Operating revenues $ 335.1 $ 342.8 $ 322.3 Electric fuel and purchased power 80.7 78.7 75.5 Taxes, other than income .7 .8 .6 Adjusted gross margin 253.7 263.3 246.2 Operating expenses: Operation and maintenance 123.0 122.2 115.8 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 51.0 47.7 50.2 Taxes, other than income 14.5 13.5 12.3 Total operating expenses 188.5 183.4 178.3 Operating income 65.2 79.9 67.9 Other income 1.2 3.2 1.3 Interest expense 25.9 25.4 25.0 Income before income taxes 40.5 57.7 44.2 Income taxes (6.5 ) 7.7 1.4 Net income 47.0 50.0 42.8 Loss/dividends on preferred stock .6 .6 Earnings $ 47.0 $ 49.4 $ 42.2 Retail sales (million kWh): Residential 1,196.6 1,153.5 1,132.5 Commercial 1,513.9 1,513.1 1,491.8 Industrial 551.0 539.9 544.2 Other 92.9 100.0 90.0 3,354.4 3,306.5 3,258.5 Average cost of electric fuel and purchased power per kWh $ .022 $ .022 $ .021 Adjusted gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information and reconciliation of the non-GAAP adjusted gross margin attributable to the electric segment, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section later in this Item. 2018 compared to 2017 Electric earnings decreased $2.4 million ( 5 percent) as a result of: Adjusted gross margin: Decrease of $9.6 million, primarily due to lower operating revenues driven by the reserves against revenues in certain jurisdictions for anticipated refunds to customers for lower income taxes due to the enactment of TCJA and a transmission formula rate adjustment due to lower than anticipated project costs on the BSSE project recorded in the third quarter of 2018. Partially offsetting the decreases to adjusted gross margin were the absence in 2018 of reserves related to tracker balances in prior years and increased 34 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II retail sales volumes of 1 percent to all major customer classes. Operation and maintenance: Increase of $800,000, largely from higher contract services at certain generating stations. Partially offsetting the increase were lower payroll-related costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Increase of $3.3 million as a result of increased plant balances. Taxes, other than income: Increase of $1.0 million, primarily from higher property taxes in certain jurisdictions. Other income: Decrease of $2.0 million, largely the result of lower returns on investments. Interest expense: Comparable to the prior year. Income taxes: Decrease of $14.2 million, largely due to the enactment of the TCJA reduced corporate tax rate, reduced income before income taxes and the absence of $2.1 million of income tax expense in 2018 for the revaluation of nonutility net deferred tax assets in 2017, as discussed in Item 8 - Note 13 . Partially offsetting these decreases were lower production tax credits. A portion of the reduction in income taxes are being reserved against revenues, as previously discussed, resulting in a minimal impact on overall earnings. 2017 compared to 2016 Electric earnings increased $7.2 million (17 percent) as a result of: Adjusted gross margin: Increase of $17.1 million, primarily from increased electric retail sales margins from the recovery of an additional investment on the BSSE project, approved rate recovery in all jurisdictions and 2 percent higher retail sales volumes to commercial and residential customers. Operation and maintenance: Increase of $6.4 million, largely from higher payroll-related costs, material costs and contract services at certain generating stations. Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Decrease of $2.5 million, largely from lower depreciation rates implemented in conjunction with regulatory recovery activity. Taxes, other than income: Increase of $1.2 million, primarily from higher property taxes in certain jurisdictions. Other income: Increase of $1.9 million, largely the result of higher returns on investments. Interest expense: Comparable to the prior year. Income taxes: Increase of $6.3 million, largely from increased income before income taxes and $2.1 million of income tax expense for the revaluation of nonutility net deferred tax assets, as discussed in Item 8 - Note 13 . MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 35 Part II Earnings overview - The following information summarizes the performance of the natural gas distribution segment. Years ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (Dollars in millions, where applicable) Operating revenues $ 823.2 $ 848.4 $ 766.1 Purchased natural gas sold 454.8 479.9 431.5 Taxes, other than income 28.5 30.0 26.5 Adjusted gross margin 339.9 338.5 308.1 Operating expenses: Operation and maintenance 173.4 164.3 156.9 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 72.5 69.4 65.4 Taxes, other than income 21.7 20.5 19.6 Total operating expenses 267.6 254.2 241.9 Operating income 72.3 84.3 66.2 Other income .2 2.0 .6 Interest expense 30.7 31.2 30.4 Income before income taxes 41.8 55.1 36.4 Income taxes 4.1 22.8 9.2 Net income 37.7 32.3 27.2 Loss/dividends on preferred stock .1 .1 Earnings $ 37.7 $ 32.2 $ 27.1 Volumes (MMdk) Retail sales: Residential 63.7 63.6 56.2 Commercial 44.4 44.3 38.9 Industrial 4.5 4.6 4.2 112.6 112.5 99.3 Transportation sales: Commercial 2.2 2.0 1.8 Industrial 147.3 142.5 145.8 149.5 144.5 147.6 Total throughput 262.1 257.0 246.9 Average cost of natural gas, including transportation, per dk $ 4.04 $ 4.26 $ 4.35 Adjusted gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information and reconciliation of the non-GAAP adjusted gross margin attributable to the natural gas distribution segment, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section later in this Item. 2018 compared to 2017 Natural gas distribution earnings increased $5.5 million ( 17 percent) as a result of: Adjusted gross margin: Increase of $1.4 million, primarily due to increased retail sales margins, mainly the result of weather normalization mechanisms in certain jurisdictions and conservation revenue, which offsets the conservation expense in operation and maintenance expense. Also contributing to the retail sales margin increase were higher basic service charges as a result of increased retail sales customers and rate design. These increases were partially offset by tax reform revenue impacts for refunds to customers as a result of lower income taxes due to the enactment of TCJA and lower volumes in certain jurisdictions. Operation and maintenance: Increase of $9.1 million, largely related to conservation expenses being recovered in revenue; contract services, which includes the recognition of a non-recurring expense related to the approved WUTC general rate case settlement in the second quarter 2018; and higher payroll-related costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Increase of $3.1 million, primarily as a result of increased plant balances offset in part by lower depreciation rates implemented in certain jurisdictions. Taxes, other than income: Increase of $1.2 million due to higher property taxes in certain jurisdictions. Other income: Decrease of $1.8 million, primarily the result of lower returns on investments. Interest expense: Comparable to the prior year. Income taxes: Decrease of $18.7 million, largely due to the enactment of the TCJA reduced corporate tax rate, as well as the absence of $4.3 million income tax expense related to the 2017 revaluation of nonutility net deferred tax assets, as discussed in Item 8 - Note 13 , 36 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II and reduced income before income taxes. A portion of the reduction in income taxes are being reserved against revenues or passed back to customers, as previously discussed, resulting in a minimal impact on overall earnings. 2017 compared to 2016 Natural gas distribution earnings increased $5.1 million (19 percent) as a result of: Adjusted gross margin: Increase of $30.4 million, primarily due to increased retail sales margins as a result of increased retail sales volumes of 13 percent across all customer classes from colder weather in all jurisdictions, offset in part by weather normalization in certain jurisdictions and 2 percent customer growth. Also contributing to the increases were approved final and interim rate increases. Operation and maintenance: Increase of $7.4 million, primarily from increased payroll-related costs and material costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Increase of $4.0 million as a result of increased plant balances. Taxes, other than income: Increase of $900,000 due to higher property taxes in certain jurisdictions. Other income: Increase of $1.4 million as a result of higher returns on investments. Interest expense: Increase of $800,000 due to increased debt balances. Income taxes: Increase of $13.6 million, largely the result of increased income before income taxes, as well as an additional $4.3 million income tax expense for the revaluation of nonutility net deferred tax assets, as discussed in Item 8 - Note 13 . Outlook The Company expects these segments will grow rate base by approximately 5 percent annually over the next five years on a compound basis. This growth projection is on a much larger base, having grown rate base at a record pace of 12 percent compounded annually over the past five-year period. Operations are spread across eight states where the Company expects customer growth to be higher than the national average. The Company expects its customer base to grow by 1 percent to 2 percent per year. This customer growth, along with system upgrades and replacements needed to supply safe and reliable service, will require investments in new electric generation and transmission and natural gas systems. In November 2017, the NDPSC approved the advance determination of prudence for the purchase of the Thunder Spirit Wind farm expansion in southwest North Dakota. Construction of the Thunder Spirit Wind farm expansion began in May 2018 and on October 31, 2018, the Company finalized the purchase and placed it into service. With the addition of the expansion, the total Thunder Spirit Wind farm generation capacity is approximately 155 MW and increased the Company's electric generation portfolio to approximately 27 percent renewables based on nameplate ratings. The Company's integrated resource plans filed in North Dakota and Montana in 2017 include additional generation projects in the 2025 timeframe. In June 2016, the Company, along with a partner, began construction on the BSSE project. The estimated capital investment for this project has been updated to approximately $130 million. All necessary easements have been secured and construction is complete. The Company began bringing the project on-line on February 5, 2019 . In addition, the Company is also expecting to receive a continuation of the return on the project throughout the year. On February 19, 2019, the Company announced that it intends to retire three aging coal-fired electric generation units within the next three years due to the fact that the plants are no longer expected to be cost competitive. The retirements are expected to be in late 2020 for Lewis & Clark station in Sidney, Montana, and in late 2021 for units 1 and 2 at Heskett station in Mandan, North Dakota. These dates may be impacted by the Company's coal supplier's pending bankruptcy proceeding. In addition, the Company announced that it intends to construct a new simple-cycle natural gas combustion turbine peaking unit at the existing plant site in Mandan, North Dakota. The Company continues to be focused on the regulatory recovery of its investments. Since January 1, 2018, these segments have implemented rate increases, as well as system integrity mechanisms, in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Washington and before the FERC. The Company files for rate adjustments to seek recovery of operating costs and capital investments, as well as reasonable returns as allowed by regulators. The Company's most recent cases by jurisdiction are discussed in Item 8 - Note 18 . With the enactment of the TCJA, the state regulators in jurisdictions where the segments operate requested companies submit plans for the estimated impact of the TCJA. The segments determined the use of the deferral method of accounting for the revaluation of its regulated deferred tax assets and liabilities was appropriate. As such, the Company recorded a regulatory liability for the excess deferred income taxes that related to the effect of the change in tax rates on its regulated deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Company reserved an additional regulatory liability of approximately $18.5 million, which is an offset to the Company's revenues, as previously discussed. The additional reserves were calculated by completing a revenue requirement calculation in each state where the Company thought it was probable that the refund of tax savings would be returned to the Company's customers, or based on calculations or amounts prescribed by the commissions. The Company has been working on various rate cases with the state regulators relating to the impacts of the TCJA. A majority of these rate cases have been settled with new rates being implemented in 2018 or upcoming in 2019. For further details on the status of implementing the new rates, as well as the status on open rate cases, see MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 37 Part II Item 8 - Note 18 . Due to not being able to immediately expense utility property for tax purposes, the segments' cash flows are negatively impacted. Pipeline and Midstream Strategy and challenges The pipeline and midstream segment provides natural gas transportation, gathering and underground storage services, as discussed in Items 1 and 2 - Business Properties. The segment focuses on utilizing its extensive expertise in the design, construction and operation of energy infrastructure and related services to increase market share and profitability through optimization of existing operations, organic growth and investments in energy-related assets within or in close proximity to its current operating areas. The segment focuses on the continual safety and reliability of its systems, which entails building and maintaining safe natural gas pipelines and facilities. The segment continues to evaluate growth opportunities including the expansion of existing storage, gathering and transmission facilities; incremental pipeline projects to expand pipeline capacity; and expansion of energy-related services leveraging on its core competencies. The segment is exposed to energy price volatility which is impacted by the fluctuations in pricing, production and basis differentials of the energy market's commodities. Legislative and regulatory initiatives to increase pipeline safety regulations and reduce methane emissions could also impact the price and demand for natural gas. Tariff increases on steel and aluminum materials could negatively affect the segment's construction projects and maintenance work. The Company continues to monitor the impact tariff increases will have on raw material costs. The segment experiences extended lead times on raw materials that are critical to the segment's construction and maintenance work. Long lead times on materials could delay maintenance work and project construction potentially causing lost revenues and/or increased costs. The Company continues to proactively monitor and plan for the material lead times, as well as work with manufacturers and suppliers to help mitigate the extended lead times. The pipeline and midstream segment is subject to extensive regulation including certain operational, system integrity and environmental regulations, as well as various permit terms and operational compliance conditions. The segment is charged with the ongoing process of reviewing existing permits and easements, as well as securing new permits and easements as necessary to meet current demand and future growth opportunities. Exposure to pipeline opposition groups could also cause negative impacts on the segment with increased costs and potential delays to project completion. The segment focuses on the recruitment and retention of a skilled workforce to remain competitive and provide services to its customers. The industry in which it operates relies on a skilled workforce to construct energy infrastructure and operate existing infrastructure in a safe manner. A shortage of skilled personnel can create a competitive labor market which could increase costs incurred by the segment. Competition from other pipeline and midstream companies can also have a negative impact on the segment. 38 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II Earnings overview - The following information summarizes the performance of the pipeline and midstream segment. Years ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (Dollars in millions) Operating revenues $ 128.9 $ 122.2 $ 141.6 Operating expenses: Operation and maintenance 62.2 56.9 61.9 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 17.9 16.8 24.9 Taxes, other than income 12.7 12.5 11.9 Total operating expenses 92.8 86.2 98.7 Operating income 36.1 36.0 42.9 Other income 1.0 1.8 .9 Interest expense 5.9 5.0 8.0 Income before income taxes 31.2 32.8 35.8 Income taxes 2.7 12.3 12.4 Earnings $ 28.5 $ 20.5 $ 23.4 Transportation volumes (MMdk) 351.5 312.5 285.3 Natural gas gathering volumes (MMdk) 14.9 16.1 20.0 Customer natural gas storage balance (MMdk): Beginning of period 22.4 26.4 16.6 Net injection (withdrawal) (8.5 ) (4.0 ) 9.8 End of period 13.9 22.4 26.4 2018 compared to 2017 Pipeline and midstream earnings increased $8.0 million ( 39 percent) as a result of: Revenues: Increase of $6.7 million, largely attributable to increased volumes of natural gas transported through its system as a result of completed organic growth projects and higher nonregulated project workloads, which increased revenues $4.1 million. These increases were partially offset by decreased storage-related revenues reflecting the decrease in natural gas pricing spreads, as discussed in the Outlook section. Operation and maintenance: Increase of $5.3 million, primarily from higher nonregulated project costs of $3.9 million directly related to the increase in nonregulated project workloads, as previously discussed, as well as higher professional services, material costs and contract services. Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Increase of $1.1 million, largely resulting from organic growth projects. Taxes, other than income: Comparable to the prior year. Other income: Decrease of $800,000, primarily the result of lower returns on investments partially offset by higher AFUDC. Interest expense: Increase of $900,000, largely resulting from higher debt balances. Income taxes: Decrease of $9.6 million, primarily resulting from the lower corporate tax rate due to the enactment of the TCJA creating a reduction to income tax expense, as well as the realization of a $4.2 million income tax benefit related to the reversal of a regulatory liability recorded in 2017 based on a FERC final accounting order issued during third quarter of 2018. 2017 compared to 2016 Pipeline and midstream earnings decreased $2.9 million (13 percent) as a result of: Revenues: Decrease of $19.4 million, largely resulting from lower gathering and processing revenues of $22.6 million. The decrease in revenues resulted from lower volumes from the sale of the Pronghorn assets in January 2017. Partially offsetting the decrease was higher transportation revenues of $1.6 million, largely from increased off-system transportation volumes due to organic growth projects completed in 2017. Operation and maintenance: Decrease of $5.0 million, which includes $3.6 million primarily from the absence of Pronghorn, as previously discussed, and the absence in 2017 of a fair value impairment in 2016 associated with the Pronghorn sale. Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Decrease of $8.1 million, largely due to the absence of the Pronghorn assets, as previously discussed. Taxes, other than income: Increase of $600,000 from higher property taxes. Other income: Increase of $900,000 attributable to higher AFUDC. MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 39 Part II Interest expense: Decrease of $3.0 million due to lower debt balances. Income taxes: Comparable to the prior year. Outlook The Company has continued to experience the effects of natural gas production at record levels, which has provided opportunities for organic growth projects and increased demand. The completion of organic growth projects has contributed to the Company transporting increasing volumes of natural gas through its system. Additionally, the record levels of natural gas supply have moderated the need for storage services and put downward pressure on natural gas prices and minimized pricing volatility. Both natural gas production levels and pressure on natural gas prices are expected to continue in the near term. The Company continues to focus on growth and improving existing operations through organic projects in all areas in which it operates. The following describes recent growth projects. In January 2019, the Company announced plans to construct approximately 67 miles of new pipeline, compression and ancillary facilities to transport natural gas from core Bakken production areas near Tioga, North Dakota, and extend to a new interconnection point in McKenzie County, North Dakota. This North Bakken Expansion project, as designed, would provide 200 MMcf per day of natural gas transportation capacity. Construction is expected to begin in early 2021 with an estimated completion date late in 2021, which is dependent on regulatory and environmental permitting and finalization of transportation agreements with customers. The estimated cost of the project is approximately $220 million. In November 2018, the Company completed construction and placed into service its Valley Expansion project, a 38-mile pipeline that delivers natural gas supply to eastern North Dakota and far western Minnesota. The project, which is designed to transport 40 MMcf of natural gas per day, is under the jurisdiction of the FERC. In September 2018, the Company completed construction and placed into service its Line Section 27 Expansion project in the Bakken area of northwestern North Dakota. The project includes approximately 13 miles of new pipeline and associated facilities and increases capacity by over 200 MMcf per day. The project brings the total capacity of Line Section 27 to over 600 MMcf per day. In early 2018, the Company announced two additional natural gas pipeline growth projects, the Demicks Lake project and Line Section 22 Expansion project. The Company has signed long-term commitment contracts supporting both projects. The Demicks Lake project, which includes approximately 14 miles of 20-inch pipe and will increase capacity by 175 MMcf per day, is located in McKenzie County, North Dakota. Construction is expected to begin in 2019, with an in-service date in the fall of 2019. The Line Section 22 Expansion project in the Billings, Montana, area is also scheduled to begin construction in 2019, with an expected in-service date in late 2019. This project will increase capacity by 22.5 MMcf per day to serve incremental demand in Billings, Montana. Construction Materials and Contracting Strategy and challenges The construction materials and contracting segment provides an integrated set of construction services, as discussed in Items 1 and 2 - Business Properties. The segment focuses on high-growth strategic markets located near major transportation corridors and desirable mid-sized metropolitan areas; strengthening the long-term, strategic aggregate reserve position through available purchase and/or lease opportunities; enhancing profitability through cost containment, margin discipline and vertical integration of the segment's operations; development and recruitment of talented employees; and continued growth through organic and acquisition opportunities. A key element of the Company's long-term strategy for this business is to further expand its market presence in the higher-margin materials business (rock, sand, gravel, liquid asphalt, asphalt concrete, ready-mixed concrete and related products), complementing and expanding on the segment's expertise. The Company's acquisitions in 2018 support this strategy. As one of the country's largest sand and gravel producers, the segment continues to strategically manage its 1.0 billion tons of aggregate reserves in all its markets, as well as take further advantage of being vertically integrated. The segment's vertical integration allows the segment to manage operations from aggregate mining to final lay-down of concrete and asphalt, with control of and access to permitted aggregate reserves being significant. The Company's aggregate reserves are naturally declining and as a result, the Company seeks acquisition opportunities to replace the reserves. In 2018, the Company's aggregate reserves increased by nearly 50 million tons primarily due to acquisition activity. The construction materials and contracting segment faces challenges that are not under the direct control of the business. The segment operates in geographically diverse and highly competitive markets. Competition can put negative pressure on the segment's operating margins. The segment is also subject to volatility in the cost of raw materials such as diesel fuel, gasoline, liquid asphalt, cement and steel. Although it is difficult to determine the split between inflation and supply/demand increases, diesel fuel costs remained fairly stable for the past twelve months, while asphalt oil costs have trended higher in 2018 as compared to 2017. Such volatility can have a negative impact on the segment's margins. Other variables that can impact the segment's margins include adverse weather conditions, the timing of project 40 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II starts or completion and declines or delays in new and existing projects due to the cyclical nature of the construction industry and federal infrastructure spending. The segment also faces challenges in the recruitment and retention of employees. Trends in the labor market include an aging workforce and availability issues. The segment continues to face increasing pressure to control costs, as well as find and train a skilled workforce to meet the needs of increasing demand and seasonal work. Earnings overview - The following information summarizes the performance of the construction materials and contracting segment. Years ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (Dollars in millions) Operating revenues $ 1,925.9 $ 1,812.5 $ 1,874.3 Cost of sales: Operation and maintenance 1,601.7 1,500.1 1,533.2 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 59.0 52.5 54.1 Taxes, other than income 39.7 38.0 37.5 Total cost of sales 1,700.4 1,590.6 1,624.8 Gross margin 225.5 221.9 249.5 Selling, general and administrative expense: Operation and maintenance 77.6 71.5 62.2 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.2 3.4 4.3 Taxes, other than income 4.3 3.8 4.3 Total selling, general and administrative expense 84.1 78.7 70.8 Operating income 141.4 143.2 178.7 Other income (expense) (3.1 ) .4 (.1 ) Interest expense 17.3 14.8 15.3 Income before income taxes 121.0 128.8 163.3 Income taxes 28.4 5.4 60.6 Earnings $ 92.6 $ 123.4 $ 102.7 Sales (000's): Aggregates (tons) 29,795 28,213 27,580 Asphalt (tons) 6,838 6,237 7,203 Ready-mixed concrete (cubic yards) 3,518 3,548 3,655 2018 compared to 2017 Construction materials and contracting's earnings decreased $30.8 million ( 25 percent) as a result of: Revenues: Increase of $113.4 million driven by higher asphalt product and aggregate volumes due to increased agency demand, increased realized prices and lower material costs. Partially offsetting these increases were lower ready-mixed concrete volumes due to a decrease in available work and unfavorable weather conditions in certain regions. Gross margin: Increase of $3.6 million resulting from higher asphalt product volumes and margins, largely from recent acquisitions and higher realized prices. Also contributing to the increase were higher aggregate volumes and margins due to strong market demand and lower material costs. Partially offsetting these increases were lower ready-mixed concrete volumes and margins due to a decrease in available work and unfavorable weather conditions in certain regions. Selling, general and administrative expense: Increase of $5.4 million, primarily payroll-related costs, acquisition costs and higher insurance-related costs. Other income: Decrease of $3.5 million, largely the result of lower returns on investments. Interest expense: Increase of $2.5 million, largely resulting from higher debt balances as a result of recent acquisitions, capital expenditures and higher working capital needs. Income taxes: Increase of $23.0 million, primarily resulting from the absence in 2018 of a $41.9 million tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the revaluation of the segment's net deferred tax liabilities, as discussed in Item 8 - Note 13 . Partially offsetting this increase were lower income taxes due to the enactment of the TCJA, which reduced the corporate tax rate. 2017 compared to 2016 Construction materials and contracting's earnings increased $20.7 million (20 percent) as a result of: Revenues: Decrease of $61.8 million resulting from lower asphalt product volumes driven by competitive pricing and unfavorable weather MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 41 Part II during the first half of the year, less available work and increased competition in certain regions. Gross margin: Decrease of $27.6 million, largely resulting from lower asphalt product margins, as previously discussed, and lower construction margins of $8.8 million driven by decreased workloads caused by unfavorable weather during the first half of the year and less available work in energy-producing states. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher aggregate margins of $8.0 million, primarily due to strong commercial and residential demand in certain regions. Selling, general and administrative expense: Increase of $7.9 million, largely resulting from the absence in 2017 of an $11.1 million reduction to a MEPP withdrawal liability. Partially offsetting the increase were lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and lower office expense. Other income: Comparable to the prior year. Interest expense: Comparable to the prior year. Income taxes: Decrease of $55.2 million, largely resulting from an income tax benefit of $41.9 million for the revaluation of the segment's net deferred tax liabilities, as discussed in Item 8 - Note 13 , and lower income before income taxes. Outlook The segment's vertically integrated aggregates based business model provides the Company with the ability to capture margin throughout the sales delivery process. The aggregate products are sold internally and externally for use in other products such as ready-mixed concrete, asphaltic concrete and public and private construction markets. The contracting services and construction materials are sold primarily to construction contractors in connection with street, highway and other public infrastructure projects, as well as private commercial and residential development projects. The public infrastructure projects have traditionally been more stable markets as public funding is more secure during periods of economic decline. The public funding is, however, dependent on federal funding such as appropriations to the Federal Highway Administration. Spending on private development is highly dependent on both local and national economic cycles, providing additional sales during times of strong economic cycles. The Company remains optimistic about overall economic growth and infrastructure spending. The IBISWorld Incorporated Industry Report issued in May 2018 for sand and gravel mining in the United States projects a 1.8 percent annual growth rate over the next five years. The report also states the demand for clay and refractory materials is projected to continue deteriorating in several downstream manufacturing industries, but this decline will be offset by stronger demand from the housing market and buoyant demand from the highway and bridge construction market. The Company believes stronger demand in the housing markets along with continued demand from the highway and bridge construction markets should provide a stable demand for construction materials and contracting products and services in the near future. In April 2018, t he Company acquired Teevin & Fischer Quarry, LLC, a crushed rock and gravel supplier in northwestern Oregon. In June 2018, the Company acquired Tri-City Paving, Inc., a general contractor and aggregate, asphalt and ready-mixed concrete supplier headquartered in Little Falls, Minnesota. In July 2018, the Company acquired Molalla Redi-Mix and Rock Products, Inc., which produces ready-mixed concrete in Molalla, Oregon. In October 2018, the Company acquired Sweetman Construction Company, a premier provider of aggregates, asphalt and ready-mixed concrete in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. These acquisitions are expected to be accretive to the segment's earnings in 2019. The Company continues to evaluate additional acquisition opportunities. For more information on these acquisitions, see Item 8 - Note 3 . The Company had backlog at December 31, 2018 , of $706 million , up from $486 million at December 31, 2017 . The Company has benefited from increased bidding opportunities in each of its regions. The increase in backlog was primarily attributable to work for state transportation departments, airports, the military, homebuilders and commercial developers. The Company expects to complete a significant amount of the backlog at December 31, 2018 , during the next 12 months. Construction Services Strategy and challenges The construction services segment provides inside and outside specialty contracting, as discussed in Items 1 and 2 - Business Properties. The construction services segment focuses on providing a superior return on investment by building new and strengthening existing customer relationships; ensuring quality service; safely executing projects; effectively controlling costs; collecting on receivables; retaining, developing and recruiting talented employees; growing through organic and acquisition opportunities; and focusing efforts on projects that will permit higher margins while properly managing risk. The construction services segment faces challenges in the highly competitive markets in which it operates. Competitive pricing environments, project delays and effects from restrictive regulatory requirements have negatively impacted margins in the past and could affect margins in the future. Additionally, margins may be negatively impacted on a quarterly basis due to adverse weather conditions, as well as timing of project starts or completions, declines or delays in new projects due to the cyclical nature of the construction industry and other factors. These challenges may also impact the risk of loss on certain projects. Accordingly, operating results in any particular period may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other period. 42 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II The need to ensure available specialized labor resources for projects also drives strategic relationships with customers and project margins. These trends include an aging workforce and labor availability issues, increasing pressure to reduce costs and improve reliability, and increasing duration and complexity of customer capital programs. Due to these and other factors, the Company believes customer demand for labor resources will continue to increase, possibly surpassing the supply of industry resources. Earnings overview - The following information summarizes the performance of the construction services segment. Years ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Operating revenues $ 1,371.5 $ 1,367.6 $ 1,073.3 Cost of sales: Operation and maintenance 1,150.4 1,153.9 905.4 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 14.3 14.2 13.5 Taxes, other than income 42.0 43.4 35.2 Total cost of sales 1,206.7 1,211.5 954.1 Gross margin 164.8 156.1 119.2 Selling, general and administrative expense: Operation and maintenance 72.2 69.3 60.1 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1.4 1.5 1.8 Taxes, other than income 4.4 4.0 3.8 Total selling, general and administrative expense 78.0 74.8 65.7 Operating income 86.8 81.3 53.5 Other income 1.1 1.3 2.2 Interest expense 3.6 3.7 4.0 Income before income taxes 84.3 78.9 51.7 Income taxes 20.0 25.6 17.8 Earnings $ 64.3 $ 53.3 $ 33.9 2018 compared to 2017 Construction services earnings increased $11.0 million ( 21 percent) as a result of: Revenues: Comparable to the prior year. Gross margin: Increase of $8.7 million, largely resulting from higher outside specialty contracting gross margins due to increased outside equipment sales and rentals. Partially offsetting the increase were decreased inside specialty contracting gross margins as a result of decreased workloads and customer demand. Selling, general and administrative expense: Increase of $3.2 million, primarily higher office expense, outside professional costs and payroll-related costs. Other income: Comparable to the prior year. Interest expense: Comparable to the prior year. Income taxes: Decrease of $5.6 million, largely the lower corporate tax rate due to the enactment of the TCJA. 2017 compared to 2016 Construction services earnings increased $19.4 million (57 percent) as a result of: Revenues: Increase of $294.3 million, primarily from an increase in the number and size of construction projects in 2017, as well as increased equipment sales and rentals. Gross margin: Increase of $36.9 million resulting from higher inside specialty contracting margins of $20.9 million driven by increased revenues, as previously discussed, and decreased costs from the successful management of labor performance on projects in a majority of the business activities performed partially offset by job losses on certain projects. Also contributing to the increased margins were higher outside specialty contracting margins of $16.0 million driven by higher contracting workloads and equipment revenues in areas impacted by storm activity. Selling, general and administrative expense: Increase of $9.1 million, primarily higher payroll-related costs, office expense and outside professional costs. Other income: Decrease of $900,000 due to the absence of interest income earned on prior year completed jobs. Interest expense: Comparable to the prior year. MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 43 Part II Income taxes: Increase of $7.8 million resulting from an increase in income before income taxes and the absence in 2017 of a $1.5 million tax benefit related to the disposition of a non-strategic asset. Partially offsetting this increase was an income tax benefit of $4.3 million for the revaluation of the segment's net deferred tax liabilities, as discussed in Item 8 - Note 13 . Outlook The Company continues to expect long-term growth in the electric transmission and distribution market, although the timing of large bids and subsequent construction is likely to be highly variable from year to year. The Company believes several small and medium-sized transmission and distribution projects will continue to be available for bid in 2019. The Company expects bidding activity to remain strong for both outside and inside specialty construction companies in 2019. Although bidding remains highly competitive in all areas, the Company expects the segment's skilled workforce will continue to provide a benefit in securing and executing profitable projects. The Company had backlog at December 31, 2018 , of $939 million , up from $708 million at December 31, 2017 . The increase in backlog was largely attributable to the new project opportunities that the Company continues to see across its diverse operations, particularly in inside specialty electrical and mechanical contracting for the hospitality and gaming, high-tech, mission critical and public entities. The Company's outside power, communications and natural gas specialty operations also have a high volume of work. The Company expects to complete a significant amount of the backlog at December 31, 2018 , during the next 12 months. Additionally, the Company continues to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities that would be accretive to the Company and grow the Company's backlog. Other Years ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Operating revenues $ 11.3 $ 7.9 $ 8.6 Operating expenses: Operation and maintenance 9.3 6.3 6.7 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.0 2.0 2.1 Taxes, other than income .1 .2 .1 Total operating expenses 11.4 8.5 8.9 Operating loss (.1 ) (.6 ) (.3 ) Other income 1.0 .9 .9 Interest expense 2.8 3.6 5.8 Loss before income taxes (1.9 ) (3.3 ) (5.2 ) Income taxes (1.2 ) (1.8 ) (2.0 ) Loss $ (.7 ) $ (1.5 ) $ (3.2 ) Included in Other are general and administrative costs and interest expense previously allocated to the exploration and production and refining businesses that do not meet the criteria for income (loss) from discontinued operations. Largely contributing to the increase in operation and maintenance expense in 2018 were costs associated with the Holding Company Reorganization. For further details on the Company's reorganization, see Items 1 and 2 Business Properties - General. Discontinued Operations Years ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Income (loss) from discontinued operations before intercompany eliminations, net of tax $ 2.9 $ 3.1 $ (303.2 ) Intercompany eliminations (6.9 ) 2.8 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 2.9 (3.8 ) (300.4 ) Loss from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest (131.7 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to the Company, net of tax $ 2.9 $ (3.8 ) $ (168.7 ) 2018 compared to 2017 The income from discontinued operations attributable to the Company was $2.9 million , primarily related to income tax adjustments, compared to a loss of $3.8 million in the prior year. The loss in 2017 was largely due to eliminations for the presentation of income tax adjustments between continuing and discontinued operations. 2017 compared to 2016 The loss from discontinued operations attributable to the Company was $3.8 million compared to a loss of $168.7 million in the prior year. The decreased loss was largely due to the absence in 2017 of a loss associated with the sale of the refining 44 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II business in June 2016, as well as the reversal in 2017 of a previously accrued liability due to the resolution of a legal matter, as discussed in Item 8 - Note 4 . Intersegment Transactions Amounts presented in the preceding tables will not agree with the Consolidated Statements of Income due to the Company's elimination of intersegment transactions. The amounts related to these items were as follows: Years ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Intersegment transactions: Operating revenues $ 64.3 $ 58.0 $ 57.4 Operation and maintenance 13.7 9.1 8.7 Purchased natural gas sold 50.6 48.9 48.7 Income from continuing operations* (6.9 ) (6.3 ) * Includes eliminations for the presentation of income tax adjustments between continuing and discontinued operations. For more information on intersegment eliminations, see Item 8 - Note 15 . Liquidity and Capital Commitments At December 31, 2018 , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $53.9 million and available borrowing capacity of $ 384.6 million under the outstanding credit facilities of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company expects to meet its obligations for debt maturing within one year and its other operating and capital requirements from various sources, including internally generated funds; the Company's credit facilities, as described later in Capital resources; the issuance of long-term debt; and issuance of equity securities. Cash flows Operating activities The changes in cash flows from operating activities generally follow the results of operations as discussed in Business Segment Financial and Operating Data and also are affected by changes in working capital. Changes in cash flows for discontinued operations are related to the former exploration and production and refining businesses. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2018 increased $51.9 million from 2017 . Increases: The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was largely driven by stronger collection of accounts receivable at the construction services and construction materials and contracting businesses and bonus depreciation for tax purposes due to the enactment of TCJA at the construction materials and contracting business. Decreases: Partially offsetting these increases were higher inventory balances at the construction materials and contracting business due to higher asphalt oil inventory, largely resulting from higher average per ton cost, and higher aggregate inventory from higher production. Also contributing to the decrease were decreased deferral of production tax credits, re-measurements of taxes on investments and accelerated tax deductions related to the TCJA. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2017 decreased $14.2 million from 2016. The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities reflects higher working capital requirements at the construction services business largely resulting from higher receivables due to increased workloads during the year and at the construction materials business due to higher receivables resulting from increased workloads later in the year. Higher natural gas purchases including the effects of colder weather also added to higher working capital requirements at the natural gas distribution business. Higher income taxes paid from continuing operations was largely offset by higher income tax benefits received from discontinued operations resulting from the realization of net operating losses at the discontinued operations. Higher earnings from continuing operations in 2017, compared to 2016, partially offset the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities. Higher margins at the electric, natural gas distribution and construction services businesses were partially offset by lower margins at the construction materials business. Investing activities Cash flows used in investing activities in 2018 increased $496.7 million from 2017 . The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to acquisition activity in 2018 at the construction materials and contracting business; the absence in 2018 of net proceeds from the sale of Pronghorn in January 2017 and higher capital expenditures in 2018 at the pipeline and midstream business; and higher capital expenditures related to various construction projects in 2018 at the electric and natural gas distribution businesses. MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 45 Part II Cash flows used in investing activities in 2017 decreased $90.9 million from 2016, largely resulting from net proceeds from the sale of Pronghorn in January 2017 at the pipeline and midstream business. Financing activities Cash flows provided by financing activities in 2018 increased $475.7 million from 2017 . The increase in cash provided by financing activities was largely due to increased debt issuance from an increase in commercial paper balances used for acquisitions, ongoing capital expenditures and working capital needs at the construction materials and contacting business; the issuance of an additional $200 million in term loans for capital projects at the electric and natural gas distribution businesses; and the issuance of an additional $40 million under the private shelf agreement for capital projects at the pipeline and midstream business. The increase in issuance of long-term debt was partially offset by higher debt repayment on a line of credit at the natural gas distribution business; higher debt repayment on debt that matured during third quarter 2018 at the electric and natural gas distribution businesses; and the strong collection of accounts receivable resulting in lower commercial paper balances at the construction services business. Cash flows used in financing activities in 2017 increased $50.4 million from 2016, primarily due to the higher net repayment of long-term debt. Defined benefit pension plans The Company has noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plans for certain employees. Plan assets consist of investments in equity and fixed-income securities. Various actuarial assumptions are used in calculating the benefit expense (income) and liability (asset) related to the pension plans. Actuarial assumptions include assumptions about the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. At December 31, 2018 , the pension plans' accumulated benefit obligations exceeded these plans' assets by approximately $83.8 million . Pretax pension expense reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , was $843,000 , $1.7 million and $2.0 million , respectively. The Company's pension expense is currently projected to be less than $1.0 million in 2019 . Funding for the pension plans is actuarially determined. The minimum required contributions for the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $6.1 million . There were no minimum required contributions for 2017 and 2016 . For more information on the Company's pension plans, see Item 8 - Note 16 . Capital expenditures The Company's capital expenditures from continuing operations for 2016 through 2018 and as anticipated for 2019 through 2021 are summarized in the following table. Actual* Estimated 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 (In millions) Capital expenditures: Electric $ 111 $ 109 $ 186 $ 104 $ 103 $ 88 Natural gas distribution 126 147 206 204 180 158 Pipeline and midstream 35 31 70 113 93 204 Construction materials and contracting 38 44 280 133 135 127 Construction services 60 19 25 25 17 18 Other 2 2 2 5 3 3 Total capital expenditures $ 372 $ 352 $ 769 $ 584 $ 531 $ 598 * $33.4 million , $10.5 million and $(15.8) million , respectively. The 2018 capital expenditures include the four acquisitions at the construction materials and contracting segment, as discussed in Item 8 - Note 3 . The 2018 capital expenditures were funded by internal sources, issuance of long-term debt and issuance of the Company's equity securities. The Company has included in the estimated capital expenditures for 2019 through 2021 the Demicks Lake project, Line Section 22 Expansion project and North Bakken Expansion project, as previously discussed in Business Segment Financial and Operating Data . Estimated capital expenditures for the years 2019 through 2021 include those for: System upgrades Routine replacements Service extensions Routine equipment maintenance and replacements Buildings, land and building improvements 46 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II Pipeline, gathering and other midstream projects Power generation and transmission opportunities Environmental upgrades Other growth opportunities The Company continues to evaluate potential future acquisitions and other growth opportunities that would be incremental to the outlined capital program; however, they are dependent upon the availability of economic opportunities and, as a result, capital expenditures may vary significantly from the estimates in the preceding table. It is anticipated that all of the funds required for capital expenditures for the years 2019 through 2021 will be funded by various sources, including internally generated funds; the Company's credit facilities, as described later; issuance of long-term debt; and issuance of equity securities. Capital resources Certain debt instruments of the Company and its subsidiaries, including those discussed later, contain restrictive and financial covenants and cross-default provisions. In order to borrow under the respective credit agreements, the Company and its subsidiaries must be in compliance with the applicable covenants and certain other conditions, all of which the Company and its subsidiaries, as applicable, were in compliance with at December 31, 2018 . In the event the Company and its subsidiaries do not comply with the applicable covenants and other conditions, alternative sources of funding may need to be pursued. For more information on the covenants, certain other conditions and cross-default provisions, see Item 8 - Note 8 . The following table summarizes the outstanding revolving credit facilities of the Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2018 : Company Facility Facility Limit Amount Outstanding Letters of Credit Expiration Date (In millions) MDU Resources Group, Inc. Commercial paper/Revolving credit agreement (a) $ 175.0 $ 48.5 $ 6/8/23 Cascade Natural Gas Corporation Revolving credit agreement $ 75.0 (c) $ 53.8 $ 2.2 (d) 4/24/20 Intermountain Gas Company Revolving credit agreement $ 85.0 (e) $ 56.3 $ 4/24/20 Centennial Energy Holdings, Inc. Commercial paper/Revolving credit agreement (f) $ 500.0 $ 289.6 (b) $ 9/23/21 (a) The commercial paper program is supported by a revolving credit agreement with various banks (provisions allow for increased borrowings, at the option of the Company on stated conditions, up to a maximum of $225.0 million ). The amount outstanding under the revolving credit agreement was $48.5 million . (b) Amount outstanding under commercial paper program. (c) Certain provisions allow for increased borrowings, up to a maximum of $100.0 million . (d) Outstanding letter(s) of credit reduce the amount available under the credit agreement. (e) Certain provisions allow for increased borrowings, up to a maximum of $110.0 million . (f) The commercial paper program is supported by a revolving credit agreement with various banks (provisions allow for increased borrowings, at the option of Centennial on stated conditions, up to a maximum of $600.0 million ). There were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. The Company's and Centennial's respective commercial paper programs are supported by revolving credit agreements. While the amount of commercial paper outstanding does not reduce available capacity under the respective revolving credit agreements, the Company and Centennial do not issue commercial paper in an aggregate amount exceeding the available capacity under their credit agreements. The commercial paper borrowings may vary during the period, largely the result of fluctuations in working capital requirements due to the seasonality of the construction businesses. Total equity as a percent of total capitalization was 55 percent and 59 percent at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. This ratio is calculated as the Company's total equity, divided by the Company's total capital. Total capital is the Company's total debt, including short-term borrowings and long-term debt due within one year, plus total equity. This ratio is an indicator of how the Company is financing its operations, as well as its financial strength. The following includes information related to the preceding table. MDU Resources Group, Inc. The Company's revolving credit agreement supports its commercial paper program. Commercial paper borrowings under this agreement are classified as long-term debt as they are intended to be refinanced on a long-term basis through continued commercial paper borrowings. The Company's objective is to maintain acceptable credit ratings in order to access the capital markets through the issuance of commercial paper. Historically, downgrades in the Company's credit ratings have not limited, nor are currently expected to limit, the Company's ability to access the capital markets. If the Company were to experience a downgrade of its credit ratings MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 47 Part II in the future, it may need to borrow under its credit agreement and may experience an increase in overall interest rates with respect to its cost of borrowings. On January 1, 2019, the Company's revolving credit agreement and commercial paper program became Montana-Dakota's revolving credit agreement and commercial paper program as a result of the Holding Company Reorganization. The outstanding balance of the revolving credit agreement was also transferred to Montana-Dakota. All of the related terms and covenants of the credit agreements remained the same. Prior to the maturity of the credit agreement, Montana-Dakota expects that it will negotiate the extension or replacement of this agreement. If Montana-Dakota is unable to successfully negotiate an extension of, or replacement for, the credit agreement, or if the fees on this facility become too expensive, which Montana-Dakota does not currently anticipate, it would seek alternative funding. Cascade Cascade's credit agreement contains customary covenants and provisions, including a covenant of Cascade not to permit, at any time, the ratio of total debt to total capitalization to be greater than 65 percent. Cascade's ratio of total debt to total capitalization as of December 31, 2018, was 51 percent. Other covenants include restrictions on the sale of certain assets, limitations on indebtedness and the making of certain investments. Cascade's credit agreement also contains cross-default provisions. These provisions state that if Cascade fails to make any payment with respect to any indebtedness or contingent obligation, in excess of a specified amount, under any agreement that causes such indebtedness to be due prior to its stated maturity or the contingent obligation to become payable, Cascade will be in default under the revolving credit agreement. Intermountain Intermountain's credit agreement contains customary covenants and provisions, including a covenant of Intermountain not to permit, at any time, the ratio of total debt to total capitalization to be greater than 65 percent. Intermountain's ratio of total debt to total capitalization as of December 31, 2018, was 49 percent. Other covenants include restrictions on the sale of certain assets, limitations on indebtedness and the making of certain investments. Intermountain's credit agreement also contains cross-default provisions. These provisions state that if Intermountain fails to make any payment with respect to any indebtedness or contingent obligation, in excess of a specified amount, under any agreement that causes such indebtedness to be due prior to its stated maturity or the contingent obligation to become payable, or certain conditions result in an early termination date under any swap contract that is in excess of a specified amount, then Intermountain will be in default under the revolving credit agreement. Centennial Centennial's revolving credit agreement supports its commercial paper program. Commercial paper borrowings under this agreement are classified as long-term debt as they are intended to be refinanced on a long-term basis through continued commercial paper borrowings. Centennial's objective is to maintain acceptable credit ratings in order to access the capital markets through the issuance of commercial paper. Historically, downgrades in Centennial's credit ratings have not limited, nor are currently expected to limit, Centennial's ability to access the capital markets. If Centennial were to experience a downgrade of its credit ratings in the future, it may need to borrow under its credit agreement and may experience an increase in overall interest rates with respect to its cost of borrowings. Prior to the maturity of the Centennial credit agreement, Centennial expects that it will negotiate the extension or replacement of this agreement, which provides credit support to access the capital markets. In the event Centennial is unable to successfully negotiate this agreement, or in the event the fees on this facility become too expensive, which Centennial does not currently anticipate, it would seek alternative funding.

New Accounting Standards For information regarding new accounting standards, see Item 8 - Note 1 , which is incorporated herein by reference. Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates The Company has prepared its financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company's significant accounting policies are discussed in Item 8 - Note 1 . Estimates are used for items such as impairment testing of long-lived assets and goodwill; fair values of acquired assets and liabilities under the acquisition method of accounting; aggregate reserves; property depreciable lives; tax provisions; revenue recognized using the cost-to-cost measure of progress for contracts; uncollectible accounts; environmental and other loss contingencies; accumulated provision for revenues subject to refund; costs on construction contracts; unbilled revenues; actuarially determined benefit costs; asset retirement obligations; and the valuation of stock-based compensation. The Company's critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties that affect the application of such policies. As discussed below, the Company's financial position or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates. The following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates. Impairment of long-lived assets and intangibles The Company reviews the carrying values of its long-lived assets and intangibles, excluding assets held for sale, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually for goodwill. MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 49 Part II Goodwill The Company performs its goodwill impairment testing annually in the fourth quarter. In addition, the test is performed on an interim basis whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or circumstances may include a significant adverse change in business climate, weakness in an industry in which the Company's reporting units operate or recent significant cash or operating losses with expectations that those losses will continue. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process performed at the reporting unit level. The Company has determined that the reporting units for its goodwill impairment test are its operating segments, or components of an operating segment, that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results. For more information on the Company's operating segments, see Item 8 - Note 15 . The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the test is complete and no impairment is recorded. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, step two of the test is performed to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any. The impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to the carrying value of that goodwill. If the carrying value is greater than the implied fair value, an impairment loss must be recorded. For the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , there were no impairment losses recorded. At December 31, 2018 , the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value at all reporting units. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates which include assumptions about the Company's future revenue, profitability and cash flows, amount and timing of estimated capital expenditures, inflation rates, risk adjusted cost of capital, operational plans, and current and future economic conditions, among others. The fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a weighted combination of income and market approaches. The Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology for its income approach. Under the income approach, the discounted cash flow model determines fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows over a specified period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period. Both values are discounted using a rate which reflects the best estimate of the risk adjusted cost of capital at each reporting unit. The risk adjusted cost of capital, which varies by reporting unit and is in the range of 5 percent to 9 percent, and a long-term growth rate projection of approximately 3 percent were utilized in the goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2018 . Under the market approach, the Company estimates fair value using multiples derived from enterprise value to EBITDA for comparative peer companies for each respective reporting unit. These multiples are applied to operating data for each reporting unit to arrive at an indication of fair value. In addition, the Company adds a reasonable control premium when calculating the fair value utilizing the peer multiples, which is estimated as the premium that would be received in a sale in an orderly transaction between market participants. The Company believes that the estimates and assumptions used in its impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information. Long-Lived Assets Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long-lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of the Company's assets and result in an impairment charge. If an impairment indicator exists for tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, the asset group held and used is tested for recoverability by comparing an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets compared to the carrying value of the assets. If impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. There is risk involved when determining the fair value of assets, tangible and intangible, as there may be unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions that have a material impact on the estimated amount and timing of future cash flows. In addition, the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in the valuation techniques used. The Company believes its estimates used in calculating the fair value of long-lived assets, including goodwill and identifiable intangibles, are reasonable based on the information that is known when the estimates are made. Business combinations The Company accounts for acquisitions on the Consolidated Financial Statements starting from the date of the acquisition, which is the date that control is obtained. The acquisition method of accounting requires acquired assets and liabilities assumed be recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The estimation of fair values of acquired assets and liabilities assumed by the Company requires significant judgment and requires various assumptions. Although independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, the appraised values may be based on significant estimates provided by management. The amounts and useful lives assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets compared to amounts assigned to goodwill, which is not amortized, can affect the results of operations in the period of and periods subsequent to a business combination. In determining fair values of acquired assets and liabilities assumed, the Company uses various observable inputs for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and various unobservable inputs, which includes the use of valuation models. Fair values are based on various 50 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II factors including, but not limited to, age and condition of property, maintenance records, auction values for equipment with similar characteristics, recent sales and listings of comparable properties, data collected from drill holes and other subsurface investigations and geologic data. The Company primarily uses the market and cost approaches in determining the fair value of land and property, plant and equipment. A combination of the market and income approaches are used for aggregate reserves and intangibles, primarily a discounted cash flow model. There is a measurement period after the acquisition date during which the Company may adjust the amounts recognized for a business combination. Any such adjustments are recorded in the period the adjustment is determined with the corresponding offset to goodwill. These adjustments are typically based on obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The measurement period ends once the Company has obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date, but does not extend beyond one year from the date of the acquisition. Once the measurement period has ended, any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed are recorded in income from continuing operations. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The recognition of revenue requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue. The accuracy of revenues reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements depends on, among other things, management's estimates of total costs to complete projects because the Company uses the cost-to-cost measure of progress on construction contracts for revenue recognition. To determine the proper revenue recognition method for contracts, the Company evaluates whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one single contract and whether the combined or single contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. This evaluation requires significant judgment and the decision to combine a group of contracts or separate the combined or single contract into multiple performance obligations could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. For most contracts, the customer contracts with the Company to provide a significant service of integrating a complex set of tasks and components into a single project. Hence, the Company's contracts are generally accounted for as one performance obligation. The Company recognizes construction contract revenue over time using the cost-to-cost measure of progress for contracts because it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer which occurs as the Company incurs costs on the contract. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the costs incurred are compared with total estimated costs of a performance obligation. Revenues are recorded proportionately to the costs incurred. This method depends largely on the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates related to the extent of progress toward completion of the contract, contract revenues and contract costs. Inasmuch as contract prices are generally set before the work is performed, the estimates pertaining to every project could contain significant unknown risks such as volatile labor, material and fuel costs, weather delays, adverse project site conditions, unforeseen actions by regulatory agencies, performance by subcontractors, job management and relations with project owners. Changes in estimates could have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Several factors are evaluated in determining the bid price for contract work. These include, but are not limited to, the complexities of the job, past history performing similar types of work, seasonal weather patterns, competition and market conditions, job site conditions, work force safety, reputation of the project owner, availability of labor, materials and fuel, project location and project completion dates. As a project commences, estimates are continually monitored and revised as information becomes available and actual costs and conditions surrounding the job become known. If a loss is anticipated on a contract, the loss is immediately recognized. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements. The Company considers contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Generally, contract modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration of services provided in the context of the contract and are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and the measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis. The Company's construction contracts generally contain variable consideration including liquidated damages, performance bonuses or incentives, claims, unapproved/unpriced change orders and penalties or index pricing. The variable amounts usually arise upon achievement of certain performance metrics or change in project scope. The Company estimates the amount of revenue to be recognized on variable consideration using estimation methods that best predict the most likely amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to or expects to incur. The Company includes variable consideration in the estimated transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Changes in circumstances could impact management's estimates made in determining the value of variable consideration MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K 51 Part II recorded. The Company updates its estimate of the transaction price each reporting period and the effect of variable consideration on the transaction price is recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis. The Company believes its estimates surrounding the cost-to-cost method are reasonable based on the information that is known when the estimates are made. The Company has contract administration, accounting and management control systems in place that allow its estimates to be updated and monitored on a regular basis. Because of the many factors that are evaluated in determining bid prices, it is inherent that the Company's estimates have changed in the past and will continually change in the future as new information becomes available for each job. Pension and other postretirement benefits The Company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for certain eligible employees. Various actuarial assumptions are used in calculating the benefit expense (income) and liability (asset) related to these plans. Costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits bear the risk of change, as they are dependent upon numerous factors based on assumptions of future conditions. The Company makes various assumptions when determining plan costs, including the current discount rates and the expected long-term return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases, actuarially determined mortality data and health care cost trend rates. In selecting the expected long-term return on plan assets, which is considered to be one of the key variables in determining benefit expense or income, the Company considers historical returns, current market conditions and expected future market trends, including changes in interest rates and equity and bond market performance. Another key variable in determining benefit expense or income is the discount rate. In selecting the discount rate, the Company matches forecasted future cash flows of the pension and postretirement plans to a yield curve which consists of a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds with varying maturity dates, as well as other factors, as a basis. The Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed-income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity and bond market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the future. Management estimates the rate of compensation increase based on long-term assumed wage increases and the health care cost trend rates are determined by historical and future trends. The Company estimates that a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate or in the expected return on plan assets would each increase expense by less than $1.5 million (after tax) for the year ended December 31, 2018 . The Company believes the estimates made for its pension and other postretirement benefits are reasonable based on the information that is known when the estimates are made. These estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of variables and are expected to change in the future. Estimates and assumptions will be affected by changes in the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase and health care cost trend rates. The Company plans to continue to use its current methodologies to determine plan costs. For more information on the assumptions used in determining plan costs, see Item 8 - Note 16 . Income taxes The Company is required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and ongoing operations to estimate the Company's obligation to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, real estate, franchise and sales/use taxes. Judgments related to income taxes require the recognition in the Company's financial statements a tax position that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained on audit. Judgment and estimation is required in developing the provision for income taxes and the reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities and, if necessary, any valuation allowances. The interpretation of tax laws can involve uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret such laws differently. Actual income tax could vary from estimated amounts and may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income, cash flows, and tax-related assets and liabilities. In addition, the effective tax rate may be affected by other changes including the allocation of property, payroll and revenues between states. The Company assesses the deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration historical and anticipated earnings levels; the reversal of other existing temporary differences; available net operating losses and tax carryforwards; and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and amount of, a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. As facts and circumstances change, adjustment to the valuation allowance may be required. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Business Segment Financial and Operating Data includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as another financial measure, adjusted gross margin, that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as it relates to the Company's electric and natural gas distribution segments. The presentation of adjusted gross margin is intended to be a useful supplemental financial measure for 52 MDU Resources Group, Inc. Form 10-K Part II investors understanding of the segments' operating performance. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, GAAP financial measures such as operating income (loss) or earnings (loss). The Company's non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted gross margin, is not standardized; therefore, it may not be possible to compare this financial measure with other companies gross margin measures having the same or similar names. In addition to operating revenues and operating expenses, management also uses the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted gross margin when evaluating the results of operations for the electric and natural gas distribution segments. Adjusted gross margin for the electric and natural gas distribution segments is calculated by adding back adjustments to operating income (loss). These add-back adjustments include: operation and maintenance expense; depreciation, depletion and amortization expense; and certain taxes, other than income. Adjusted gross margin includes operating revenues less the cost of electric fuel and purchased power, purchased natural gas sold and certain taxes, other than income. These taxes, other than income, included as a reduction to adjusted gross margin relate to revenue taxes. These segments pass on to their customers the increases and decreases in the wholesale cost of power purchases, natural gas and other fuel supply costs in accordance with regulatory requirements. As such, the segments' revenues are directly impacted by the fluctuations in such commodities. Revenue taxes, which are passed back to customers, fluctuate with revenues as they are calculated as a percentage of revenues. For these reasons, period over period, the segments' operating income (loss) is generally not impacted. The Company's management believes the adjusted gross margin is a useful supplemental financial measure as these items are included in both operating revenues and operating expenses. The Company's management also believes that adjusted gross margin and the remaining operating expenses that calculate operating income (loss) are useful in assessing the Company's utility performance as management has the ability to influence control over the remaining operating expenses. The following information reconciles operating income to adjusted gross margin for the electric segment. Years ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Operating income $ 65.2 $ 79.9 $ 67.9 Adjustments: Operating expenses: Operation and maintenance 123.0 122.2 115.8 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 51.0 47.7 50.2 Taxes, other than income 14.5 13.5 12.3 Total adjustments 188.5 183.4 178.3 Adjusted gross margin $ 253.7 $ 263.3 $ 246.2 The following information reconciles operating income to adjusted gross margin for the natural gas distribution segment.
