ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K . In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. See the Note about Forward-Looking Statements for additional information. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K , particularly in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. Overview Chegg is the smarter way to student. As the leading direct-to-student learning platform, we strive to improve educational outcomes by putting the student first in all our decisions. We support students on their journey from high school to college and into their career with tools designed to help them pass their test, pass their class, and save money on required materials. Our services are available online, anytime and anywhere, so we can reach students when they need us most. Students subscribe to our digital products and services, which we collectively refer to as Chegg Services. These include Chegg Study, Chegg Writing, Chegg Tutors, Brand Partnership, Test Prep and Internships . Our Chegg Study service provides step-by-step Textbook Solutions and Expert Answers, helping students with their course work. When students need help creating citations for their papers, they can use one of our Chegg Writing properties, including EasyBib, Citation Machine, BibMe, CiteThisForMe, and NormasAPA. When students need additional help on a subject, they can reach a live tutor online, anytime, anywhere through Chegg Tutors. We work with leading brands to provide students with discounts, promotions, and other products. We provide access to internships to help students gain skills and experiences that are critical to securing their first job. We provide students with an online adaptive test preparation service currently covering the ACT and SAT exams and, in August 2017, we entered into a partnership with Kaplan Test Prep (Kaplan) to provide their test prep courses, practice products, and books through our website. Additionally, Chegg and Kaplan recently launched co-branded new test prep programs starting as low as $99. Through our strategic partnership with Ingram Content Group (Ingram), we offer Required Materials, which includes an extensive print textbook and eTextbook library for rent and sale, helping students save money compared to the cost of buying new. To deliver services to students, we partner with a variety of third parties. We source print textbooks, eTextbooks, and supplemental materials directly or indirectly from thousands of publishers in the United States, including Pearson, Cengage Learning, McGraw Hill, Wiley, and MacMillan. We have a large network of students and professionals who leverage our platform to tutor in their spare time and employers who leverage our platform to post their internships and jobs. In addition, because we have a large student user base, local and national brands partner with us to reach the college and high school demographics. During the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we generated net revenues of $255.1 million , $254.1 million and $301.4 million , respectively, and in the same periods had net losses of $20.3 million , $42.2 million and $59.2 million , respectively. We plan to continue to invest in our long-term growth, particularly further investment in the technology that powers our learning platform and the development of additional products and services that serve students. Our strategy for achieving and maintaining profitability is centered upon our ability to utilize Chegg Services to increase student engagement with our learning platform. We plan to continue to invest in the expansion of our Chegg Services to provide a more compelling and personalized solution and deepen engagement with students. In October 2017, we acquired Cogeon GmbH, a privately held online learning company based in Berlin, Germany that provides adaptive math technology, primarily through its application, Math 42. We anticipate this acquisition to increase value to existing subscribers and deepen our reach into the high school market which will allow us to drive further growth in our existing Chegg Services. In addition, we believe that the investments we have made to achieve our current scale will allow us to drive increased operating margins over time that, together with increased contributions of Chegg Services products, will enable us to accomplish profitability and become cash-flow positive in the long-term. Our ability to achieve these long-term objectives is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including our ability to attract, retain, and increasingly engage the student population, intense competition in our markets, the ability to achieve sufficient contributions to revenue from Chegg Services and other factors described in greater detail in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. 39 Table of Contents We have presented revenues for our two product lines, Chegg Services and Required Materials, based on how students view us and the utilization of our products by them. More detail on our two product lines is discussed in the next two sections titled "Chegg Services" and "Required Materials." Chegg Services Our Chegg Services for students primarily includes our Chegg Study service, our Chegg Writing service, and our Chegg Tutors service. We also work with leading brands, such as Proctor & Gamble, Sallie Mae, Discover, Truth, DIRECTV and YouTube to provide students with discounts, promotions, and other products that, based on student feedback, delight them. For example, for Proctor & Gamble, we inserted free laundry care samples in our print textbook rental shipments to students, and for DIRECTV, we promoted a 50% off college student discount to the popular NFL Sunday Ticket streaming service via our email and digital channels. All of our brand advertising services and the discounts, promotions, and other products provided to students are paid for by the brands. We additionally provide Internship services and, through our partnership with Kaplan, our Test Prep services covering a variety of exams. Students typically pay to access Chegg Services such as Chegg Study on a monthly or annual basis. In the aggregate, Chegg Services revenues were 73% , 51% and 31% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Required Materials Our Required Materials product line includes commissions from Ingram and other partners, on the rental and sale of print textbooks, as well as revenues from eTextbooks . We offer our eTextbooks on a standalone basis or as a rental-equivalent solution and for free to students awaiting the arrival of their print textbook rental for select print textbooks. eTextbooks and supplemental course materials are available from approximately 120 publishers as of December 31, 2017 . We also use our website to rent and sell, on behalf of Ingram and other partners, as well as source for used print textbooks for our partner Ingram. We attract students to our website by offering more for their used print textbooks than they could generally get by selling them back to their campus bookstore. In the aggregate, Required Materials revenues were 27% , 49% , and 69% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Strategic Partnership with Ingram and Agreements with Other Partners Our strategic partnership with Ingram and agreements with other partners have helped to accelerate the growth of our Chegg Services products by allowing us to utilize capital otherwise historically spent on the purchase of print textbooks, and at the same time allowing us to maintain a leading position and high brand recognition through our iconic orange boxes. We entered into a definitive inventory purchase and consignment agreement with Ingram that allows us to focus on eTextbooks and Chegg Services. Under the agreement, since May 2015, Ingram has been responsible for all new investments in the print textbook library, fulfillment logistics, and has title and risk of loss related to print textbook rentals. We have also entered into agreements with other partners to provide our customers with better pricing and a wider variety of new editions of print textbooks. As a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram and agreements with other partners, our revenues include a commission on the total transaction amount that we earn upon Ingram's fulfillment of a rental transaction using print textbooks for which Ingram or the other partner has title and risk of loss, as opposed to the total rental transaction amount. These partnerships allow us to reduce and eliminate the capital requirements and operating expenses we historically incurred to acquire and maintain a print textbook library. We will continue to procure books on Ingram behalf including books through our buyback program and invoice Ingram at cost. Seasonality of Our Business Historically, a substantial majority of our revenues were recognized ratably over the term a student rents our print textbooks and eTextbooks or has access to our Chegg Services. This has generally resulted in our highest revenues in the fourth quarter as it reflects more days of the academic year and our lowest revenues in the second quarter as colleges conclude their academic year for summer and there are fewer days of rentals. The recognition of revenues from our eTextbooks and Chegg Services will continue to follow these trends. As a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, however, revenues from all print textbook transactions will now be higher in the first and third quarters as we recognize a commission on the transaction immediately rather than recognizing the revenues ratably over the term the student rents the print textbooks. 40 Table of Contents The variable expenses associated with our shipments of print textbooks and marketing activities historically were highest in the first and third quarters as shipping and other fulfillment costs and marketing expenses are expensed when incurred, generally at the beginning of academic terms. However, these variable expenses related to the shipments of print textbooks have decreased as we have completely transitioned the shipping and fulfillment activities related to print textbooks to Ingram. As a result of these factors, the most concentrated periods for our revenues and expenses did not necessarily coincide, and comparisons of our historical quarterly operating results on a sequential basis may not provide meaningful insight into our overall financial performance. Our strategic partnership with Ingram has shifted peak revenues in the periods that a student rents a textbook as a result of the immediate revenue recognition as well as our revenue sharing agreement such that we believe our revenues will provide more meaningful insight on a sequential basis going forward. Further, while our expenses associated with the print textbook rental business have decreased, our variable expenses related to marketing activities continue to remain highest in the first and third quarter such that our profitability may not provide meaningful insight on a sequential basis. Components of Results of Operations Net Revenues We derive our revenues from our Chegg Services, the rental or sale of print textbooks and eTextbooks, commissions earned from Ingram and other partners from the rental or sale of their textbooks, net of allowances for refunds or charge backs from our payment processors who process payments from credit cards, debit cards and PayPal. As of December 2016, we no longer rent or sell our print textbooks and therefore all revenues from print textbook rental and sale orders from this date forward are commission-based. Our Chegg Services product line includes our Chegg Study service, our Chegg Writing service, our Chegg Tutors service, Test Prep, through our partnership with Kaplan, Internship services, Brand Partnership services that we offer to brands and Enrollment Marketing services to colleges, through our strategic partnership with NRCCUA. Chegg Services are offered to students through weekly, monthly or annual subscriptions, and we recognize revenues ratably over the respective subscription period. Enrollment Marketing services and Brand Partnership services are offered either on a subscription or on an a la carte basis. Revenues are recognized ratably or as earned over the subscription service period, generally one year. Revenues from Enrollment Marketing services or Brand Partnership services delivered on an a la carte basis, without a subscription, are recognized when delivery of the respective lead or service has occurred. For these services, we bill the customer at the inception, over the term of the customer arrangement or as the services are performed. Upon satisfactory assessment of creditworthiness, we generally grant credit to our Enrollment Marketing and Brand Partnership customers with normal credit terms, typically 30 days. We historically generated revenues from the rental of print textbooks and to a lesser extent, through the sales of print textbooks through our website on a just-in-time basis. Rental revenues for textbooks that we owned were previously recognized ratably over the term of the rental period, generally two to five months. Commissions earned on rental textbooks owned by Ingram and other partners are recognized immediately when a book ships to the student. During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from selling textbooks on a just-in-time basis are commission based as a result of the transition to Ingram and other partners. Our customers pay for the rental and sale of print textbooks on our website primarily by credit card, resulting in immediate settlement of our accounts receivable. We did not recognize any revenues from the rental or sale of our own print textbooks during the year ended December 31, 2017 and net revenues from the rental or sale of print textbooks represented 27% and 54% of our net revenues in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, reflecting our transition of print textbook rentals to Ingram and the increasing growth in our Chegg Services. Revenues from the rental or sale of eTextbooks is recognized ratably over the contractual period, generally two to five months or at time of the sale, respectively , and our customers pay for these services through payment processors, resulting in immediate settlement of our accounts receivable. As a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram and other partners, we no longer recognize rental revenues or sales revenues from the rental or sale of a print textbook. Instead, our services revenues includes a commission on the total transaction amount that we earn from Ingram and other partners upon Ingram's fulfillment of a rental transaction using books for which Ingram or other partner has title and risk of loss, as opposed to the total rental transaction amount. When deciding the most appropriate basis for presenting revenues or costs of revenues, both the legal form and substance of the agreement between us and our business partners are reviewed to determine each party respective role in the 41 Table of Contents transaction. Where our role in a transaction is that of principal, revenues are recognized on a gross basis. This requires revenue to comprise the gross value of the transaction billed to the customer, after trade discounts, with any related expenditure charged as a cost of revenues. Where our role in a transaction is that of an agent, revenues are recognized on a net basis with revenues representing the margin earned. In relation to our partnership with Ingram and other partners and the rental and sale of print textbooks, we recognize revenues on a net basis based on our role in the transaction as an agent. Deferred revenue primarily consists of advance payments from students and customers related to rentals and subscriptions that have not been recognized and marketing services that have yet to be performed. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenues ratably over the term or when the services are provided and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Cost of Revenues Our cost of revenues consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products and services. Certain cost of revenues, including textbook depreciation expense, the cost of textbooks sold, write-offs and allowances related to the print textbook library, have decreased during 2016 and in to 2017 as we have completely transitioned the shipping and fulfillment activities related to the rental and sale of print textbooks to Ingram. Cost of revenues consists of publisher content fees for eTextbooks, content amortization expense related to content that we develop or license, including publisher agreements for which we pay one-time license fees for published content, payment processing costs, the payments made to tutors through our Chegg Tutors service, Enrollment Marketing services leads purchased from third-party suppliers to fulfill leads that we are unable to fulfill through our internal database, personnel costs and other direct costs related to providing content or services. In addition, cost of revenues includes allocated information technology and facilities costs. Changes in our cost of revenues may be disproportionate to changes in our revenues because unrecoverable costs, such as outbound shipping and other fulfillment and payment processing fees, are expensed in the period they are incurred while our revenues may be recognized ratably over the subscription or rental term. This effect is particularly pronounced in the first and third quarters, corresponding to the beginning of academic terms. We anticipate that to the extent Chegg Services revenues grow and the execution of our strategic partnership with Ingram is successful, our gross margins will continue to improve over time. Operating Expenses We classify our operating expenses into five categories: technology and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative, restructuring charges (credits) and gain on liquidation of textbooks. One of the most significant components of our operating expenses is employee-related costs, which include share-based compensation expenses. We expect to continue to hire new employees in order to support our current and anticipated growth. In any particular period, the timing of additional hires could materially affect our operating expenses, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. Our costs and expenses contain information technology expenses and facilities expenses such as webhosting, depreciation on our infrastructure systems, lease expense and the employee-related costs for information technology support staff. We allocate these costs to each expense category, including cost of revenues, technology and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative. The allocation is primarily based on the headcount in each group at the end of a period. As our business grows, our operating expenses may increase over time to expand capacity and sustain our workforce. Technology and Development Our technology and development expenses consist of salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense for employees in our product and web design, engineering and technical teams who are responsible for maintaining our website, developing new products and improving existing products. Technology and development costs also include amortization of acquired intangible assets, webhosting costs, third-party development costs, research and development expenses and allocated information technology and facilities expenses. We expense substantially all of our technology and development expenses as they are incurred. In the past three years, our expenses have increased to support new products and services as well as to expand our infrastructure capabilities to support back-end processes associated with our revenue transactions and internal systems. We intend to continue making significant investments in developing new products and services and enhancing the functionality of existing products and services. 42 Table of Contents Sales and Marketing Our sales and marketing expenses consist of user and advertiser-facing marketing and promotional expenditures through a number of targeted online marketing channels, sponsored search, display advertising, email marketing campaigns and other initiatives. We incur salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expenses for our employees engaged in marketing, business development and sales and sales support functions and amortization of acquired intangible assets and allocated information technology and facilities costs. Our marketing expenses are largely variable; and we tend to incur these in the first and third quarters of the year due to our efforts to target students at the beginning of academic terms. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense. Sales and marketing expenses also include lead generation services and sales commissions for our Enrollment Marketing services and brand advertising. General and Administrative Our general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense for certain executives as well as our finance, legal, human resources and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include outside consulting, legal and accounting services, provision for doubtful accounts and allocated information technology and facilities costs. We have incurred additional costs as we transitioned from an emerging growth company to a large accelerated filer including increased audit, legal, regulatory and other related fees. Restructuring Charges (Credits) Restructuring charges (credits) are primarily comprised of severance costs, contract and program termination costs, asset impairments and costs of facility consolidation and closure. Restructuring charges are recorded upon approval of a formal management plan and are included in the operating results of the period in which such plan is approved and the expense becomes estimable. Gain on Liquidation of Textbooks Gain on liquidation of textbooks consists of proceeds we receive from the sale of previously rented print textbooks, through our website or to wholesalers and other channels, offset by the net book value of such textbooks. Our gain on liquidation of textbooks is driven by several factors including age of the books liquidated, the volume of books liquidated at a given point in time and the channel through which we liquidate. When the proceeds received exceed the net book value of the textbooks liquidated, we record a gain on liquidation of textbooks. Interest Expense, Net and Other Income (Expense), Net Interest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense on our debt obligations. Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances as well as the accretion of the deferred cash consideration as a result of our acquisition of Imagine Easy Solutions. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes consists primarily of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Due to the uncertainty as to the realization of the benefits of our domestic deferred tax assets, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against such assets. We intend to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. 43 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table summarizes our historical consolidated statements of operations (in thousands, except percentage of total net revenues): Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Net revenues: Rental $ % $ 39,837 16 % $ 120,365 40 % Services 255,066 100 182,399 72 133,095 44 Sales 31,854 12 47,913 16 Total net revenues 255,066 100 254,090 100 301,373 100 Cost of revenues (1) : Rental 28,637 11 98,162 33 Services 80,175 31 56,206 22 45,458 15 Sales 34,758 14 46,229 15 Total cost of revenues 80,175 31 119,601 47 189,849 63 Gross profit 174,891 69 134,489 53 111,524 37 Operating expenses (1) : Technology and development 81,926 32 66,331 26 59,391 20 Sales and marketing 51,240 20 53,949 21 64,082 21 General and administrative 64,411 25 55,372 22 45,209 15 Restructuring charges (credits) 1,047 1 (423 ) 4,868 2 Gain on liquidation of textbooks (4,766 ) (2 ) (670 ) (4,326 ) (2 ) Total operating expenses 193,858 76 174,559 69 169,224 56 Loss from operations (18,967 ) (7 ) (40,070 ) (16 ) (57,700 ) (19 ) Total interest expense, net and other income (expense), net 486 (468 ) (31 ) Loss before provision for income taxes (18,481 ) (7 ) (40,538 ) (16 ) (57,731 ) (19 ) Provision for income taxes 1,802 (1 ) 1,707 (1 ) 1,479 (1 ) Net loss $ (20,283 ) (8 )% $ (42,245 ) (17 )% $ (59,210 ) (20 )% (1) Includes share-based compensation expense as follows: Cost of revenues $ 316 $ 172 $ 262 Technology and development 14,333 14,771 11,992 Sales and marketing 5,007 6,124 7,901 General and administrative 18,703 20,718 18,620 Total share-based compensation expense $ 38,359 $ 41,785 $ 38,775 44 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 Net Revenues Net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $1.0 million , remaining relatively flat, compared to the same period in 2016 . Rental revenues decreased $39.8 million , or 100% , while services revenues increased $72.7 million , or 40% , and sales revenues decreased $31.9 million , or 100% . Net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $47.3 million, or 16%, compared to the same period in 2015. Rental revenues decreased $80.5 million or 67%, while services revenues increased $49.3 million, or 37%, and sales revenues decreased $16.1 million , or 34% . The decrease in rental revenues and sales revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was due to our strategic partnership with Ingram. As a result of our strategic partnership, our rental revenues and sales revenues are classified as services revenues to represent the commission on the total transaction amount that we earn from Ingram upon their fulfillment of a rental transaction using books for which Ingram has title and risk of loss rather than recognizing the total rental or sales revenues from transactions using our print textbooks. The increase in services revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was driven primarily from growth across our other offerings for students which included increased revenues from Chegg Study and Chegg Writing services as well as an increase in the commissions earned from Ingram. The following table sets forth our total net revenues for the periods shown for our Chegg Services and Required Materials product lines (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, Change in 2017 Change in 2016 2017 2016 2015 $ % $ % Chegg Services $ 185,683 $ 129,335 $ 94,285 $ 56,348 44 % $ 35,050 37 % Required Materials 69,383 124,755 207,088 (55,372 ) (44 )% (82,333 ) (40 )% Total net revenues $ 255,066 $ 254,090 $ 301,373 $ 976 % $ (47,283 ) (16 )% Chegg Services revenues increased $56.3 million , or 44% , in the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared to the same period in 2016 due to growth in our Chegg Study and Chegg Writing services. Chegg Services revenues represented 73% and 51% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Required Materials revenues decreased $55.4 million , or 44% , in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to our strategic partnership with Ingram. Our Required Materials revenues are comprised of a commission on the total transaction amount that we earn from Ingram rather than recognizing the total rental or sales revenues from transactions using our print textbooks.. Required Materials revenues decreased throughout 2017 as we fully transitioned new investments in the print textbook library and logistics and fulfillment for print textbook rental and sale orders to Ingram. Required Materials revenues represented 27% and 49% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Chegg Services revenues increased $35.1 million, or 37%, in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 due to growth in subscribers for our Chegg Study and Chegg Tutors services as well as revenues from our acquisition of Imagine Easy in the second quarter of 2016. Chegg Services revenues represented 51% and 31% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Required Materials revenues decreased $82.3 million, or 40%, in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to our strategic partnership with Ingram. Our Required Materials revenues are increasingly comprised of a commission on the total transaction amount that we earn from Ingram rather than recognizing the total rental or sales revenues from transactions using our print textbooks.. Required Materials revenues decreased throughout 2016 as we fully transitioned new investments in the print textbook library and logistics and fulfillment for print textbook rental and sale orders to Ingram. Required Materials revenues represented 49% and 69% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 45 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues The following table sets forth our cost of revenues for the periods shown (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, Change in 2017 Change in 2016 2017 2016 2015 $ % $ % Cost of revenues (1) $ 80,175 $ 119,601 $ 189,849 $ (39,426 ) (33 )% $ (70,248 ) (37 )% (1) Includes share-based compensation expense of: $ 316 $ 172 $ 262 $ 144 84 % $ (90 ) (34 )% Cost of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $39.4 million , or 33% , compared to the same period in 2016 . The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in textbook depreciation of $9.3 million , lower order fulfillment costs of $11.3 million , and lower cost of print textbooks sold of $25.3 million . These decreases were partially offset by higher amortization of digital content of $2.6 million , higher payment processing fees of $1.0 million , and higher employee-related expenses of $1.2 million . As a result, gross margins increased to 69% in the year ended December 31, 2017 , from 53% during the same period in 2016 . Cost of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $70.2 million, or 37%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in textbook depreciation of $34.3 million, lower order fulfillment costs of $18.3 million, lower write-offs related to our print textbook library of $4.2 million, lower warehouse personnel costs of $3.1 million and lower cost of print textbooks sold of $16.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher amortization of digital content of $5.3 million. As a result, gross margins increased to 53% in the year ended December 31, 2016, from 37% during the same period in 2015. The decreases in cost of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 and in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 resulted primarily from Ingram's fulfillment of print textbook rental and sale orders.

The increase was primarily attributable to higher employee-related expenses of $2.7 million, higher share-based compensation expense of $2.8 million, and higher web hosting and software licensing fees of $2.0 million, compared to the same period in 2015. Technology and development as a percentage of net revenues were 26% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 20% of net revenues during the same period in 2015. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $2.7 million , or 5% , compared to the same period in 2016 . The decrease was primarily attributable to lower employee-related expenses of $2.7 million , lower share-based compensation expense of $1.1 million , and lower marketing expenses of $1.3 million , compared to the same period in 2016 . These decreases were partially offset by higher software license fees of $1.3 million and higher outside services of $1.0 million compared to the same period in 2016 . Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 20% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 21% of net revenues during the same period in 2016 . Sales and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $10.1 million, or 16%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower employee-related expenses of $1.5 million, lower share-based compensation expense of $1.8 million, and lower marketing expenses of $7.4 million, compared to the same period in 2015. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained flat during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared the same period in 2015. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $9.0 million , or 16% , compared to the same period in 2016 . The increase was primarily attributable to higher employee-related expenses of $4.6 million , higher professional fees of $4.1 million primarily the result of the transition to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, implementation of Accounting Standards Codification 606, and legal fees, higher facilities expenses of $1.1 million , and higher office expenses of $1.0 million , compared to the same period in 2016 . These increases were partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense of $2.0 million , compared to the same period in 2016. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 25% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 22% of net revenues during the same period in 2016 . General and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $10.2 million, or 22%, compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to higher employee-related expenses of $5.3 million, higher share-based compensation expenses of $2.1 million, higher technology expenses of $0.9 million, higher outside services of $0.7 million, and higher professional fees of $0.9 million, compared to the same period in 2015. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 22% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 15% of net revenues during the same period in 2015. Restructuring Charges (Credits) Restructuring charges of $1.0 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 were related to our strategic partnership with NRCCUA which resulted in the termination of employees supporting the sales and account support functions of our Enrollment Marketing offering. We expect costs incurred to date related to workforce reduction to be fully paid in 2018. Restructuring credits of $0.4 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily related to a partial reversal of previously accrued lease termination costs due to our subtenant leasing additional space. We expect costs incurred to date related to the lease termination and other costs are expected to be fully paid by 2021. 47 Table of Contents Gain on Liquidation of Textbooks During the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we recorded a gain on liquidation of print textbooks of $4.8 million , $0.7 million and $4.3 million , respectively, resulting from proceeds received from liquidation of previously rented print textbooks on our website and through various other liquidation channels. Interest Expense, Net and Other Income (Expense), Net The following table sets forth our interest expense, net, and other income (expense), net, for the periods shown (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, Change in 2017 Change in 2016 2017 2016 2015 $ % $ % Interest expense, net $ (74 ) $ (171 ) $ (247 ) $ 97 (57 )% $ 76 (31 )% Other income (expense), net 560 (297 ) 216 857 n/m (513 ) n/m Total interest expense, net and other income (expense), net $ 486 $ (468 ) $ (31 ) $ 954 n/m $ (437 ) n/m _______________________________________ n/m - not meaningful Interest expense, net, decreased during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 and in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016 we replaced our previous expired credit facility with a new line of credit that carries a lower interest rate. Other income (expense), net, was a net income during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to a net expense in the same period in 2016 , primarily attributable to interest earned on investments purchased in 2017 with the net proceeds from our follow-on offering compared to the accretion of the deferred cash consideration as a result of our acquisition of Imagine Easy Solutions. Other income (expense), net, was a net expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a net income in the same period in 2015, primarily attributable to the accretion of the deferred cash consideration as a result of our acquisition of Imagine Easy Solutions. Provision for Income Taxes The following table sets forth our provision for income taxes for the periods shown (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, Change in 2017 Change in 2016 2017 2016 2015 $ % $ % Provision for income taxes $ 1,802 $ 1,707 $ 1,479 $ 95 6 % $ 228 15 % We recorded an income tax provision of approximately $1.8 million , $1.7 million , and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively, which was primarily due to state and foreign income tax expense and federal and state tax expense related to the tax amortization of acquired indefinite lived intangible assets. 48 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2017 , our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaling $228.5 million , which were held for working capital purposes. In August 2017, we completed a follow-on offering in which we raised net proceeds of $147.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs. The substantial majority of our net revenues are from e-commerce transactions with students, which are settled immediately through payment processors, as opposed to our accounts payable, which are settled based on contractual payment terms with our suppliers. We also have an aggregate principal amount of $30.0 million available under our Line of Credit with an accordion feature that, subject to the lender's discretion, allows us to borrow up to a total of $50.0 million . The Line of Credit expires in September 2019. As of December 31, 2017 , we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the Line of Credit. Further, we had no amounts outstanding and were able to borrow up to $30.0 million under the Line of Credit. As a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, we will continue to buy used print textbooks on Ingram behalf, including print textbooks through our buyback program, and invoice Ingram at cost. We provided Ingram with extended payment terms in 2015 and 2016 for the purchase of print textbooks, before moving to normal payment terms in January 2017. We had a reimbursement balance included within other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets related to the purchase of these textbooks of $4.2 million and $18.8 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. As a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, we anticipate having significantly more working capital. During the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , our proceeds from print textbook liquidations exceeded our purchases of print textbooks and resulted in a cash inflow of $6.9 million , $24.8 million , and $6.0 million , respectively. As a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, we no longer make new investments in the print textbook library and since May 1, 2015, Ingram has been responsible for all new investments in the print textbook library. As of December 31, 2017 , we have incurred cumulative losses of $391.6 million from our operations and we expect to incur additional losses in the future. Our operations have been financed primarily by our initial public offering of our common stock (IPO), our 2017 follow-on public offering, and cash generated from operations. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth, our investments in technology and development activities, our acquisition of new products and services and our sales and marketing activities. To the extent that existing cash and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to adequately fund our business plans and it could have a negative effect on our business, operating cash flows and financial condition. Most of our cash is held in the United States. As of December 31, 2017 , our foreign subsidiaries held an insignificant amount of cash in foreign jurisdictions. We currently do not foresee a need to repatriate these funds however we may take advantage of the transition tax in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that taxes any previously deferred foreign earnings and profits in 2017 at a reduced tax rate. In addition, based on our current and future needs, we believe our current funding and capital resources for our international operations are adequate. The following table sets forth our cash flows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data: Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 51,148 $ 24,938 $ (82 ) Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities $ (136,234 ) $ (5,963 ) $ 8,271 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 134,214 $ (8,675 ) $ 2,723 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Although we incurred net losses during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , our net losses were fully or partially offset by non-cash expenditures such as other depreciation and amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, and historically from print textbook library depreciation expense. Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $51.1 million . Our net loss of 49 Table of Contents $20.3 million was offset by significant non-cash operating expenses, including other depreciation and amortization expense of $19.3 million , share-based compensation expense of $38.4 million , and the change in our prepaid and other current assets of $13.6 million , which was primarily driven by the decline in the reimbursement balance from Ingram as they moved to normal payment terms in 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $24.9 million. Our net loss of $42.2 million was offset by significant non-cash operating expenses, including print textbook library depreciation expense of $9.3 million, other depreciation and amortization expense of $14.6 million, share-based compensation expense of $41.8 million and loss from write-offs of print textbooks of $1.1 million. Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $0.1 million. Our net loss of $59.2 million was increased by the change in our prepaid expenses and other current assets of $27.9 million and partially offset by significant non-cash operating expenses, including print textbook library depreciation expense of $43.6 million, other depreciation and amortization expense of $11.7 million, share-based compensation expense of $38.8 million and loss from write-offs of print textbooks of $5.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we saw a decline in our textbook depreciation expense and an increase in the change of our prepaid expenses and other current assets, which was a result of our strategic partnership with Ingram, where we are no longer making investments in our print textbook library yet continue to buy books on Ingram's behalf, while providing them with extended payment terms. The effects of these two items were the primary reasons we had net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities have been primarily related to the purchase of marketable securities, acquisition of businesses, purchases of property and equipment, and historically from the purchases of print textbooks, offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of marketable securities and the proceeds from the liquidation of print textbooks. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $136.2 million and was primarily used for the purchases of marketable securities of $128.2 million , purchases of property and equipment of $26.1 million , and the acquisition of business of $14.9 million , partially offset by proceeds from the sale or maturity of marketable securities of $26.1 million and proceeds from the liquidation of print textbooks of $6.9 million . Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $6.0 million and was primarily used for the purchases of marketable securities of $7.6 million, purchases of property and equipment of $24.7 million, acquisition of businesses of $27.1 million, and the purchase of a strategic equity investment in a third party of $1.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale or maturity of marketable securities of $29.7 million and proceeds from the liquidation of print textbooks of $25.6 million. Net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $8.3 million and was primarily used for the purchases of print textbooks of $32.3 million, purchases of marketable securities of $35.6 million, purchases of property and equipment of $8.3 million, and the purchase of a strategic equity investment in a third party of $2.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale or maturity of marketable securities of $48.2 million and proceeds from the liquidation of print textbooks of $38.3 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities have been primarily related to the issuance of common stock under stock plans offset by the payment of taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $134.2 million and was related to the proceeds from our follow-on offering, net of offering costs, of $147.6 million and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans of $23.7 million partially offset by the payment of $20.1 million in taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards and the payment of deferred cash consideration related to prior acquisitions of $16.9 million . Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $8.7 million and was related to the payment of $10.8 million in taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans of $2.1 million. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.7 million and was related to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans of $13.7 million partially offset by the payment of $8.7 50 Table of Contents million in taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards, and the repurchase of common stock of $2.3 million associated with a put option granted in connection with a prior acquisition. Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments The following is a summary of the contractual commitments associated with our lease obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands): Less than More than Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years Purchase obligations $ 22,245 $ 14,457 $ 7,688 $ 100 $ Operating lease obligations (1) 6,626 2,934 2,977 715 Total contractual obligations $ 28,871 $ 17,391 $ 10,665 $ 815 $ _____________________________________________________ (1) Our offices are leased under operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2022. In addition, our other liabilities include $2.0 million related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2017 . The timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond one year. As a result, this amount is not included in the above table. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through December 31, 2017 , we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that assumptions and estimates of the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue We evaluate whether we are acting as a principal or an agent in a transaction, and therefore whether we would record the gross sales amount and related costs as revenues or the net amount earned as commissions from the sale of third-party products. Our determination is based on our evaluation of certain indicators including whether we are responsible for fulfillment of the products or services in the transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, none of which is presumptive or determinative. Our evaluation requires management to make a judgment based on the terms of an arrangement in our determination of whether we act as a principal or an agent. If our evaluation of an arrangement was incorrect, this could impact the amount of revenues and cost of revenues recognized in a given period. 51 Table of Contents Some of our customer arrangements for Enrollment Marketing and Brand Partnership services include multiple deliverables, which include the delivery of student leads as well as other services to the end customer. We have determined these deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting, as they have value to the customer on a standalone basis and our arrangements do not contain a right of return. For these arrangements that contain multiple deliverables, we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy, which includes: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), when available; (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (TPE), if VSOE does not exist; and (iii) estimated selling price (ESP), if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We determine VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific solution when sold separately and when a substantial majority of the selling prices for these services fall within a narrow range. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers, and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of services with similar functionality cannot be obtained. As we have not established VSOE or TPE for our marketing services, we have used ESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. We have determined ESP by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, prices charged for similar offerings, sales volume, geographies, market conditions, the competitive landscape and pricing practices. Our determination of ESP requires management to make a judgment in which factors to consider when determining ESP. If different factors were considered we could conclude a different determination of ESP and this could have a material impact to the amount of revenues recognized. We believe the factors considered best represent the price at which we would transact a sale if the services were sold on a standalone basis, and we regularly assess the method used to determine ESP. Impairment of Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets We assess the impairment of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in determining when to perform an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends or significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. When measuring the recoverability of these assets, we will make assumptions regarding our estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If our estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to impair these assets. We did not record any impairment charges related to acquired intangible assets or other long-live assets during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 . As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had intangible assets, net, of $21.2 million and $20.7 million , respectively and property and equipment, net of $47.5 million and $35.3 million , respectively. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Asset Goodwill and our indefinite lived intangible asset are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test. In our qualitative assessment, we consider factors including economic conditions, industry and market conditions and developments, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. Our qualitative assessment requires management to make judgments based on the factors listed above in our determination of whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. Should we conclude that it is more likely than not that our carrying values have been impaired, we would perform a two-step impairment test. The two-step impairment test requires us to perform a valuation of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset which includes making assumptions regarding our estimated future cash flows to determine the fair value of our business. If our estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment loss. We have not recognized any impairment of goodwill or our indefinite lived intangible asset since our inception. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had goodwill of $125.3 million and $116.2 million , respectively, and an indefinite lived intangible asset related to the internships.com trade name of $3.6 million . Share-based Compensation We measure and recognize share-based compensation expense for all awards made to employees, directors and consultants, including restricted stock units (RSUs), performance-based RSUs (PSUs) and our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) based on estimated fair values. 52 Table of Contents We must estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the share-based compensation expense related to our awards. Estimated forfeitures are determined based on historical data and management expectation of exercise behaviors. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover and other factors. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our share-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the share-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the share-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements. Share-based compensation expense recognized related to PSUs is subject to the achievement of performance objectives and requires significant judgment by management in determining the current level of attainment of such performance objectives. Management may consider factors such as the latest revenue forecasts and general business trends in the assessment of whether or not a PSU award will be obtained. Subsequent changes to these considerations may have a material impact on the amount of share-based compensation expense recognized in the period related to PSU awards, which may lead to volatility of share-based compensation expense period-to-period. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our share-based compensation expense on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates, which could materially impact our future share-based compensation expense. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. We currently are providing a valuation allowance on domestic deferred tax assets. If or when recognizing deferred tax assets in the future, we will consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. We record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we recognize the tax benefit as the largest amount that is cumulative more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.
