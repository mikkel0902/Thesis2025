ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes contained within Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and the other financial information found elsewhere in this Report. Management Discussion and Analysis uses forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties as described previously in our Disclosure Regarding Forward-looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors . General Overview DXP's products are marketed in the United States, Canada and Dubai to customers that are engaged in a variety of industries, many of which may be countercyclical to each other. Demand for our products generally is subject to changes in the United States and Canada, and global and macro-economic trends affecting our customers and the industries in which they compete in particular. Certain of these industries, such as the oil and gas industry, are subject to volatility driven by a variety of factors, while others, such as the petrochemical industry and the construction industry, are cyclical and materially affected by changes in the United States and global economy. As a result, we may experience changes in demand within particular markets, segments and product categories as changes occur in our customers' respective markets. 20 Table of Contents Operating Environment Overview* 2019 2018 2017 Active Drilling Rigs** U.S 944 1,032 875 Canada 135 191 207 International 1,098 988 948 Worldwide 2,177 2,211 2,030 Gross Domestic Product (in billions) $ 21,429.0 $ 20,500.6 $ 19,485.4 West Texas Intermediate ** (per barrel) $ 56.98 $ 65.23 $ 50.80 Purchasing Managers Index 47.2 54.3 59.3 * The information contained in this table has been obtained from third party publicly available sources. ** Averages for the years indicated. During 2017, the growth rate of the general economy improved from 2016 and the rig count increased, but remained significantly below 2014 peaks. The energy market for our products improved. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $44.7 million, or 4.6%, to approximately $1.0 billion from $962.1 million for the prior corresponding period. Sales from a business sold in 2016 accounted for $22.7 million of 2016 sales. Excluding the 2016 sales of the sold business, on a same store sales basis, sales for 2017 increased by $67.4 million, or 7.2% from the prior corresponding period. This same store sales increase is the result of sales increases in our SC, IPS and SCS segments of $42.9 million, $16.9 million and $7.5 million respectively. The majority of the 2017 sales increase is the result of increased sales of pumps, bearings, industrial supplies, metal working and safety services to customers engaged in oilfield service, oil and gas exploration and production, mining, manufacturing and petrochemical processing. During 2018, the growth rate of the general economy improved from 2017 and the rig count increased, but remained significantly below 2014 peaks. The energy market for our products improved. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $209.4 million , or 20.8%, to approximately $1.2 billion from $1.0 billion for the prior corresponding period. Sales from a business acquired in 2018 accounted for $47.5 million of 2018 sales. Excluding the 2018 sales of the business acquired, on a same store sales basis, sales for 2018 increased by $161.9 million , or 16.1% from the prior corresponding period. This same store sales increase is the result of sales increases in our IPS, SC and SCS segments of $87.6 million, $61.3 million and $13.0 million respectively. The majority of the 2018 sales increase is the result of increased sales of pumps, bearings, industrial supplies, metal working and safety services to customers engaged in oilfield service, oil and gas exploration and production, mining, manufacturing and petrochemical processing. During 2019 , the growth rate of the general economy improved from 2018 while the rig count decreased, but remained higher than 2016 peaks. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $51.0 million , or 4.2% , to approximately $1.3 billion from $1.2 billion for the prior corresponding period. The majority of the 2019 sales increase is the result of increased sales of pumps, bearings, industrial supplies, metal working and safety services to customers engaged in oilfield service, oil and gas exploration and production, mining, manufacturing and petrochemical processing. Our sales growth strategy in recent years has focused on internal growth and acquisitions. Key elements of our sales strategy include leveraging existing customer relationships by cross-selling new products, expanding product offerings to new and existing customers, and increasing business-to-business solutions using system agreements and supply chain solutions for our integrated supply customers. We will continue to review opportunities to grow through the acquisition of distributors and other businesses that would expand our geographic reach and/or add additional products and services. Our results will depend on our success in executing our internal growth strategy and, to the extent we complete any acquisitions, our ability to integrate such acquisitions effectively. Our strategies to increase productivity include consolidated purchasing programs, centralizing product distribution, customer service and inside sales functions, and using information technology to increase employee productivity. 21 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2019 % 2018 % 2017 % ( in millions, except percentages and per share amounts ) Sales $ 1,267.2 100.0 $ 1,216.2 100.0 $ 1,006.8 100.0 Cost of sales 920.0 72.6 884.0 72.7 735.2 73.0 Gross profit $ 347.2 27.4 $ 332.2 27.3 $ 271.6 27.0 Selling, general & administrative expense 281.1 22.2 263.8 21.7 238.1 23.6 Operating income $ 66.1 5.2 $ 68.4 5.6 $ 33.5 3.3 Other income (1.2 ) (0.1) (0.5 ) Interest expense 19.5 1.5 20.9 1.7 17.1 1.7 Income before income taxes $ 46.6 3.7 $ 48.7 4.0 $ 16.9 1.7 Provision for income taxes 10.9 0.9 13.2 1.1 0.4 Net income $ 35.7 2.8 $ 35.5 2.9 $ 16.5 1.6 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (0.3 ) (0.1 ) (0.4 ) Net income attributable to DXP Enterprises, Inc. $ 36.0 2.8 $ 35.6 2.9 $ 16.9 1.7 Per share Basic earnings per share $ 2.04 $ 2.02 $ 0.97 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.96 $ 1.94 $ 0.93 Year Ended December 31, 2019 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018 SALES. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $51.0 million , or 4.2% , to approximately $1.3 billion from $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 . This sales increase is the result of an increase in our SCS, SC and IPS segments of $26.8 million , $12.2 million and $12.0 million , respectively. The fluctuations in sales is further explained in our business segment discussions below. Years Ended December 31 2019 2018 Change Change% Sales by Business Segment (in thousands, except change%) Service Centers $ 762,256 $ 750,044 $ 12,212 1.6 % Innovative Pumping Solutions 303,655 291,697 11,958 4.1 % Supply Chain Services 201,278 174,456 26,822 15.4 % Total DXP Sales $ 1,267,189 $ 1,216,197 $ 50,992 4.2 % Service Centers Segment. Sales for the Service Centers segment increased by $12.2 million , or 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 . This sales increase is primarily the result of increased sales of rotating equipment to customers engaged in the late upstream, midstream or downstream oil and gas markets or manufacturing equipment for these markets in connection with increased capital spending by oil and gas producers. If crude oil and natural gas prices and the drilling rig count remain at levels experienced during the year ended December 31, 2019 , this level of sales to the oil and gas industry might continue, or improve, during 2020; however, signs of contraction have appeared in the oil and gas markets in early 2020. Innovative Pumping Solutions Segment. Sales for the IPS segment increased by $12.0 million , or 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 . This increase was primarily the result of an increase in the capital spending by oil and gas producers and related businesses stemming from an increase in U.S. crude oil production during the year ended December 31, 2019 . This level of IPS sales might continue, or improve, during 2020 if crude oil and natural gas prices and the drilling rig count remain at levels experienced during 2019; however, signs of contraction have appeared in the oil and gas markets in early 2020. 22 Table of Contents Supply Chain Services Segment. Sales for the SCS segment increased by $26.8 million , or 15.4% , for the year ended December 31, 2019 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 . The improved sales are primarily related to increased sales to customers in the medical device, aerospace, oil and gas and food and beverage industries as a result of new locations. GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by approximately 9 basis points from the prior year's corresponding period. The increase in the gross profit percentage is primarily the result of an approximate 95 basis points increase in the gross profit percentage in our IPS segment. These fluctuations are explained in the segment discussions below. Service Centers Segment. As a percentage of sales, the gross profit percentage for the Service Centers increased approximately 3 basis points from the prior year's corresponding period. This was primarily as a result of sales mix and price increases from vendors. Operating income for the Service Centers segment increased $6.1 million , or 7.5% . The increase in operating income is primarily the result of the improved sales. Innovative Pumping Solutions Segment. As a percentage of sales, 2019 gross profit percentage for the IPS segment increased approximately 95 basis points from the prior year's corresponding period primarily as a result of increased utilization and capacity within IPS' engineered-to-order business and an overall improvement in the pricing environment driven by an increase in capital spending by oil and gas producers. Additionally, gross profit margins for individual orders have continued to improve because of the increase in sales of built to order customer specific products. Operating income for the IPS segment decreased $5.0 million , or 14.9% , primarily as a result of an increase in SG&A expense due to increased payroll, incentive compensation and related taxes and 401(k) expenses mainly due to increased headcount offset by the above mentioned increase in sales. Supply Chain Services Segment. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 40 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2019 , compared to the prior year's corresponding period. This was primarily as a result of costs associated with new customer implementation. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $1.8 million compared to the prior year's corresponding period mainly due to an increase in SG&A of $7.1 million as a result of increased payroll, incentive compensation and related taxes and 401(k) expenses mainly due to increased headcount partially offset by an increase in gross profit of $5.3 million . SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ("SG&A"). Selling, general and administrative expense for year ended December 31, 2019 increased by approximately $17.3 million , or 6.6% , to $281.1 million from $263.8 million for prior year's corresponding period. The overall increase in SG&A is primarily the result of increased payroll, incentive compensation and related taxes and 401(k) expenses. The remaining increase in SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily a result of the increase in sales. As a percentage of sales, the year ended December 31, 2019 expense increased 50 basis points to 22.2% from 21.7% for the prior year's corresponding period. OPERATING INCOME. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $2.3 million , or 3.4% , to $66.1 million from $68.5 million in the prior year's corresponding period. This decrease in operating income is primarily related to the increase in SG&A discussed above. INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense for year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $1.4 million , or 6.9% , from prior year's corresponding period primarily as a result of third party fees of $0.9 million and $60 thousand of accelerated deferred debt issuance cost in connection with the Repricing Amendment in June 2018. INCOME TAXES. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was a tax expense of 23.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a tax expense of 27.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 . Compared to the U.S. statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 , the effective tax rate was increased by state taxes, foreign taxes, and nondeductible expenses and partially offset by research and development tax credits and other tax credits. Compared to the U.S. statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 , the effective tax rate was increased by state taxes, foreign taxes, and nondeductible expenses and partially offset by research and development tax credits and other tax credits. 23 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2018 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017 SALES. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $209.4 million , or 20.80% , to approximately $1.2 billion from $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. Sales from a business acquired on January 1, 2018 accounted for $47.5 million of the increase in sales. Excluding the 2018 sales of the business acquired, sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $161.9 million, or 16.1% from prior year's corresponding period. This sales increase is the result of an increase in our SC, IPS and SCS segments of $108.8 million, $87.6 million and $13.0 million, respectively. The fluctuations in sales is further explained in our business segment discussions below. Years Ended December 31 2018 2017 Change Change% Sales by Business Segment (in thousands, except change%) Service Centers $ 750,044 $ 641,275 $ 108,769 17.0 % Innovative Pumping Solutions 291,697 204,030 87,667 43.0 % Supply Chain Services 174,456 161,477 12,979 8.0 % Total DXP Sales $ 1,216,197 $ 1,006,782 $ 209,415 20.8 % Service Centers Segment. Sales for the Service Centers segment increased by $108.8 million , or 17.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Excluding $47.5 million of Service Centers segment sales for year ended December 31, 2018 from a business acquired, Service Centers segment sales for the period increased $61.3 million, or 9.6% from prior year's corresponding period. This sales increase is primarily the result of increased sales of rotating equipment, bearings and metal working products to customers engaged in the late upstream, midstream or downstream oil and gas markets or manufacturing equipment for these markets in connections with increased capital spending by oil and gas producers. If crude oil and natural gas prices and the drilling rig count remain at levels experienced during the year ended December 31, 2018, this level of sales to the oil and gas industry might continue, or improve, during 2019. Innovative Pumping Solutions Segment. Sales for the IPS segment increased by $87.7 million , or 43.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in capital spending by oil and gas producers and related businesses stemming from an increase in the drilling rig count and the price of oil during the year ended December 31, 2018. This level of IPS sales might continue, or improve, during 2019 if crude oil and natural gas prices and the drilling rig count remain at levels experienced during 2018. Supply Chain Services Segment. Sales for the SCS segment increased by $13.0 million , or 8.0% , for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in sales is primarily related to increased sales to customers in the oil and gas and aerospace industries. We suspect customers in the oilfield services and oilfield equipment manufacturing industries purchased more from DXP because of the increase in capital spending by oil and gas companies operating in the U.S. GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by approximately 34 basis points from the prior year's corresponding period. Excluding the impact of business acquired, gross profit as a percentage of sales increased by approximately 77 basis points. The increase in the gross profit percentage excluding the business acquired, is primarily the result of an approximate 314 basis points increase in the gross profit percentage in our IPS segment. These fluctuations are explained in the segment discussions below. Service Centers Segment. As a percentage of sales, the gross profit percentage for the Service Centers decreased approximately 24 basis points but increased approximately 61 basis points, adjusting for the business acquired, from the prior year's corresponding period. This was primarily as a result of sales mix and price increases from vendors. Operating income for the Service Centers segment increased $17.5 million, or 27.6%. The increase in operating income is primarily the result of the improved sales. Innovative Pumping Solutions Segment. As a percentage of sales, 2018 gross profit percentage for the IPS segment increased approximately 314 basis points from the prior year's corresponding period primarily as a result of increased utilization and capacity within IPS' engineered-to-order business and an overall improvement in the pricing environment driven by an increase in capital spending by oil and gas producers and a corresponding tightening in market conditions for IPS related work. Additionally, gross profit margins for individual orders have continued to improve because of the increase in sales of built to order customer specific products. Operating income for the IPS segment increased $22.5 million, or 197.1% , primarily as a result of the above mentioned increase in sales. 24 Table of Contents Supply Chain Services Segment. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 47 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the prior year's corresponding period. This was primarily as a result of sales mix and contractual lag effects of price increases from vendors. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 increase $0.8 million compared to the prior year's corresponding period mainly due to an increase in gross profit of $2.2 million primarily offset by an increase in SG&A of $1.5 million. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. Selling, general and administrative expense for year ended December 31, 2018 increased by approximately $25.7 million, or 10.8%, to $263.8 million from $238.1 million for prior year's corresponding period. Selling, general and administrative expense from a business that was acquired accounted for $3.0 million of the increase. Excluding the 2018 expenses from the business acquired, SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $22.7 million, or 9.5%. The overall increase in SG&A adjusting for the business acquired is the result of increased payroll, incentive compensation and related taxes and 401(k) expenses primarily due to increased headcount. The remaining increase in SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily a result of the increase in sales. As a percentage of sales, the year ended December 31, 2018 expense decreased 134 basis points to 22.3% from 23.6% for the prior year's corresponding period, adjusting for the business acquired, primarily as a result of the percentage increase in sales exceeding the percentage increase in SG&A. OPERATING INCOME. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $35.0 million, or 104.4%, to$68.5 million from $33.5 million in the prior year's corresponding period. The operating income from the business acquired in 2018 increased the overall operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 in the amount of $5.0 million. Excluding the operating income from the business acquired, operating income increased $30.0 million, or 89.5% from the prior year'scorresponding period. This increase in operating income is primarily related to the increase in sales discussed above. INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense for year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $3.9 million, or 22.8%, from prior year's corresponding period primarily as a result of increased interest rates and fees associated with the repricing of our credit facilities. Under our senior secured Term Loan B, DXP borrows at a spread over LIBOR. LIBOR increased 95 basis points from January through December 31, 2018. However, DXP repriced the Term Loan B on June 25, 2018 reducing the spread on LIBOR from 5.50% to 4.75%, reducing the impact of increases in LIBOR which DXP should benefit in fiscal 2019. INCOME TAXES. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was a tax expense of 27.1% for the year ended December 31,2018 compared to a tax expense of 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Compared to the U.S. statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2018, the effective tax rate was increased by state taxes, foreign taxes, and nondeductible expenses and partially offset by research and development tax credits and other tax credits. Compared to the U.S. statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2017, the effective tax rate was increased by state taxes and nondeductible expenses. The effective tax rate decreased because of the remeasurement of our net deferred income tax liabilities, lower income tax rates on income earned in foreign jurisdictions, the change in valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets, the reduction of tax rates used to establish deferred tax liabilities related to intangibles for customer relationships acquired in Canada in 2012 and 2013, research and development tax credits and domestic production activity deduction. Inflation We do not believe the effects of inflation have any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We attempt to minimize inflationary trends by passing manufacturer price increases on to the customer whenever practicable. The rate of inflation, as measured by changes in the producer price index, affects different commodities, the cost of products purchased and ultimately the pricing of our different products and product classes to our customers. Our pricing related to inflation did not have a measurable impact on our sales revenue for the year. Historically, price changes from suppliers have been consistent with inflation and have not had a material impact on the results of our operations. Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results of operations as determined by GAAP, we disclose non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures we provide in this report should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). Our primary non-GAAP financial measure is organic sales (Organic Sales) and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, net income/(loss), 25 Table of Contents diluted earnings per common share ( EPS ), or other measures prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. Management believes that presenting our non-GAAP financial measures ( i . e ., Organic Sales and EBITDA) is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Organic Sales is defined as net sales excluding, when they occur, the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Organic Sales is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. EBITDA is defined as the sum of consolidated net income in such period, plus to the extent deducted from consolidated net income: (i) income tax expense, (ii) franchise tax expense, (iii) consolidated interest expense, (iv) amortization and depreciation during such period, (v) all non-cash charges and adjustments, and (vi) non-recurring cash expenses related to the Term Loan; in addition to these adjustments, we exclude, when they occur, the impacts of impairment losses and losses/(gains) on the sale of a business. EBITDA is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures, to its most comparable GAAP financial measure is included below.

Fiscal 2019 is 100% organic. We use EBITDA internally to evaluate and manage the Company's operations because we believe it provides useful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing economic performance. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform more meaningful comparisons of operating results. 26 Table of Contents The following table set forth the reconciliation of EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP financial measure (in thousands) : Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 GAAP net income attributable to DXP Enterprises, Inc. $ 36,035 $ 35,632 $ 16,888 Loss attributable to non-controlling interest (260 ) (111 ) (359 ) Provision for income taxes 10,894 13,185 363 Depreciation and amortization 25,174 26,164 27,786 Interest expense 19,498 20,937 17,054 EBITDA $ 91,341 $ 95,807 $ 61,732 EBITDA margin as % of sales 7.2 % 7.9 % 6.1 % Liquidity and Capital Resources General Overview As of December 31, 2019 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $54.3 million and bank and other borrowings of $237.9 million . We have a $85 million Asset-Based Loan facility that is due to mature in August 2022, under which we had no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2019 . Our primary source of capital is cash flow from operations, supplemented as necessary by bank borrowings or other sources of debt. As a distributor of MRO products and services, we require significant amounts of working capital to fund inventories and accounts receivables. Additional cash is required for capital items for information technology, warehouse equipment, leasehold improvements, pump manufacturing equipment and safety services equipment. We also require cash to pay our lease obligations and to service our debt. The following table summarizes our net cash flows used in and provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash (used in) provided by financing activities for the periods presented ( in thousands ): Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Change Change(%) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 41,307 $ 35,840 $ 5,467 15 % Investing activities (22,085 ) (17,576 ) (4,509 ) 26 % Financing activities (6,092 ) (2,921 ) (3,171 ) 109 % Effect of foreign currency 676 (403 ) 1,079 (268 )% Net change in cash $ 13,806 $ 14,940 $ (1,134 ) (8 )% Operating Activities The Company generated $41.3 million of cash in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to generating of $35.8 million cash during the prior year's corresponding period. The $5.5 million increase in the amount of cash generated between the two periods was primarily driven by an increase in profitability that exceeded investments in working capital. Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2019 , net cash used in investing activities was $22.1 million compared to $17.6 million in the corresponding period in 2018 . This increase was primarily driven by purchases of property, plant and equipment of approximately $22.1 million compared to $9.3 million in the corresponding period in 2018 . This increase was partially offset by the cash component of the purchase of ASI for $10.8 million partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a building for $2.6 million in 2018 . Capital expenditures during 2019 were primarily related to building improvements, manufacturing equipment, and patterns. The maintenance capital expenditures for 2020 are expected to be within the range of $5 million to $10 million. 27 Table of Contents Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2019 , net cash used in financing activities was $6.1 million , compared to net cash generated by financing activities of $2.9 million for the corresponding period in 2018 . The activity in the period was primarily attributed to the Company making a payment for contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of ASI and higher principal repayments of debt in 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the amount available to be borrowed under our credit facility increased to $81.6 million compared to $79.3 million at December 31, 2018 . This was the result of a reduction in letters of credit outstanding to $3.4 million at December 31, 2019 , down from $5.7 million at December 31, 2018. We believe this is adequate funding to support working capital needs within the business. At December 31, 2019 , our total long-term debt, including the current portion, less principal repayments and less unamortized debt issuance fees, was $237.9 million , or 40.8% of total capitalization (total long-term debt including current portion plus shareholders equity) of $582.9 million . Approximately $244.4 million of this outstanding debt bears interest at various floating rates. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Free Cash Flow We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to fund acquisitions, make investments, repay debt obligations, repurchase company shares, and for certain other activities. Our free cash flow, which is calculated as cash provided by operations less net purchase of property and equipment, was $19.2 million , $29.1 million and $9.7 million for years 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. Free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow reconciles to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of cash flows from operations as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 41,307 $ 35,840 $ 12,544 Less: Purchase of property and equipment 22,120 9,323 2,811 Add: Proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment 35 2,558 Free cash flow $ 19,222 $ 29,075 $ 9,733 ABL Facility and Senior Secured Term Loan B Asset-Based Loan Facility: On August 29, 2017, DXP entered into a five year, $85.0 million Asset Based Loan and Security Agreement (the ABL Revolver ). The ABL Revolver provides for asset-based revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $85.0 million, subject to increase in certain circumstances. As of December 31, 2019 , there were no amounts of ABL Loans outstanding under the ABL Revolver. The Company's consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio was 2.92 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2019 . DXP was in compliance with all such covenants that were in effect on such date under the ABL Revolver as of December 31, 2019 . The ABL Credit Agreement may be increased in increments of $10.0 million up to an aggregate of $50.0 million. The facility will mature on August 29, 2022. Interest accrues on outstanding borrowings at a rate equal to LIBOR or CDOR plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75% per annum, or at an alternate base rate, Canadian prime rate or Canadian base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75% per annum, in each case, based upon the average daily excess availability under the facility for the most recently completed calendar quarter. Fees ranging from 0.25% to 0.375% per annum are payable on the portion of the facility not in use at any given time. The unused line fee was 0.375% at December 31, 2019 . 28 Table of Contents The interest rate for the ABL facility was 3.5% at December 31, 2019 . Term Loan B: The Term Loan B Agreement provides for a $250 million term loan (the Term Loan ) that amortizes in equal quarterly installments of 0.25% with the balance payable in August 2023, when the facility matures. Subject to securing additional lender commitments, the Term Loan B Agreement allows for incremental increases in facility size up to an aggregate of $30 million, plus an additional amount such that DXP Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Term Loan B Agreement) would not exceed 3.60 to 1.00. Interest accrues on the Term Loan at a rate equal to the base rate plus a margin of 3.75% for the Base Rate Loans (as defined in the Term Loan B Agreement), or LIBOR plus a margin of 4.75% for the Eurodollar Rate Loans (as defined in the Term Loan B Agreement). We are required to repay the Term Loan with certain asset sales and insurance proceeds, certain debt proceeds and 50% of excess cash flow, reducing to 25%, if our total leverage ratio is no more than 3.00 to 1.00 and 0%, if our total leverage ratio is no more than 2.50 to 1.00. The interest rate for the Term Loan was 6.5% as of December 31, 2019 . Financial Covenants: DXP principal financial covenants under the ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan B Agreement include: Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio under the ABL Credit Agreement is defined as the ratio for the most recently completed four-fiscal quarter period, of (a) EBITDA minus capital expenditures (excluding those financed or funded with debt (other than the ABL Loans), (ii) the portion thereof funded with the net proceeds from asset dispositions of equipment or real property which DXP is permitted to reinvest pursuant to the Term Loan and the portion thereof funded with the net proceeds of casualty insurance or condemnation awards in respect of any equipment and real estate which DXP is not required to use to prepay the ABL Loans pursuant to the Term Loan B Agreement or with the proceeds of casualty insurance or condemnation awards in respect of any other property) minus cash taxes paid (net of cash tax refunds received during such period), to (b) fixed charges. The Company is restricted from allowing its fixed charge coverage ratio be less than 1.00 to 1.00 during a compliance period, which is triggered when the availability under the ABL facility falls below a threshold set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company's consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio was 2.92 to 1.00. Secured Leverage Ratio The Term Loan B Agreement requires that the Company Secured Leverage Ratio, defined as the ratio, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of consolidated secured debt (net of unrestricted cash, not to exceed $30 million) as of such day to EBITDA, beginning with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2019 , is either equal to or less than as indicated in the table below: Fiscal Quarter Secured Leverage Ratio December 31, 2019 4.75:1.00 March 31, 2020 4.75:1.00 June 30, 2020 and each Fiscal Quarter thereafter 4.50:1.00 EBITDA as defined under the Term Loan B Agreement for financial covenant purposes means, without duplication, for any period of determination, the sum of, consolidated net income during such period; plus to the extent deducted from consolidated net income in such period: (i) income tax expense, (ii) franchise tax expense, (iii) consolidated interest expense, (iv) amortization and depreciation during such period, (v) all non-cash charges and adjustments, and (vi) non-recurring cash expenses related to the Term Loan, provided , that if the Company acquires or disposes of any property during such period (other than under certain exceptions specified in the Term Loan B Agreement, including the sale of inventory in the ordinary course of business, then EBITDA shall be calculated, after giving pro forma effect to such acquisition or disposition, as if such acquisition or disposition had occurred on the first day of such period. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio was 2.23 to 1.00. The ABL Loans and the Term Loan are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. 29 Table of Contents Borrowings (in thousands): December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Increase (Decrease) Current portion of long-term debt $ 2,500 $ 3,407 $ (907 ) Long-term debt, less debt issuance costs 235,419 236,979 (1,560 ) Total long-term debt 237,919 240,386 (2,467 ) We believe our cash generated from operations will meet our normal working capital needs during the next twelve months. However, we may require additional debt outside of our credit facilities or equity financing to fund potential acquisitions. Such additional financings may include additional bank debt or the public or private sale of debt or equity securities. In connection with any such financing, we may issue securities that substantially dilute the interests of our shareholders. Borrowing Capacity (in thousands): The following table summarizes the amount of borrowing capacity under our ABL Revolver as follows: December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Increase (Decrease) Total borrowing capacity $ 85,000 $ 85,000 $ Less : ABL Less : Outstanding letters of credit 3,442 5,679 (2,237 ) Total amount available $ 81,558 $ 79,321 $ 2,237 Contractual Obligations The impact that our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows ( in thousands ): Payments Due by Period Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Total Long-term debt, including current portion (1) $ 2,500 $ 5,000 $ 236,875 $ $ 244,375 Operating lease obligations 21,641 32,653 13,499 10,301 78,094 Estimated interest payments (2) 15,923 31,355 7,757 55,035 Total $ 40,064 $ 69,008 $ 258,131 $ 10,301 $ 377,504 (1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt and do not include any fair value adjustment. (2) Assumes interest rates in effect at December 31, 2019 . Assumes debt is paid on maturity date and not replaced. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities ("SPE's"), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2019 , we were not involved in any unconsolidated SPE transactions. The Company has not made any guarantees to customers or vendors nor does the Company have any off-balance sheet arrangements or commitments, that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the Company financial condition, change in financial condition, revenue, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Indemnification In the ordinary course of business, DXP enters into contractual arrangements under which DXP may agree to indemnify customers from any losses incurred relating to the services we perform. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnities have been immaterial. 30 Table of Contents DISCUSSION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Consolidated Financial Statements of DXPE are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( US GAAP ), which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of DXP. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates. Making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. A summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting and Business Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , which is incorporated herein by reference. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Receivables and Credit Risk Trade receivables consist primarily of uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms, which usually require payment within 30 days of the invoice date. However, these payment terms are extended in select cases and customers may not pay within stated trade terms. The Company has trade receivables from a diversified customer base located primarily in the Rocky Mountain, Northeastern, Midwestern, Southeastern and Southwestern regions of the United States, and Canada. The Company believes no significant concentration of credit risk exists. The Company evaluates the creditworthiness of its customers' financial positions and monitors accounts on a regular basis, but generally does not require collateral. Provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made monthly and adjustments are made periodically (as circumstances warrant) based upon management best estimate of the collectability of such accounts. The Company writes-off uncollectible trade accounts receivable when the accounts are determined to be uncollectible. No customer represents more than 10% of consolidated sales. Uncertainties require the Company to make frequent judgments and estimates regarding a customer ability to pay amounts due in order to assess and quantify an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts. The primary factors used to quantify the allowance are customer delinquency, bankruptcy, and the Company estimate of its ability to collect outstanding receivables based on the number of days a receivable has been outstanding. Many of the Company customers operate in the energy industry. The cyclical nature of the industry may affect customers operating performance and cash flows, which could impact the Company ability to collect on these obligations. The Company continues to monitor the economic climate in which its customers operate and the aging of its accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the aging of accounts and an individual assessment of each invoice. At December 31, 2019 , the allowance was approximately 4.6% of the gross accounts receivable remaining unchanged from a year earlier. While credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established, should actual write-offs differ from estimates, revisions to the allowance would be required. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Indefinite Intangible Assets The Company tests goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable . The Company assigns the carrying value of these intangible assets to its "reporting units" and applies the test for goodwill at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below a segment (a "component") if the component is a business and discrete information is prepared and reviewed regularly by segment management. 31 Table of Contents The Company goodwill impairment assessment first permits evaluating qualitative factors to determine if a reporting unit's carrying value would more likely than not exceed its fair value. If the Company concludes, based on the qualitative assessment, that a reporting unit's carrying value would more likely than not exceed its fair value, the Company would perform a quantitative test for that reporting unit. Goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit net assets including goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. For 2019 and 2018 , the Company annual tests of goodwill for impairment, including qualitative assessments of all of its reporting units of goodwill, determined that a quantitative analysis was not necessary. The Company determines fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiples analyses. These types of analyses contain uncertainties as they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgments regarding industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. The Company policy is to conduct impairment testing based on current business strategies, taking into consideration current industry and economic conditions, as well as the Company future expectations. Key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include, among others, discount rates, growth rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. Discount rates are determined using a weighted average cost of capital ( WACC ). The WACC considers market an industry data, as well as Company-specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used. The discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in a similar business. Management uses industry considerations and Company-specific historical and projected results to develop cash flow projections for each reporting unit. Additionally, as part of the market multiples approach, the Company utilizes market data from publicly traded entities whose businesses operate in industries comparable to the Company reporting units, adjusted for certain factors that increase comparability. The Company cannot predict the occurrence of events or circumstances that could adversely affect the fair value of goodwill. Such events may include, but are not limited to, deterioration of the economic environment, increase in the Company weighted average cost of capital, material negative changes in relationships with significant customers, reductions in valuations of other public companies in the Company industry, or strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions. If actual results are not consistent with the Company current estimates and assumptions, impairment of goodwill could be required. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Excluding Goodwill The Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. No impairment was recorded for property and equipment and intangible assets with indefinite or determinable lives during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Revenue Recognition In our Innovative Pumping Solutions segment, we make a substantial portion of our sales to customers pursuant to long-term contracts to fabricate tangible assets to customer specifications that can range from three to eighteen months or more. We account for these long-term contracts under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which is an input method as defined by ASC 606, Revenue Recognition . Under this method, we recognize sales and profit based upon the cost-to-cost method, in which sales and profit are recorded based upon the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs to complete the asset. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and, in some cases, includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications (change orders). Due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total contract costs and revenues through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several months. We are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements, complexity of design and related development costs, product performance, availability and cost of materials, labor productivity and cost, overhead, manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones, including product deliveries, technical requirements, or schedule. 32 Table of Contents Management performs detailed quarterly reviews of all of our open contracts. Based upon these reviews, we record the effects of adjustments in profit estimates each period. If at any time management determines that in the case of a particular contract total costs will exceed total contract revenue, we record a provision for the entire anticipated contract loss at that time. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different profit margins and/or cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. The percentage-of-completion method requires that we estimate future revenues and costs over the life of a contract. Revenues are estimated based upon the original contract price, with consideration being given to exercised contract options, change orders and in some cases projected customer requirements. Contract costs may be incurred over a period of several months, and the estimation of these costs requires significant judgment based upon the acquired knowledge and experience of program managers, engineers, and finance professionals. Estimated costs are based primarily on anticipated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. The complexity of certain designs as well as technical risks and uncertainty as to the future availability of materials and labor resources could affect the company's ability to accurately estimate future contract costs. Our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if (a) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment, (b) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation, (c) there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or (d) we are unable to meet contract milestones or product specifications. Management continues to monitor and update program cost estimates quarterly for all open contracts. A significant change in an estimate on several of these contracts could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. Purchase Accounting DXP estimates the fair value of assets, including property, machinery and equipment and their related useful lives and salvage values, intangibles and liabilities when allocating the purchase price of an acquisition. The fair value estimates are developed using the best information available. Third party valuation specialists assist in valuing the Company significant acquisitions. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including the income approach and the market approach. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. We typically engage an independent valuation firm to assist in estimating the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets. We do not expect that there will be material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to complete the purchase price allocation and estimate the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities for the acquisition completed in fiscal 2018. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Many of our acquisitions may include as additional compensation, contingent consideration. Contingent consideration is a financial liability recorded at fair value upon acquisition. The amount of contingent consideration to be paid is based on the occurrence of future events, such as the achievement of certain revenue or earnings milestones of the target after consummation. Accordingly, the estimate of fair value contains uncertainties as it involves judgment about the likelihood and timing of achieving these milestones as well as the discount rate used. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration obligation result from changes to the assumptions used to estimate the probability of success for each milestone, the anticipated timing of achieving the milestones and the discount period and rate to be applied. A change in any of these assumptions could produce a different fair value, which could have a material impact on the results from operations. The impact of changes in key assumptions is described in Note 5 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities . Income Taxes The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities. Such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to reverse. We are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, which may include net operating loss carryforwards, tax credits or temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years, will be recoverable from future taxable income. In making that assessment, we consider the nature of the deferred tax assets and related statutory limits on utilization, recent operating results, future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. If, based upon available evidence, recovery of the full amount of the deferred tax assets is not likely, we provide a valuation allowance on amounts not likely to be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change. Assessments are made at each balance sheet date to determine how much of each deferred tax asset is realizable. These estimates are subject to change in the future, particularly if earnings of 33 Table of Contents a particular subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected, or if management takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In the normal course of business, we are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and are periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges relate primarily to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. A position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Our effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if, upon final resolution with taxing authorities, we prevail on positions for which unrecognized tax benefits have been accrued, or are required to pay amounts in excess of accrued unrecognized tax benefits. The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U. S. federal, state and local tax examination by tax authorities for years prior to 2013. The Company's policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as operating expenses. The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on its tax returns and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Leases. In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) as modified by subsequently issued ASUs 2018-01, 2018-10, 2018-11 and 2018-20. The Company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2019. We have elected to apply the current period transition approach as introduced by ASU 2018-11 for our transition at January 1, 2019 and we have elected to apply several of the practical expedients in conjunction with accounting policy elections. See Note 4 - Leases for further discussion. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted Intangibles-Goodwill and Other . In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract based on a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) that requires implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements (CCAs) to be deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement, if those costs would be capitalized by the customer in a software licensing arrangement under the internal-use software guidance in ASC 350-40, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software . The ASU does not affect the accounting by cloud service providers, other software vendors or customers accounting for software licensing arrangements. The ASU will require companies to recognize deferred implementation costs to expense over the term of the hosting arrangement . Under the ASU, the term of the hosting arrangement comprises the non-cancellable period of the CCA plus any optional renewal periods that are reasonably certain to be exercised by the customer or for which exercise of the option is controlled by the vendor. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We will adopt the new standard beginning January 1, 2020. We do not anticipate that the new standard will have a material impact on our results of operations. Fair Value Measurement. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13: Fair Value Measurement: Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement which eliminates, adds and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements as part of its disclosure framework project. Entities will no longer be required to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, but public companies will be required to disclose the range and weighted average used to develop significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements. The guidance is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods within those fiscal years, but entities are permitted to early adopt either the entire standard or only the provisions that eliminate or modify the disclosure requirements. The new standard will not have an impact on our results of operations, but it will significantly modify our disclosures around fair value measurements. Financial Instruments Credit Losses. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13: Financial Instruments Credit Losses, which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current US GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit 34 Table of Contents losses ("CECL"). The update is intended to provide financial statement users with more useful information about expected credit losses. We do not currently hold most of the financial instruments contemplated by the new standard, with the exception of trade receivables and contract assets associated with custom built pump packages. CECL will become the single model to measure impairment on financial assets measured at amortized cost, which include trade receivables and contract assets under ASC 606. Therefore, consistent with other types of financial assets measured at amortized cost, estimates of expected credit losses on trade receivables and contract assets over their contractual life will be required to be recorded at inception, based on historical information, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Currently, our reserve methodology for trade receivables is based on matrices in which historical loss percentages are applied to respective aging categories. CECL will require us to use a forward-looking methodology that incorporates lifetime expected credit losses. While our current reserving matrices may still be used under CECL, historical loss data will need to be combined with reasonable and supportable forecasts of future losses to determine estimated credit losses. The most visible impact of CECL will therefore be that receivables and contract assets that are either current or not yet due, which today do not generally have a reserve, will have an allowance for expected credit losses. The CECL model does not prescribe a specific methodology for developing a reasonable and supportable forecast, nor the duration of the period that losses can be forecast, nor the precision required to support the estimate. As a result, the determination of the reasonable and supportable forecast period is a judgment to be made in estimating the overall expected credit loss. Although the CECL model requires entities to perform this new evaluation for trade receivables and contract assets, we generally do not expect to see a significant change in the impairment losses recognized on either our trade receivables or contract assets given their short-term nature. We will adopt the standard on January 1, 2020, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. Based upon our current assessment, the adjustment will be less than $3 million to our allowance for doubtful accounts and the company does not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material impact on the consolidated statement of operations and cash flows.
