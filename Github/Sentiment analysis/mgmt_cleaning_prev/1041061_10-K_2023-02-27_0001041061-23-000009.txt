Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Introduction and Overview The following Management Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A ), should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements ( Financial Statements ) in Item 8 and the Forward-Looking Statements and the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A. All Note references herein refer to the Notes to the Financial Statements. Tabular amounts are displayed in millions of U.S. dollars except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified. Percentages may not recompute due to rounding. Yum! Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as the Company , YUM , we , us or our ) franchise or operate a system of over 55,000 restaurants in more than 155 countries and territories, primarily under the concepts of KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and The Habit Burger Grill (collectively, the Concepts ). The Company KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut brands are global leaders of the chicken, Mexican-style food and pizza categories, respectively. The Habit Burger Grill is a fast-casual restaurant concept specializing in made-to-order chargrilled burgers, sandwiches and more. Of the over 55,000 restaurants, 98% are operated by franchisees. As of December 31, 2022, YUM consists of four operating segments: The KFC Division which includes our worldwide operations of the KFC concept The Taco Bell Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Taco Bell concept The Pizza Hut Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Pizza Hut concept The Habit Burger Grill Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Habit Burger Grill concept Through our Recipe for Good Growth we intend to unlock the growth potential of our Concepts and YUM, drive increased collaboration across our Concepts and geographies and consistently deliver better customer experiences, improved unit economics and higher rates of growth. Key enablers include accelerated use of digital and technology and better leverage of our systemwide scale. Our global citizenship and sustainability strategy is reflected in our Good agenda, which includes our priorities for social responsibility, risk management and sustainable stewardship of our people, food and planet. Our Growth agenda is based on four key drivers: Unrivaled Culture and Talent: Leverage our culture and people capability to fuel brand performance and franchise success Unmatched Operating Capability: Recruit and equip the best restaurant operators in the world to deliver great customer experiences Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands: Innovate and elevate iconic restaurant brands people trust and champion Bold Restaurant Development: Drive market and franchise expansion with strong economics and value We intend to drive long-term growth and shareholder returns primarily through consistent same-store sales growth and new unit development across all of our Concepts. We intend to support this growth and development through a capital and operating structure that: Invests capital in a manner consistent with an asset light, franchisor model; Allocates G&A in an efficient manner that provides leverage to operating profit growth while at the same time opportunistically investing in strategic growth initiatives; Pays a competitive dividend and returns excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases; and Targets a consolidated net leverage ratio that balances shareholder returns, cost of capital and flexibility against various risk factors. We intend for this MD&A to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our results of operations, including performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company performance. Throughout this MD&A, we commonly discuss the following performance metrics: 28 Same-store sales growth is the estimated percentage change in system sales of all restaurants that have been open and in the YUM system for one year or more (except as noted below), including those temporarily closed. From time-to-time restaurants may be temporarily closed due to remodeling or image enhancement, rebuilding, natural disasters, health epidemic or pandemic, landlord disputes or other issues. Throughout 2022, 2021 and 2020 we had a significant number of restaurants that were temporarily closed including restaurants closed due to government and landlord restrictions as a result of COVID-19. The system sales of restaurants we deem temporarily closed remain in our base for purposes of determining same-store sales growth and the restaurants remain in our unit count (see below). We believe same-store sales growth is useful to investors because our results are heavily dependent on the results of our Concepts existing store base. Additionally, same-store sales growth is reflective of the strength of our Brands, the effectiveness of our operational and advertising initiatives and local economic and consumer trends. In 2021 and 2020, when calculating respective same-store sales growth we also included in our prior year base the sales of stores that were added as a result of our acquisition of The Habit Restaurants, Inc. on March 18, 2020, and that were open for one year or more. Gross unit openings reflects new openings by us and our franchisees. Net new unit growth reflects gross unit openings offset by permanent store closures, by us and our franchisees. To determine whether a restaurant meets the definition of a unit we consider factors such as whether the restaurant has operations that are ongoing and independent from another YUM unit, serves the primary product of one of our Concepts, operates under a separate franchise agreement (if operated by a franchisee) and has substantial and sustainable sales. We believe gross unit openings and net new unit growth are useful to investors because we depend on new units for a significant portion of our growth. Additionally, gross unit openings and net new unit growth are generally reflective of the economic returns to us and our franchisees from opening and operating our Concept restaurants. System sales, System sales excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation ( FX ) and System sales excluding FX and the impact of the 53rd week in 2019 for our U.S. subsidiaries or certain international subsidiaries that operate on a weekly period calendar. System sales reflect the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company-owned and franchise restaurants. Sales at franchise restaurants typically generate ongoing franchise and license fees for the Company at a rate of 3% to 6% of sales. Increasingly, customers are paying a fee to a third party to deliver or facilitate the ordering of our Concepts products. We also include in System sales any portion of the amount customers pay these third parties for which the third party is obligated to pay us a license fee as a percentage of such amount. Franchise restaurant sales and fees paid by customers to third parties to deliver or facilitate the ordering of our Concepts products are not included in Company sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income; however, any resulting franchise and license fees we receive are included in the Company revenues. We believe System sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates our primary revenue drivers, Company and franchise same-store sales as well as net unit growth. As of the beginning of the second quarter of 2022, as a result of our progress towards exiting Russia and our decision to reclass future net profits attributable to Russia subsequent to the date of invasion from the Division segments in which those profits were earned to Unallocated Other income (see Notes 3 and 19), we elected to remove all Russia units from our unit count as well as to begin excluding those units associated sales from our system sales totals. We removed 1,112 units and 53 units in Russia from our global KFC and Pizza Hut unit counts, respectively. These units were treated similar to permanent store closures for purposes of our same-store sales calculations and thus they were removed from our same-store sales calculations beginning April 1, 2022. In addition to the results provided in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ), the Company provides the following non-GAAP measurements. Diluted Earnings Per Share excluding Special Items (as defined below); Effective Tax Rate excluding Special Items; Core Operating Profit and Core Operating Profit excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2019. Core Operating Profit excludes Special Items and FX and we use Core Operating Profit for the purposes of evaluating performance internally; Company restaurant profit and Company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales (as defined below). These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measurements provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. 29 Special Items are not included in any of our Division segment results as the Company does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature. Our chief operating decision maker does not consider the impact of Special Items when assessing segment performance. Company restaurant profit is defined as Company sales less Company restaurant expenses, both of which appear on the face of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Company restaurant expenses include those expenses incurred directly by our Company-owned restaurants in generating Company sales, including cost of food and paper, cost of restaurant-level labor, rent, depreciation and amortization of restaurant-level assets and advertising expenses incurred by and on behalf of that Company restaurant. Company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales ( Company restaurant margin % ) is defined as Company restaurant profit divided by Company sales. We use Company restaurant profit for the purposes of internally evaluating the performance of our Company-owned restaurants and we believe Company restaurant profit provides useful information to investors as to the profitability of our Company-owned restaurants. In calculating Company restaurant profit, the Company excludes revenues and expenses directly associated with our franchise operations as well as non-restaurant-level costs included in General and administrative expenses, some of which may support Company-owned restaurant operations. The Company also excludes restaurant-level asset impairment and closures expenses, which have historically not been significant, from the determination of Company restaurant profit as such expenses are not believed to be indicative of ongoing operations. Company restaurant profit and Company restaurant margin % as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in the industry. Certain performance metrics and non-GAAP measurements are presented excluding the impact of FX. These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We believe the elimination of the FX impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations. For 2019 we provided Core Operating Profit excluding the impact of the 53rd week and System sales excluding FX and the impact of the 53rd week to further enhance the comparability given the 53rd week that was part of our fiscal calendar in 2019. Results of Operations Summary All comparisons within this summary are versus the same period a year ago. Comparisons versus 2019, unless otherwise stated, include the impact of a 53rd week in 2019. For discussion of our results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020, refer to the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2022. 2022 financial highlights: % Change System Sales, ex FX Same-Store Sales Units GAAP Operating Profit Core Operating Profit KFC Division +6 +4 +3 (3) +5 Taco Bell Division +11 +8 +5 +12 +12 Pizza Hut Division +3 Even +4 Even +4 Worldwide +6 +4 +4 +2 +6 Additionally: As of the beginning of the second quarter, we elected to remove 1,165 Russia units from our unit count and begin excluding their associated sales from our total system sales. We removed 1,112 units and 53 units in Russia from our KFC and Pizza Hut units counts, respectively. As a result: YUM and KFC Division year-over-year unit growth as shown above were negatively impacted by two and four percentage points, respectively. YUM and KFC Division system sales growth excluding foreign currency as shown above were negatively impacted by two and three percentage points, respectively. Also, we elected to reclass future net profits attributable to Russia subsequent to the date of invasion from the Division segments in which those profits were earned to Unallocated Other income and reflected such profits as a Special Item 30 as they are not indicative of our ongoing results. As a result of the decline in Core Operating Profits attributable to Russia: YUM and KFC Division Core Operating Profit as shown above were negatively impacted by two and four percentage points, respectively. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted Divisional Operating Profit by $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 2022 2021 % Change GAAP EPS $4.57 $5.21 (12) Special Items EPS $0.06 $0.75 NM EPS Excluding Special Items $4.51 $4.46 +1 In addition to the aforementioned factors impacting Operating Profit, our diluted EPS, excluding Special Items, was also impacted by lower Investment income, net year over year. Investment income, net added approximately $0.03 and $0.26 to our diluted EPS, excluding Special Items for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, Gross unit openings for the year were 4,560 units resulting in 3,076 net new units.

As such, refranchising gains and losses recorded as Special Items are directly associated with restaurants that were refranchised prior to the end of 2018. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded net refranchising gains of $6 million, $3 million and $8 million, respectively, that have been reflected as Special Items. 33 Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded net refranchising gains of $21 million, $32 million and $26 million, respectively, that have not been reflected as Special Items. These gains relate to refranchising of restaurants that were not part of our aforementioned plans to achieve 98% franchise ownership and that we believe are now more indicative of our expected ongoing refranchising activity. (b) In the first quarter of 2022, as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we suspended all investment and restaurant development in Russia. We also suspended all operations of our 70 company-owned KFC restaurants in Russia and began finalizing an agreement to suspend all Pizza Hut operations in Russia, in partnership with our master franchisee. Further, we pledged to redirect any future net profits attributable to Russia subsequent to the date of invasion to humanitarian efforts. During the second quarter, we completed the transfer of ownership of the Pizza Hut Russia business to a local operator who has initiated the process of re-branding locations to a non-YUM concept. In October 2022, we announced that we entered into a sale and purchase agreement to transfer ownership of our KFC Russia restaurants, operating system and master franchise rights, including the network of KFC franchised restaurants, to Smart Service Ltd., a business operated by one of our existing KFC franchisees in Russia. Under the agreement, the buyer will be responsible for re-branding locations to a non-YUM concept and retaining the Company employees in Russia. Completion of the transaction is subject to regulatory and governmental approvals, as well as other conditions. Following the completion of the transaction, we will have ceased our corporate presence in Russia. Our GAAP operating results presented herein reflect revenues from and expenses to support the Russian operations for Pizza Hut, prior to the date of transfer, and KFC, for the entirety of the year ended December 31, 2022, within their historical financial statement line items and operating segments. However, given our decision to exit Russia and our pledge to direct any future net profits attributable to Russia subsequent to the date of invasion to humanitarian efforts, we reclassed such resulting net profits from the Division segment results in which they were earned to Unallocated Other income. Additionally, we have incurred certain expenses related to the transfer of the businesses and other one-time costs related to our exit from Russia which we have recorded within Corporate and unallocated G&A and Unallocated Franchise and property expenses. Also recorded in Unallocated Other income were foreign exchange gains attributable to fluctuations in the value of the Russian ruble. The resulting net Operating Profit from these items of $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 has been reflected as a Special Item as the amount is not indicative of our ongoing results. (c) Tax (Expense) Benefit on Special Items was determined based upon the impact of the nature, as well as the jurisdiction of the respective individual components within Special Items. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we also recorded as a Special Item an $8 million tax benefit related to prior refranchisings for which the associated pre-tax gain or loss was recorded as Special. (d) In December of 2019, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property ( IP ) rights. As a result of the transfer of certain of these rights, largely to subsidiaries in the United Kingdom ( UK ), we received a step-up in tax basis to current fair value under applicable UK law, and to the extent this step-up in tax basis was amortizable against future taxable income, we recognized deferred tax assets. The associated deferred tax benefit was originally recognized as a Special Item in 2019. On July 22, 2020, the UK Finance Act 2020 was enacted resulting in an increase in the UK corporate tax rate from 17% to 19%. As a result, we remeasured the related deferred tax assets originally recorded as described above and recognized an additional $25 million deferred tax benefit as a Special Item in the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, we recognized a related deferred tax benefit of $3 million as a result of an increase in the step-up in the tax basis as described above as a Special Item in the year ended December 31, 2020. On June 10, 2021, the UK Finance Act 2021 was enacted resulting in an increase in the UK corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25%. As a result, we remeasured the related deferred tax assets originally recorded as described above and recognized an additional $64 million deferred tax benefit as a Special Item in the year ended December 31, 2021. In July 2021, we concentrated management responsibility for European (excluding the UK) KFC franchise development, support operations and management oversight in Switzerland (the KC Europe Reorganization ). Concurrent with this change in management responsibility, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain KFC IP rights from subsidiaries in the UK to subsidiaries in Switzerland. With the transfer of these rights, we received a step-up in amortizable tax basis to current fair value under applicable Swiss tax law. As a result of this transfer, we recorded a net, one-time benefit of $152 million as a Special Item in the year ended December 31, 2021. In December 2021, we continued our KFC Europe Reorganization and completed intra-entity transfers of additional European KFC IP rights from subsidiaries in the U.S. to subsidiaries in Switzerland. With the transfers of these additional 34 rights, we received a step-up in amortizable tax basis to current fair value under applicable Swiss tax law. As a result of this transfer, we recorded a net one-time tax benefit of $35 million as a Special Item in the year ended December 31, 2021. In the quarter ended June 30, 2022, as a result of our decision to exit the Russia market, we recorded tax expense associated with the remeasurement of and establishment of a valuation allowance on a portion of the aforementioned deferred tax assets associated with the amortizable tax basis associated with the KFC IP rights held in Switzerland (see Note e). In the quarter ended December 31, 2022, we performed an annual valuation under Swiss laws of these Swiss IP rights, incorporating current assumptions around the expected future cash flows attributable to the IP. This valuation supported an increase to tax basis of Swiss IP rights associated with parts of our business that will continue to use these IP rights due to expected royalty growth assumptions in those parts of the business that largely offset the loss of the Russia royalty income associated with such IP rights. Based on this valuation as well as future forecasting of taxable income, we remeasured and reassessed the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets associated with the Swiss IP. As a result, we recorded a net tax benefit of $82 million as a Special Item in the quarter ended December 31, 2022. (e) Our decision to exit the Russia market in the quarter ended June 30, 2022, resulted in a reduction in the tax basis of KFC IP rights held in Switzerland due to the expected loss of the Russia royalty income associated with such rights going forward. As a result, we remeasured and reassessed the need for a valuation allowance on the associated deferred tax assets. In addition, we reassessed certain deferred tax liabilities associated with the Russia business given the expectation that the existing basis difference will now reverse by way of sale. Primarily as a result of these items, we recorded a net tax expense of $72 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, that was reflected as a Special Item.

See also the Detail of Special Items section of this MD&A for other items similarly impacting results. Russia Invasion of Ukraine In the first quarter of 2022, as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we suspended all investment and restaurant development in Russia. We also suspended all operations of our 70 company-owned KFC restaurants in Russia and began finalizing an agreement to suspend all Pizza Hut operations in Russia, in partnership with our master franchisee. Further, we pledged to redirect any future net profits attributable to Russia subsequent to the date of invasion to humanitarian efforts. During the second quarter, we completed the transfer of ownership of the Pizza Hut Russia business to a local operator who has initiated the process of re-branding locations to a non-YUM concept. In October 2022, we announced that we entered into a sale and purchase agreement to transfer ownership of our KFC Russia restaurants, operating system and master franchise rights, including the network of KFC franchised restaurants, to Smart Service Ltd., a business operated by one of our existing KFC franchisees in Russia. Under the agreement, the buyer will be responsible for re-branding locations to a non-YUM concept and retaining the Company employees in Russia. Completion of the transaction is subject to regulatory and governmental approvals, as well as other conditions agreed to by the parties. Following the completion of the transaction, we will have ceased our corporate presence in Russia. As of the beginning of the second quarter of 2022, we elected to remove all Russia units from our unit count and their associated sales from our total system sales. We removed 1,112 units and 53 units in Russia from our global KFC and Pizza Hut units counts, respectively. This negatively impacted YUM and KFC Division year-over-year unit growth by two and four percentage points, respectively at December 31, 2022. This also negatively impacted our system sales growth excluding foreign currency for YUM and KFC Division by two and three percentage points, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2022. Russia units were removed from our same-store sales calculations as of the beginning of the second quarter. Our GAAP operating results presented herein reflect revenues from and expenses to support the Russian operations for Pizza Hut, prior to the date of transfer, and KFC, for the entirety of the year ended December 31, 2022, within their historical financial statement line items and operating segments. However, given our decision to exit Russia and our pledge to direct any future net profits attributable to Russia subsequent to the date of invasion to humanitarian efforts, we reclassed such resulting net profits from the Division segment results in which they were earned to Unallocated Other income and reflected such net profits as a Special Item. Additionally, we have incurred certain expenses related to the transfer of the businesses and other costs related to our exit from Russia which we have recorded within Corporate and unallocated. The resulting net Operating 37 Profit of $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 has been reflected as a Special Item as the amount is not indicative of our ongoing results. Historically, our Russian business has constituted approximately 3% of our total Operating Profit and 2% of our total system sales. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our Core Operating Profits in Russia declined versus the prior year, negatively impacting YUM and KFC Division Core Operating Profit growth by two and four percentage points, respectively. Our Core Operating Profit growth in the first and second quarters of 2023 will also be negatively impacted as we lap the 2022 Russia results that remained in Core Operating Profit. We expect YUM and KFC Division Core Operating Profit growth to be negatively impacted by approximately one and two percentage points, respectively, in both the first and second quarters of 2023 due to this lap. Impact of Foreign Currency Translation on Operating Profit Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted the translation of our foreign currency denominated Divisional Operating Profit by $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This included a negative impact to our KFC Division Operating Profit of $98 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. For 2023, we currently expect changes in foreign currency to negatively impact Divisional Operating Profit by approximately $30 to $40 million, primarily in the first half of the year. COVID-19 In late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was first detected and in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. As a result of COVID-19, governmental authorities around the world implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These measures have included, and in some instances continue to include, restrictions on travel outside the home and limitations on business and other activities as well as encouraging social distancing. As a result of COVID-19, we and our franchisees experienced significant store closures and instances of reduced store-level operations, including reduced operating hours and dining-room closures. The impact on our sales in each of our markets has been dependent on the timing, severity and duration of the outbreak, measures implemented by government authorities to reduce the spread of COVID-19, as well as our reliance on dine-in sales in the market. Throughout 2022, COVID-19 outbreaks and resulting government restrictions limiting mobility continued to impact sales in a few key markets, primarily in China. Excluding China, our YUM same-store sales growth was 7% and our KFC Division same-store sales growth was 9% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The COVID-19 situation is ongoing, and its dynamic nature makes it difficult to forecast any impacts on the Company 2023 results. Investment in Devyani In 2020, we received an approximate 5% minority interest in Devyani International Limited ( Devyani ), an entity that owns our KFC India and Pizza Hut India master franchisee rights. The minority interest was received in lieu of cash proceeds upon the refranchising of approximately 60 KFC restaurants in India. At the time of the refranchisings, the fair value of this minority interest was estimated to be approximately $31 million. On August 16, 2021, Devyani executed an initial public offering and subsequently the fair value of this investment became readily determinable. As a result, concurrent with the initial public offering we began recording changes in fair value in Investment (income) expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income and recognized pre-tax investment income of $11 million and $87 million, in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 38 KFC Division The KFC Division has 27,760 units, 86% of which are located outside the U.S. Additionally, 99% of the KFC Division units were operated by franchisees as of the end of 2022. % B/(W) % B/(W) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2020 Reported Ex FX Reported Ex FX System Sales $ 31,116 $ 31,365 $ 26,289 (1) 6 19 16 Same-Store Sales Growth (Decline) % 4 % 11 % (9) % N/A N/A N/A N/A Company sales $ 491 $ 596 $ 506 (18) (11) 18 12 Franchise and property revenues 1,645 1,557 1,295 6 12 20 17 Franchise contributions for advertising and other services 698 640 471 9 16 36 30 Total revenues $ 2,834 $ 2,793 $ 2,272 1 8 23 18 Company restaurant profit $ 65 $ 106 $ 67 (39) (33) 58 48 Company restaurant margin % 13.2 % 17.7 % 13.2 % (4.5) ppts.

As discussed in the Introduction and Overview section of this MD&A, all units in Russia, both Company and franchised, were removed from our same-store sales calculations beginning April 1, 2022. In 2022, the decrease in Company restaurant margin percentage was driven by commodity and wage inflation. Franchise and property revenues In 2022, the increase in Franchise and property revenues, excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, was driven by franchise same-store sales growth of 4% and unit growth. As discussed in the Introduction and Overview section of this MD&A, all units in Russia, both Company and franchised, were removed from our same-store sales calculations beginning April 1, 2022. G&A In 2022, the increase in G&A, excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, was driven by higher headcount and salaries and higher travel related costs, partially offset by lower expenses related to our annual incentive compensation program. 39 Operating Profit In 2022, the increase in Operating Profit, excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, was driven by same-store sales growth and unit growth, partially offset by the negative impact of 4 percentage points on year-over-year operating profit growth as a result of lower profits in Russia, higher restaurant operating costs, and higher G&A. Taco Bell Division The Taco Bell Division has 8,218 units, 88% of which are in the U.S. The Company owned 6% of the Taco Bell units in the U.S. as of the end of 2022. % B/(W) % B/(W) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2020 Reported Ex FX Reported Ex FX System Sales $ 14,653 $ 13,280 $ 11,745 10 11 13 13 Same-Store Sales Growth (Decline) % 8 % 11 % (1) % N/A N/A N/A N/A Company sales $ 1,002 $ 944 $ 882 6 6 7 7 Franchise and property revenues 837 742 662 13 13 12 12 Franchise contributions for advertising and other services 598 552 487 8 8 14 14 Total revenues $ 2,437 $ 2,238 $ 2,031 9 9 10 10 Company restaurant profit $ 236 $ 225 $ 225 5 5 Company restaurant margin % 23.6 % 23.9 % 25.5 % (0.3) ppts.

In 2022, the decrease in Company restaurant margin percentage was driven by commodity and wage inflation partially offset by same-store sales growth. Franchise and property revenues In 2022, the increase in Franchise and property revenues was driven by franchise same-store sales growth of 8% and unit growth. G&A In 2022, the increase in G&A, excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, was driven by higher headcount and salaries and higher travel related costs partially offset by lower charitable contributions. 40 Operating Profit In 2022, the increase in Operating Profit was driven by same-store sales growth and unit growth partially offset by higher restaurant operating costs and higher G&A. Pizza Hut Division The Pizza Hut Division has 19,034 units, 66% of which are located outside the U.S. Over 99% of the Pizza Hut Division units were operated by franchisees as of the end of 2022. The Pizza Hut Division uses multiple distribution channels including delivery, dine-in and express (e.g. airports) and includes units operating under both the Pizza Hut and Telepizza brands. % B/(W) % B/(W) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2020 Reported Ex FX Reported Ex FX System Sales $ 12,853 $ 12,955 $ 11,955 (1) 3 8 6 Same-Store Sales Growth (Decline) % Even 7 % (6) % N/A N/A N/A N/A Company sales $ 21 $ 46 $ 76 (55) (55) (40) (42) Franchise and property revenues 607 597 552 2 5 8 6 Franchise contributions for advertising and other services 376 385 374 (2) (1) 3 2 Total revenues $ 1,004 $ 1,028 $ 1,002 (2) 3 1 Company restaurant profit $ $ 3 $ 3 NM NM (19) (24) Company restaurant margin % (2.2) % 6.8 % 5.1 % (9.0) ppts.

Franchise and property revenues In 2022, the increase in Franchise and property revenues, excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, was driven by unit growth and the recognition of franchise fees related to unexercised development rights arising from a master franchise agreement. G&A In 2022, the increase in G&A, excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, was driven by higher headcount and salaries and higher travel related expenses, partially offset by lower professional fees and lower expenses related to our annual incentive compensation programs. 41 Operating Profit In 2022, the increase in Operating Profit, excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, was driven by unit growth. Habit Burger Grill Division The Habit Burger Grill Division has 349 units, the vast majority of which are in the U.S. The Company owned 85% of the Habit Burger Grill units in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. % B/(W) % B/(W) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2020 Reported Ex FX Reported Ex FX System Sales $ 661 $ 588 $ 370 12 12 59 59 Same-Store Sales Growth (Decline) % (1) % 16 % N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Total revenues $ 567 $ 525 $ 347 8 8 51 51 Operating Profit (Loss) $ (24) $ 2 $ (22) NM NM 111 111 % Increase (Decrease) Unit Count 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 Franchise 63 42 34 50 24 Company-owned 286 276 253 4 9 Total 349 318 287 10 11 Corporate & Unallocated % B/(W) (Expense)/Income 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 Corporate and unallocated G&A $ (297) $ (260) $ (312) (14) 17 Unallocated Franchise and property expenses (6) 1 (4) NM 115 Unallocated Refranchising gain (loss) (See Note 5) 27 35 34 (22) 2 Unallocated Other income (expense) 52 (14) (146) NM NM Investment income (expense), net (See Note 5) 11 86 74 (88) 16 Other pension income (expense) (See Note 15) (9) (7) (14) (26) 48 Interest expense, net (527) (544) (543) 3 Income tax provision (See Note 18) (337) (99) (116) (242) 15 Effective tax rate (See Note 18) 20.3 % 5.9 % 11.4 % (14.4) ppts. 5.5 ppts. Corporate and unallocated G&A In 2022, the increase in Corporate and Unallocated G&A expenses was driven by higher headcount and salaries including personnel associated with our 2021 investments in digital and technology companies and expenses related to the divestiture of our Russia businesses, partially offset by lower current year expenses due to our annual incentive compensation programs. Unallocated Other income (expense) Unallocated Other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2022, includes Russia net operating profits of $44 million reclassed from KFC and Pizza Hut Division Other income due to our decision to exit Russia (see Note 19). 42 Interest expense, net The decrease in Interest expense, net for 2022 was primarily driven by $12 million of previously unamortized debt issuance costs written-off in the prior year due to the refinancing of our Credit Agreement and $6 million lower expense in the current year relating to the call premium and previously unamortized debt issuance costs written-off associated with the redemption of the 2025 Notes as compared to the call premium and previously unamortized debt issuance costs written-off associated with the redemption of the 2026 Notes (as discussed in our 2021 Form 10-K) in the prior year. The impact on Interest expense, net of higher borrowings was offset by a lower weighted-average interest rate on those borrowings. Consolidated Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,427 million in 2022 versus $1,706 million in 2021. The decrease was largely driven by an increase in incentive compensation payments, timing of spending on advertising and an increase in income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities was $202 million in 2022 versus $173 million in 2021. The change was primarily driven by higher current year capital spending and lapping proceeds from our prior year sale of certain mutual fund investments, partially offset by the lapping of our prior year acquisition of Dragontail Systems Limited. Net cash used in financing activities was $1,323 million in 2022 versus $1,767 million in 2021. The change was primarily driven by lower share repurchases and higher current year net borrowings. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically generated substantial cash flows from our extensive franchise operations, which require a limited YUM investment, and from the operations of our Company-owned stores. Our annual operating cash flows have been in excess of $1.3 billion in each of the past four years and we expect that to continue to be the case in 2023. It is our intent to use these operating cash flows to continue to invest in growing our business and pay a competitive dividend, with any remaining excess then returned to shareholders through share repurchases. To the extent operating cash flows plus other sources of cash do not cover our anticipated cash needs, we maintain a $1.25 billion Revolving Facility under our Credit Agreement (see Note 11) which had $279 million outstanding as of December 31, 2022. We believe that our ongoing cash from operations, cash on hand, which was approximately $375 million at December 31, 2022, and availability under our Revolving Facility will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements over the next twelve months. Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations. Debt Obligations and Interest Payments As of December 31, 2022, approximately 94%, including the impact of interest rate swaps, of our $11.6 billion of total debt outstanding, excluding the Revolving Facility balance, finance leases and debt issuance costs and discounts, is fixed with an effective overall interest rate of approximately 4.4%. We ended 2022 with a consolidated net leverage ratio of 5.0x EBITDA. We continually reassess our optimal leverage ratio to maximize shareholder returns. We target a capital structure which we believe provides an attractive balance between optimized interest rates, duration and flexibility with diversified sources of liquidity and maturities spread over multiple years. We have credit ratings of BB (Standard & Poor s)/Ba2 (Moody s) with a balance sheet consistent with highly-levered peer restaurant franchise companies. 43 The following table summarizes the future maturities of our outstanding long-term debt, excluding finance leases and debt issuance costs and discounts, as of December 31, 2022. 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2037 2043 Total Securitization Notes $ 39 $ 39 $ 39 $ 944 $ 875 $ 582 $ 565 $ 7 $ 682 $ 3,772 Credit Agreement 34 48 53 662 15 1,398 2,210 Revolving Facility 279 279 Subsidiary Senior Unsecured Notes 750 750 YUM Senior Unsecured Notes 325 800 1,050 $ 2,100 $ 325 $ 275 4,875 Total $ 398 $ 87 $ 92 $ 1,885 $ 1,640 $ 1,980 $ 565 $ 807 $ 1,732 $ 2,100 $ 325 $ 275 $ 11,886 Interest payments on the outstanding long-term debt in the table above total approximately $3.6 billion, with approximately $500 million due within the next twelve months on the outstanding amounts on a nominal basis. The estimated interest payments related to the variable rate portion of our debt, net of our interest rate swaps, are based on current LIBOR interest rates. See Note 11 for details on the Securitization Notes, the Credit Agreement, Subsidiary Senior Unsecured Notes and YUM Senior Unsecured Notes. Operating and Finance Leases Payments required under our operating and finance leases total $1,131 million, of which $126 million is payable within the next 12 months. These amounts are on a nominal basis and include payments related to lease renewal options we are reasonably certain to exercise. These leases relate primarily to approximately 650 Company-owned restaurants and approximately 250 leased restaurants for which we sublease land, building or both to our franchisees. See Note 12. Capital Expenditures We remain committed to maintaining our asset light, franchisor model that includes at least a 98% franchise mix. Our allocation strategy for capital expenditures includes: Run-rate capital expenditures consisting of company restaurant repairs, maintenance and remodels, support of our digital and technology initiatives and project-specific capital expenditures, Targeted new company unit development to spur additional growth that is largely funded through refranchising a comparable number of existing company units, and Strategic investments that create incremental value for shareholders and franchisees. In 2023, we expect that company store investments will exceed refranchising proceeds by $55 to $65 million, primarily driven by our strategy to accelerate growth of Habit Burger Grill company units and continued investments in Taco Bell company restaurants. This will result in net capital expenditures of approximately $275 million, reflecting up to $315 million of gross capital expenditures and $40 million of refranchising proceeds. Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. We have excluded agreements that are cancellable without penalty. Our purchase obligations relate primarily to marketing, information technology and supply agreements. We have purchase obligations of approximately $425 million at December 31, 2022, with approximately $225 million due within the next 12 months. In addition to our contractual and other obligations, we seek to pay a competitive dividend and return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases. As discussed in Note 20, we are also subject to claims and contingencies related to certain tax and legal matters that may require future cash outlays. 44 Dividends and Share Repurchases In February 2023, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.605 per share of Common Stock, a 6% increase from the quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share of Common Stock paid in 2022. This quarterly dividend will be distributed March 10, 2023 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 22, 2023, and will total approximately $170 million. In September 2022, our Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $2 billion (excluding applicable transaction fees) of our outstanding Common Stock through June 30, 2024. This authorization took effect during the fourth quarter of 2022 upon the exhaustion of a prior authorization approved in May 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we have remaining capacity to repurchase up to $1.75 billion of Common Stock under the September 2022 authorization. This authorization does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Contingencies As discussed in Note 20, as a result of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) for fiscal years 2013 through 2015, in August 2022, we received a Revenue Agent Report ( RAR ) from the IRS asserting an underpayment of tax of $2.1 billion plus $418 million in penalties for the 2014 fiscal year. Additionally, interest on the underpayment is estimated to be approximately $780 million through December 31, 2022. The proposed underpayment relates primarily to a series of reorganizations we undertook during that year in connection with the business realignment of our corporate and management reporting structure along brand lines. The IRS asserts that these transactions resulted in taxable distributions of approximately $6.0 billion. We disagree with the IRS position as asserted in the RAR and intend to contest that position vigorously. In September 2022, we filed a Protest with the IRS Examination Division disputing on multiple grounds the proposed underpayment of tax and penalties. We are awaiting the IRS Examination Division Rebuttal to our Protest. When that Rebuttal is filed, we intend to pursue independent review by the IRS Office of Appeals. Also, as discussed in Note 20, on January 29, 2020, we received an order from the Special Director of the Directorate of Enforcement ( DOE ) in India imposing a penalty on Yum! Restaurants India Private Limited ( YRIPL ) of approximately Indian Rupee 11 billion, or approximately $135 million, primarily relating to alleged violations of operating conditions imposed in 1993 and 1994. We have been advised by external counsel that the order is flawed and have filed a writ petition with the Delhi High Court, which granted an interim stay of the penalty order on March 5, 2020. In November 2022, YRIPL was notified that an administrative tribunal bench had been constituted to hear an appeal by DOE of certain findings of the January 2020 order, including claims that certain charges had been wrongly dropped and that an insufficient amount of penalty had been imposed. A hearing has been scheduled with the administrative tribunal on March 14, 2023. The stay order remains in effect, and the next hearing in the Delhi High Court is scheduled for May 16, 2023. We deny liability and intend to continue vigorously defending this matter. See the Lease Guarantees section of Note 20 for discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition. Changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition and cash flows in future years. A description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows. Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived assets of restaurants we intend to continue operating as Company restaurants (primarily PP&E, right-of-use operating lease assets and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization) annually for impairment, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable. We evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant forecasted undiscounted cash flows, which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants. For restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable, we write-down the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value. Key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future after-tax cash flows of the restaurant, which are reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay, and a discount rate. The after-tax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the 45 restaurant. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions. In each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 our primary indicator of potential impairment for our restaurant assets was two consecutive years of operating losses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic this indicator was expanded to include restaurants that were open less than two years with cumulative operating losses for the last year or cumulative operating losses since the store open date if open less than one year. We perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level when it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group. Expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer, if available, or anticipated bids given the discounted projected after-tax cash flows for the group of restaurants. Historically, these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received. The after-tax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets. These after-tax cash flows also include a deduction for the anticipated, future royalties we would receive under a franchise agreement with terms substantially at market entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction. The discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related long-lived assets. The discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows. We evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist. Fair value is an estimate of the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset and is generally estimated by discounting the expected future after-tax cash flows associated with the intangible asset. Our most significant indefinite-lived intangible asset is our Habit Burger Grill brand asset with a book value of $96 million at December 31, 2022. As of our fourth quarter 2022 annual impairment testing date, the fair values of all of our indefinite-lived intangible assets were in excess of their respective carrying values and no impairment was recorded. Impairment of Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying values. Our reporting units are our business units (which are aligned based on geography) in our KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Habit Burger Grill Divisions. Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit, and is generally estimated using discounted expected future after-tax cash flows from franchise royalties and Company-owned restaurant operations, if any. Future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit. Future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth (from net new units or same-store sales growth) and margin improvement (for those reporting units which include Company-owned restaurant operations) assumptions that we believe a third-party buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit. Any margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated with sales growth as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives. The discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a third-party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit. We believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows. The fair values of all our reporting units with goodwill balances were in excess of their respective carrying values as of our fourth quarter 2022 goodwill testing date. As it relates to our Habit Burger Grill reporting unit, which includes a goodwill balance of $66 million as of the end of 2022, the assumptions that are most impactful to our fair value estimate include future average unit volumes ( AUVs ) and restaurant unit counts. As of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2022, the date of our annual impairment assessment, Habit forecasted results for these key assumptions have improved from those relied upon in our March 31, 2020 interim impairment test (see Note 5), including actual unit closures following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic being lower and AUVs recovering to pre COVID levels faster than assumed in that interim impairment test. When we refranchise restaurants, we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit 46 that will be retained. The fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee, which include a deduction for the anticipated, future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction. Appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value determinations if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates. When determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world. The Company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the Company and franchisee share in the impact of near-term fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the long-term the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties. The discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the Company. The Company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising. Others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction. During 2022, refranchising activity completed by the Company was limited and the write-off of goodwill associated with these transactions was approximately $5 million. Pension Plans Certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans. Our two most significant plans are in the U.S. and combined had a projected benefit obligation ( PBO ) of $755 million and a fair value of plan assets of $664 million at December 31, 2022. The PBO reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels. Due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid, our PBOs are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates. For our U.S. plans, we measured our PBOs using a discount rate of 5.60% at December 31, 2022. The primary basis for this discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated Aa or higher by Moody or Standard & Poor ( S&P ) with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans. We exclude from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by Moody or S&P for a potential downgrade (if the potential downgrade would result in a rating below Aa by both Moody and S&P) and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean. In considering possible bond portfolios, the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit payment cash flows for that year. Such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one-year forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year. The weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate. We also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary. A 50 basis-point increase in this discount rate would have decreased these U.S. plans PBOs by approximately $41 million at our measurement date. Conversely, a 50 basis-point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our U.S. plans PBOs by approximately $46 million at our measurement date. The net periodic benefit cost we will record in 2023 is also impacted by the discount rate, as well as the long-term rates of return on plan assets and mortality assumptions we selected at our measurement date. We expect net periodic benefit income for our U.S. plans of $4 million in 2023 compared to $9 million of periodic benefit cost in 2022, which represents an improvement of $13 million year-over-year. A 50 basis-point change in our discount rate assumption at our 2022 measurement date would impact our 2023 U.S. net periodic benefit cost by approximately $6 million. The impacts of changes in net periodic benefit costs are reflected primarily in Other pension (income) expense. Our estimated long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is based upon the weighted-average of historical and expected future returns for each asset category. Our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets, for purposes of determining 2023 pension expense, at December 31, 2022, was 6.25%, net of administrative and investment fees paid from plan assets. We believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon. A 100 basis point change in our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our 2023 U.S. net periodic benefit cost by approximately $8 million. Additionally, every 100 basis point variation in actual return on plan assets versus our expected return of 6.25% will impact our unrecognized pre-tax actuarial net loss by approximately $8 million. 47 An increase in actuarial loss due to changes in plan assets, primarily due to 2022 asset returns, has contributed to an unrecognized pre-tax actuarial net loss of $70 million included in Accumulated other comprehensive income for these U.S. plans at December 31, 2022. We will recognize approximately $1 million of gain in net periodic benefit cost in 2023 versus $11 million of loss recognized in 2022. Income Taxes At December 31, 2022, we had valuation allowances of $458 million to reduce our $1,558 million of deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. The net deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary differences in profitable U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions and net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions, the majority of which do not expire. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider future taxable income in the various jurisdictions, carryforward periods, restrictions on usage and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies and refranchising plans. Thus, recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes. As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our Income tax provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement. At December 31, 2022, we had $128 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $82 million of which would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. We evaluate unrecognized tax benefits, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements, which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures. Repatriation of earnings generated after December 31, 2017, will generally be eligible for the 100% dividends received deduction or considered a distribution of previously taxed income and, therefore, exempt from U.S. federal tax. Undistributed foreign earnings may still be subject to certain state and foreign income and withholding taxes upon repatriation. Subject to limited exceptions, we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest our unremitted earnings outside the U.S. Thus, we have provided taxes, including any U.S. federal and state income, foreign income, or foreign withholding taxes on the majority of our unremitted earnings. In jurisdictions where we do intend to indefinitely reinvest our unremitted earnings, we would be required to accrue and pay applicable income taxes (if any) and foreign withholding taxes if the funds were repatriated in taxable transactions. We believe any such taxes would be immaterial. Ransomware Attack On January 18, 2023, the Company announced a ransomware attack that impacted certain Information Technology ( IT ) systems. Promptly upon the detection of the incident, the Company initiated response protocols and an investigation, engaged the services of industry-leading cybersecurity and forensics professionals and notified Federal law enforcement. This incident resulted in the closure of fewer than 300 restaurants in one market for one day, and certain of the Company IT systems and data were affected. In addition, although data was taken from our network, there is no evidence that customer databases were accessed. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, certain expenses related to this attack, including expenses to respond to, remediate and investigate this matter. We remain subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the incident, including as a result of the data that was taken from the Company network as noted above. While the Company response to this incident is ongoing, at this time we do not believe such impact of the incident will ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
