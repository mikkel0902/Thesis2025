MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(Dollars in tables and graphs in millions)
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Honeywell International Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (Honeywell or the Company) for the three years ended December 31, 2020. All references to Notes relate to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the section titled Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
On October 1, 2018, we completed the tax-free spin-off to Honeywell shareowners of our Transportation Systems business, previously part of Aerospace, into a standalone publicly-traded company, Garrett Motion Inc. (Garrett).
On October 29, 2018, we completed the tax-free spin-off to Honeywell shareowners of our Homes and Global Distribution business, previously part of Home and Building Technologies (renamed Honeywell Building Technologies following the spin-off), into a standalone publicly-traded company, Resideo Technologies, Inc. (Resideo).
We removed the assets and liabilities associated with Garrett and Resideo from our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the effective dates of the respective spin-offs. We included the results of operations for Garrett and Resideo in our Consolidated Statement of Operations through the effective dates of the respective spin-offs. Total sales attributable to these spin-offs were $6.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018.
A detailed discussion of the prior year 2019 to 2018 year-over-year changes are not included herein and can be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 14, 2020.
COVID-19 UPDATE
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Asia. Over the next several months, COVID-19 quickly spread across the world. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, the virus continues to spread and many countries are experiencing a resurgence in infection rates. Although vaccines have recently been made available, the availability and distribution of the vaccines continue to provide challenges.
Governments took unprecedented actions to contain the spread of COVID-19, temporarily shutting down non-essential businesses, issuing stay at home or “shelter in place” orders and asking citizens to avoid all non-essential travel. In certain situations, governments closed borders and issued mandatory quarantines. Companies were asked, and in many cases were required, to allow non-essential employees to work remotely. Consumer spending declined, global travel demand declined significantly, and the world entered a global recession.
These events impacted our business operations in multiple ways. In the first quarter of 2020, we quickly responded to the changing environment. In January 2020, we implemented policies in select countries within Asia to restrict travel and require employees to work from home for all roles that allow for remote work. In March 2020, we expanded this work from home policy to include our employees worldwide. We introduced appropriate safety and hygiene protocols to enable our manufacturing employees to operate safely through the pandemic. We actively monitored the changing government rules and regulations for each of our locations worldwide.
We remain cautious as many factors remain unpredictable, including the increasing rate of COVID-19 infections. We continue to monitor COVID-19 infection rates globally and acknowledge the risk of new surges in COVID-19 infections.
We prepared procedures for the phased return of our employees to office sites and trained our local site leaders in the appropriate safety and hygiene protocols. As of December 31, 2020, all of our manufacturing sites continue to operate and, outside of India, most of our employees in Asia have returned to the workplace in some capacity. We also returned small numbers of workers to select office sites within Europe and North America. In many countries, including the U.S., most of our non-manufacturing employees continue to work from home (for all roles that allow for remote work).

The global recession resulted in a slow-down in demand for many of the products and services that we offer. The impact on each of our businesses is outlined below:
•Aerospace – The decline in global travel negatively impacted many of our customers, resulting in lower demand for our products from OEMs and negatively impacted demand for our commercial aftermarket businesses. As a result, this segment's sales and profits declined for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
•Performance Materials and Technologies – Many of our customers operate in the oil and gas industry. The decline in global travel, coupled with excessive oil and gas supply, negatively impacted many of our customers and resulted in lower demand for our products. As a result, this segment's sales and profits declined for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
•Honeywell Building Technologies – Our customers own or manage buildings in a variety of industries including commercial real estate, hospitality, government, healthcare, banking and education. The global recession impacted many of these industries, resulting in a reduction of discretionary spending. As a result, this segment's sales and profits declined for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
•Safety and Productivity Solutions – The global pandemic created significant demand for our respiratory PPE and warehouse automation driving increases in this segment's sales and profits for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
As a result of the slowdown in demand for our products, we implemented several cost reduction programs across our enterprise. We canceled our 2020 merit increases and reduced executive and Board of Director compensation. We initiated reduced work schedules across the company and implemented permanent census reductions.
We also took several steps to secure additional liquidity. In March 2020, we entered into a $6.0 billion Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement. In May 2020, we completed a public Senior Notes offering, which provided $3.0 billion of available liquidity and permanently reduced the undrawn commitments under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement by $3.0 billion. In June 2020, we drew on the remaining $3.0 billion of commitments under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement. In August 2020, we completed a public Senior Notes offering, which provided $3.0 billion of available liquidity and was used to repay the outstanding principal amount of $3.0 billion under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, there are no outstanding borrowings or commitments remaining under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement. Further, we held $15.2 billion of available cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments.
We continue to monitor and respond to the changing conditions created by the pandemic.
Employee Health, Safety, and Economic Wellness
We continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and its impacts globally. We are prioritizing the health and safety of our employees. Out of an abundance of caution for the health of our employees and to support local government initiatives to stem the spread of the virus, we implemented several precautions at various sites around the world at all times in compliance with local government requirements and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. These include, but are not limited to:
•Limiting visitor site access to business-essential purposes;
•Introducing screening checks at certain sites where permissible or mandated;
•Enabling employees to work from home wherever and whenever required or appropriate;
•Continuously updating travel guidance, according to latest developments; and
•Complying with all local health authority guidance or regulations and our own protocols, including requesting employees to comply with self-quarantine requirements whenever advisable.
We have taken a number of measures to support our employees during these difficult times. We extended medical benefits globally to cover out-of-pocket costs associated with testing for coronavirus, and for those on our U.S. company medical plans, we are also covering treatment costs. In Mexico, we introduced a medical benefit for employees at lower compensation levels to ensure access to private medical treatment. In the U.S., we changed our sick leave plan for non-exempt employees to make more sick time available earlier in the year if it is needed. We established a $10 million company-funded relief fund targeting employees worldwide at lower compensation levels, especially those on reduced work hours who did not receive high levels of income replacement from unemployment or other government assistance.


10 Honeywell International, Inc.

In addition to the measures to assist our employees, Honeywell contributed $2 million to establish a Small Business Innovation Fund in Charlotte to help our local economy. The fund helps storefront businesses with 50 or fewer employees make investments in new technologies and business models to adjust to the realities of operating in the COVID-19 environment. The fund prioritizes businesses owned by women, minorities and veterans.
Our Commitment to Public Health
In a partnership with the State of North Carolina and other local businesses, we announced a goal to deliver 1 million COVID-19 vaccines in North Carolina by July 4, 2021. In Phoenix, where our Aerospace business is headquartered, we will sponsor a week-long vaccination program in February 2021. In addition, Honeywell funded the provision of approximately 10 million meals and a month’s supply of hygiene kits to families in India suffering hardships due to the crisis.
As we produce critical worker safety gear such as face masks, gloves, goggles, safety suits, and protective footwear, we play an essential role in the health and well-being of people and economies. To date, Honeywell has donated more than 2 million masks to frontline workers across multiple regions. Our customers and communities are depending on us more than ever to deliver for them and we are committed to supporting the safety of our employees, customers and fellow citizens around the world.
We are investing in new production facilities and continue to expand existing facilities to increase production of essential PPE products. We will bring these products to market as quickly as possible. We are committed to healthcare professionals, first responders, distributors and other stakeholders in an effort to ensure our PPE products are being placed quickly and cost-effectively in the hands of those most in need.
We announced our new capacity in the U.S. to make N95 masks, with production lines added in Rhode Island and Arizona that will collectively produce 40 million masks each month to support health, safety, and response workers globally. In addition, we are expanding our non-U.S. capacity with a new mask manufacturing line in the UK that is expected to produce 4.5 million masks each month, and a new line in India that is expected to produce 2 million masks each month. Separately, we are collaborating with Mubadala Investment Company's subsidiary, Strata Manufacturing, in the UAE to produce 30 million masks annually.
We have communicated the following principles to our authorized distributor network:
•Our expectation that, at a minimum, all of our partners will comply with all applicable laws prohibiting price gouging and apply appropriate diligence to the greatest extent possible to understand how our products are being purchased so that they are placed quickly and cost-effectively in the hands of those most in need - including first responders and medical professionals.
•While we do not control the prices that third parties set, we expect our partners to fairly price PPE used in the COVID-19 response effort.
•If we find that one of our partners is not upholding the letter or spirit of these principles, we reserve the right not to fulfill that partner’s orders and terminate our relationship with that party.
We are also investing in developing and bringing to market a wide array of new COVID-related products, including but not limited to Healthy Buildings solutions, remote operations offerings, automation technologies to help speed vaccine development, vaccine packaging solutions, an ultraviolet cleaning system for aircraft, innovative dual-layer face covers and safety packs.
Plant Productivity and Safety
In situations where our businesses were deemed essential, we worked with local officials to determine how to safely operate our manufacturing facilities. We successfully operated these manufacturing facilities with minimal disruption in our productivity. In the second quarter of 2020, we repurposed certain manufacturing facilities to produce PPE that was in short supply around the world. As of December 31, 2020, more than 95% of our manufacturing sites were operating at normal production levels.
We continue to provide essential services and produce essential goods around the world. We employ standards such as screening checks, use of masks, face coverings and other safety equipment and social distancing practices along production lines in our production facilities at all times in compliance with local government requirements and CDC guidelines. We take appropriate actions including disinfecting and quarantine procedures when a suspected COVID-19 case is identified.

Customers and Suppliers
Current global economic conditions due to COVID-19 have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our customers’ and suppliers’ ability to operate or obtain financing, particularly in our airline, oil and gas, and automotive end markets. Customer or supplier bankruptcies, delays in their ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing could adversely affect our cash flow or results of operations. We continue to actively monitor both supplier and customer financial health and take measures to manage our supply chain disruptions and limit our exposure.

Tax Expense
hon-20201231_g10.jpg
2020 compared with 2019
The effective tax rate for 2020 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the previously completed spin-off transactions, tax impact of restructuring, tax law changes in India, and the resolution of certain U.S. tax matters offset by accrued withholding taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings and non-cash charges related to the reduction of the aggregate carrying value of certain receivables with no corresponding tax benefit.
The effective tax rate for 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily resulting from the impacts of revised guidance related to U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and internal restructuring initiatives that resulted in a $281 million reduction of accrued withholding taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings.
For further discussion of changes in the effective tax rate, see Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Net Income Attributable to Honeywell
hon-20201231_g11.jpg
