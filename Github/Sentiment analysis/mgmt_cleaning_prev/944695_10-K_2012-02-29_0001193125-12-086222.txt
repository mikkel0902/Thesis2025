Our results of operations include the accounts of The Hanover Insurance Company ( Hanover Insurance ) and Citizens Insurance Company of America ( Citizens ), our principal U.S. domiciled property and casualty companies; Chaucer Holdings plc ( Chaucer ), and certain other insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries. Effective July 1, 2011, we acquired Chaucer, a specialist insurance underwriting group which operates through the Society and Corporation of Lloyd ( Lloyds ) and is domiciled in the United Kingdom ( U.K. ). Our results of operations include Chaucer results for the period from July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. Additionally, our results of operations include our discontinued operations, consisting of our former life insurance and accident and health businesses. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Our business operations consist of four operating segments: Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, Chaucer and Other Property and Casualty. As further described in Note 2 Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations on pages 96 to 98 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K, we acquired Chaucer on July 1, 2011, which has added meaningful business volumes to the six months ended December 31, 2011 and has affected the comparability of our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our discussion of the results of operations reflects Chaucer results only for the period from July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011, while the Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, and Other Property and Casualty segments include results for all of 2011. Results of operations for the comparable periods in 2009 and 2010 do not include any results of Chaucer. Chaucer financial results for the six months ended December 31, 2011 will be discussed separately. Our segment income excluding taxes and interest of $72.5 million in 2011, includes $32.3 million of segment income generated by Chaucer. Our pre-tax segment earnings declined in 2011, principally due to an unprecedented level of weather related events that affected the property and casualty industry. Pre-tax catastrophe losses were $361.6 million during 2011, of which $49.5 million related to our Chaucer segment. During 2010, pre-tax catastrophe losses were $160.3 million. Our 2011 catastrophe losses were principally the result of winter storms, tornado, hail and windstorm activity in both the Midwest and the Northeast in the first half of the year, Hurricane Irene and floods in Thailand and Denmark during the second half of 2011. A decrease of $43.3 million in favorable development on prior years loss and loss adjustment expense ( LAE ) reserves, primarily from Commercial and Personal lines, also contributed to the overall decline in segment results from the prior year. Segment income for our Commercial, Personal, and Other Property and Casualty lines, excluding catastrophes and development, was $284.5 million in 2011, compared to $276.9 million in 2010, reflecting growth in earned premium and the resulting positive effect on our expense ratio, and what we believe is an improved mix of business, partially offset by increased non-catastrophe weather-related losses. Commercial Lines We believe our small commercial capabilities, distinctiveness in the middle market, and continued development of specialty lines provides us with a diversified portfolio of products and delivers significant value to agents and policyholders. The small commercial and middle market accounts are expected to significantly contribute to premium growth in Commercial Lines over the next several years. We expect to pursue our core strategy of developing deep partnerships with agents, distinctive products, franchise value through limited distribution, and industry segmentation. Growth in our specialty lines continues to be a significant part of our strategy. The expansion of product offerings in our specialized lines has been supported by several acquisitions over the past several years. Our Commercial Lines segment net written premium grew by 7.5% in 2011, with contributions from both our specialty lines and core segments. Our net earned premium increased by 19.5% in 2011, primarily as a result of fully earning in premiums written previously pursuant to the 2010 renewal rights transaction with OneBeacon Insurance Group ( OneBeacon ). We believe these efforts have and will continue to drive improvement in our overall mix of business and ultimately our underwriting profitability. Our losses and loss adjustment expenses were higher in 2011 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the high level of catastrophe losses and, to a lesser extent, non-catastrophe weather-related losses. Notwithstanding the increase in losses and LAE, there was a modest increase in current accident year income primarily due to the growth in earned premium and changes to our mix of business. -41- Table of Contents The competitive nature of the Commercial Lines market requires us to be highly disciplined in our underwriting process to ensure that we write business only at acceptable margins. In certain lines of business where a weak economy may be a particularly important factor, such as surety and workers compensation, we endeavor to adjust pricing or take a more conservative approach to risk selection in order to more appropriately reflect the higher risk of loss. Additionally, we are seeking additional rate increases in our property lines as a result of the heightened catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses that we experienced in 2011. Personal Lines In our Personal Lines business, we focus on partnering with high quality, value-added agencies that deliver consultative selling and stress the importance of account rounding (the conversion of single policy customers to accounts with multiple policies and additional coverages). Almost 70% of our policies in force in 2011 were account business. We are focused on making investments that help maintain profitability, build a distinctive position in the market, help diversify us geographically from our historical core states of Michigan, Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey and provide us with profitable growth opportunities. Written premiums in Personal Lines in 2011 were comparable to 2010. Underwriting results, excluding catastrophes, improved slightly in 2011, as compared to 2010. Lower operating expenses in 2011 were partially offset by less favorable current accident year results driven by non-catastrophe weather-related losses. Similar to our strategy in Commercial Lines, we are seeking additional rate increases in our property lines (homeowners coverage) as a result of the recent catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses that the industry experienced. In addition, continued increases in premium are expected in our target growth states as we seek to improve profitability and diversify from our existing core states. Chaucer We deploy specialist underwriters in over 30 major insurance and reinsurance classes throughout our diversified portfolio, which includes property, marine and aviation, energy, U.K. motor and casualty. We access business through Lloyd s, the leading international insurance and reinsurance market, which provides us with access to specialist business in over 200 countries and territories worldwide through its international licenses, brand reputation and strong security rating. We currently expect underwriting opportunities to increase, and terms and conditions to improve across the majority of international risk classes for our Chaucer business in 2012. This follows a difficult period for international insurance markets since 2010, with increased frequency and severity of both natural and man-made catastrophes worldwide. We expect to focus more of our capital and underwriting capabilities in those areas where we expect rates to be more favorable, in particular, for catastrophe-exposed property, marine and energy risks, and less toward business where rates are currently under pressure, notably casualty and aviation. We also expect to benefit from continued rate increases in the U.K. motor market, which comprised approximately 28% of Chaucer net written premium for the six months ended December 31, 2011. We are also seeking opportunities to diversify the business further, including the development of new lines of business, such as international liability, that we expect to meet our return on capital criteria. Overall, we believe that the strength and depth of our underwriting teams, the broad diversity of our underwriting portfolio and our membership in the Lloyd platform, together underpin our ability to manage both the scale and composition of our business. Moreover, these strengths, combined with our continued active management of our portfolio and the opportunities that we expect to arise across the majority of our markets, provide a strong basis for the profitable development of the Chaucer business. Description of Operating Segments Our primary business operations include insurance products and services currently provided through four operating segments. These operating segments are Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, Chaucer and Other Property and Casualty. Commercial Lines includes commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, workers compensation and other commercial coverages, such as specialty program business, inland marine, surety and other bonds, professional liability and management liability. Personal Lines includes personal automobile, homeowners and other personal coverages. Chaucer includes property, marine and aviation, energy, U.K. motor, and casualty and other coverages (which includes international liability, specialist coverages, and syndicate participations). The Other Property and Casualty segment consists of Opus Investment Management, Inc., which markets investment management services to institutions, pension funds and other organizations; earnings on holding company assets; and, a voluntary pools business which is in run-off. We present the separate financial information of each segment consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates results in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. -42- Table of Contents We report interest expense related to our debt separately from the earnings of our operating segments. Our debt consists of senior debentures, junior debentures, subordinated notes, advances under our collateralized borrowing program with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston ( FHLBB ), and capital securities. Results of Operations Net Income Our consolidated net income includes the results of our four operating segments (segment income), which we evaluate on a pre-tax basis and excluding interest expense on debt. Segment income excludes certain other items which we believe are not indicative of our core operations, such as income taxes and net realized investment gains and losses, including net gains and losses on certain derivative instruments. Such gains and losses are excluded since they are determined by interest rates, financial markets and the timing of sales. Also, segment income excludes net gains and losses on disposals of businesses, discontinued operations, costs to acquire businesses, restructuring costs, extraordinary items, the cumulative effect of accounting changes and certain other items. Although the items excluded from segment income may be significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance, we believe a discussion of segment income enhances an investor understanding of our results of operations by segregating income attributable to the core operations of the business. However, segment income should not be construed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development are significant components in understanding and assessing the financial performance of our business. Management reviews and evaluates catastrophes and prior year reserve development separate from the other components of earnings. Catastrophes and prior-year reserve development are not predictable as to timing or the amount that will affect the results of our operations and have affected our results in the past few years. Management believes that providing certain financial metrics and trends excluding the effects of catastrophes and prior year reserve development helps investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings and to evaluate the underlying performance of our operations. 2011 Compared to 2010 Our consolidated net income was $37.1 million in 2011, compared to $154.8 million in 2010. The $117.7 million decrease is primarily driven by an increase in catastrophe losses and non-catastrophe weather-related activity, partially offset by income from our Chaucer segment. Additionally, in the year ended December 31, 2011, advisory, legal, and accounting costs associated with the acquisition of Chaucer and other acquisition expenses totaled $16.4 million. We also recorded an $11.3 million loss in connection with a foreign exchange contract entered into in connection with the acquisition of Chaucer, which was partially offset by net foreign exchange gains of $6.7 million. 2010 Compared to 2009 Our consolidated net income was $154.8 million in 2010, compared to $197.2 million in 2009. The $42.4 million decrease is primarily driven by higher catastrophe losses, which increased $39.9 million, net of taxes. Results in 2009 included a $34.5 million pre-tax gain ($22.3 million, net of taxes) associated with a tender offer, whereby we repurchased at a discount a portion of our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities and our senior debentures. In 2010, we repurchased junior debentures which resulted in a $2.0 million loss. In addition, earnings from our discontinued operations decreased by $7.8 million. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $28.3 million increase in net realized investment gains, from a gain of $1.4 million in 2009, to a gain of $29.7 million in 2010. The following table reflects segment income as determined in accordance with GAAP and a reconciliation of total segment income to consolidated net income .

The segment results are presented before interest expense, taxes and other items which management believes are not indicative of our core operations, including realized gains and losses. The following table summarizes the results of operations for the periods indicated: FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Segment revenues Net premiums written $ 3,593.4 $ 3,048.0 $ 2,608.7 Net premiums earned 3,598.6 2,841.0 2,546.4 Net investment income 258.2 247.2 251.7 Other income 51.9 38.9 38.6 Total segment revenues 3,908.7 3,127.1 2,836.7 Losses and operating expenses Losses and LAE 2,550.8 1,856.3 1,639.2 Policy acquisition expenses 854.0 669.0 581.3 Other operating expenses 431.4 374.1 346.1 Total losses and operating expenses 3,836.2 2,899.4 2,566.6 Segment income before interest expense and income taxes $ 72.5 $ 227.7 $ 270.1 2011 Compared to 2010 Segment income was $72.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $227.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $155.2 million. Chaucer results accounted for $32.3 million of segment income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Catastrophe related activity for our Commercial and Personal Lines businesses was $312.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $160.3 million for the same period in 2010, an increase of $151.8 million. Excluding the impact of catastrophe related activity, earnings for our Commercial and Personal Lines businesses would have decreased by $35.7 million. This decrease was primarily due to higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses and LAE and lower favorable development on prior years loss and LAE reserves, partially offset by growth in earned premium and the resulting positive effect on our expense ratio and what we believe is an underlying improvement in our mix of business. Favorable development on prior years loss and LAE reserves for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $67.8 million compared to $111.1 million in the prior year, a decrease of $43.3 million. Net premiums written grew by $545.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, and net premiums earned grew by $757.6 million. Chaucer accounted for $428.8 million of net premiums written and $506.3 million of net premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2011. The balance of the growth in net premiums written is attributable to Commercial Lines. A significant portion of the increase in net premiums earned in Commercial Lines is a result of the growth in net premiums written in 2010 following the OneBeacon renewal rights transaction, as well as growth in our AIX program business and in various niche and segmented businesses. 2010 Compared to 2009 Segment income was $227.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $270.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $42.4 million. Catastrophe related activity for our Commercial and Personal Lines businesses was $160.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $98.9 million for the same period in 2009, an increase of $61.4 million. This increase was primarily related to several severe hail, wind and thunderstorm events, particularly in the first half of 2010. Excluding the impact of catastrophe related activity, segment income would have increased by $19.0 million. This increase was primarily due to more favorable current accident year loss results with improvements in both Commercial and Personal Lines, partially offset by lower favorable development on prior years loss and LAE reserves, higher expenses and slightly lower net investment income. Favorable development on prior years loss and LAE reserves for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $111.1 million compared to $155.3 million in the prior year, a decrease of $44.2 million. PRODUCTION AND UNDERWRITING RESULTS The following table summarizes net premiums written and loss, LAE, expense and combined ratios for the Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Chaucer segments. Results for Chaucer reflect the period from July 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011. Loss and LAE, catastrophe loss and combined ratios include prior year reserve development. These items are not meaningful for our Other Property and Casualty segment. -44- Table of Contents FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 (dollars in millions) Gross Written Premium Net Written Premium Net Earned Premium Catastrophe Loss Ratios Loss & LAE Ratios Expense Ratios Combined Ratios Commercial Lines $ 1,938.0 $ 1,703.1 $ 1,641.7 9.0 68.2 38.9 107.1 Personal Lines 1,561.3 1,461.2 1,450.5 11.3 77.1 27.1 104.2 Chaucer 559.6 428.8 506.3 9.8 61.9 35.9 97.8 Total $ 4,058.9 $ 3,593.1 $ 3,598.5 10.0 70.8 33.8 104.6 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 (dollars in millions) Gross Written Premium Net Written Premium Net Earned Premium Catastrophe Loss Ratios Loss & LAE Ratios Expense Ratios Combined Ratios Commercial Lines $ 1,798.5 $ 1,584.8 $ 1,373.4 4.5 59.1 42.2 101.3 Personal Lines 1,559.8 1,462.9 1,467.3 6.7 71.3 27.8 99.1 Total $ 3,358.3 $ 3,047.7 $ 2,840.7 5.6 65.3 34.8 100.1 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 (dollars in millions) Gross Written Premium Net Written Premium Net Earned Premium Catastrophe Loss Ratios Loss & LAE Ratios Expense Ratios Combined Ratios Commercial Lines $ 1,352.9 $ 1,136.3 $ 1,084.8 2.6 52.8 41.3 94.1 Personal Lines 1,562.5 1,472.2 1,461.3 4.8 73.8 28.3 102.1 Total $ 2,915.4 $ 2,608.5 $ 2,546.1 3.9 64.3 33.8 98.2 The following table summarizes net premiums written, and loss and LAE and catastrophe loss ratios by line of business for the Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments.

This $118.3 million increase was primarily driven by growth in our specialty businesses, particularly in our AIX program business, which accounted for $57.1 million of this growth. Also benefiting the overall growth comparison in net premiums written were modest rate increases. Commercial Lines underwriting loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $121.3 million, compared to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase in losses of $100.7 million. This was due to higher weather-related losses and LAE, including catastrophes, and decreased favorable development on prior years loss and LAE reserves, partially offset by growth in earned premium and the resulting positive effect on our expense ratio. Catastrophe losses for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $148.4 million, primarily due to Hurricane Irene during the third quarter, significant tornado, hail and windstorm activity in the second quarter and winter storms in the first quarter, compared to $61.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $86.8 million. Favorable development on prior years loss and LAE reserves for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $34.7 million, compared to $61.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $26.8 million. Included in 2010 results was $7.5 million of favorable LAE development, principally related to a change in the cost factors used for establishing unallocated LAE reserves. Commercial Lines underwriting loss, excluding catastrophe and prior year loss and LAE reserve development, for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $7.6 million, compared to $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This $12.9 million improvement resulted from growth in earned premium and the resulting positive effect on our expense ratio, and from what we believe to be an improved mix of business. Partially offsetting the effect of this growth were higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses and LAE, and higher losses in our surety business. The higher level of earned premiums primarily resulted from our 2010 OneBeacon transaction, from growth in our AIX program business, and from other growth initiatives. Our ability to increase Commercial Lines net premiums written while maintaining or improving underwriting results may be affected by competition and the current challenging economic environment. Personal Lines Personal Lines net premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $1,461.2 million, compared to $1,462.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $1.7 million. The most significant factors contributing to this small decrease were actions we have taken to reduce our market concentration in Louisiana, and our continued focus on driving profit improvement in our core states through both rate increases and more selective portfolio management, resulting in lower new business activity. These decreases were partially offset by higher rates in both our personal automobile and homeowners lines, and by a net premiums written increase of 7.1% in our target growth states. Continued increases in premium are expected in our target growth states as we seek to improve profitability in those states and diversify from our core states. Net premiums written in the personal automobile line of business declined 2.6%, primarily as a result of fewer policies in force in Michigan, Massachusetts, New York and Florida. We attribute the decrease in policies in force to more selective portfolio management, and to rate increases we have implemented despite the competitive pricing environment. Net premiums written in the homeowners line of business increased 4.5%, resulting primarily from rate increases. Personal Lines underwriting loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $73.0 million, compared to a profit of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $74.6 million. This decrease is due to higher weather-related losses and LAE, including catastrophes, and to decreased favorable development on prior years loss and LAE reserves, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Catastrophe losses were $163.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, including significant winter storms, tornado, hail and windstorm activity in the first half of the year and Hurricane Irene during the third quarter, compared to $98.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $65.0 million. Favorable development on prior years loss and LAE reserves was $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $48.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $15.8 million. Included in 2010 results was $2.3 million of favorable LAE development, principally related to a change in the cost factors used for establishing unallocated LAE reserves. Personal Lines underwriting profit, excluding prior year loss and LAE reserve development and catastrophes, was $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $51.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $6.2 million. This increase in non-catastrophe current accident year results was primarily due to lower operating expenses and what we believe is an improved mix of business, partially offset by non-catastrophe weather-related losses. Although we have been able to obtain rate increases in our Personal Lines markets, our ability to maintain and increase Personal Lines net written premium and to maintain and improve underwriting results could be affected by price competition, regulatory and legal developments and the current challenging economic conditions, particularly -47- Table of Contents in Michigan, which is our largest state. Our rate actions have adversely affected our ability to increase our policies in force and new business, particularly in our core states and in Florida. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current level of production or maintain or increase rates in light of the highly competitive environment. We may also implement various rate, underwriting, and other actions to create capacity for growing partner agent account business, reduce our property concentrations, and with a view to increasing our longer-term profitability. Such events may affect our ability to grow. Chaucer Chaucer net premiums written was $428.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2011. By line of business, Chaucer net premiums written were comprised of 28.4% U.K. motor, 25.0% marine and aviation, 17.0% property, 15.6% energy and 14.0% casualty and other lines. This business mix reflects our specialist underwriting strategy and active management of our portfolio. Chaucer underwriting profit for the six months ended December 31, 2011 was $11.3 million. Catastrophe losses for the six months ended December 31, 2011 were $49.5 million, principally due to floods in Thailand and Denmark. Favorable development on prior years loss and LAE reserves for the six months ended December 31, 2011 was $35.5 million. Chaucer underwriting profit, excluding prior year loss and LAE development and catastrophes, was $25.3 million in the six months ended December 31, 2011. Underwriting expenses of $181.8 million represented 35.9% of earned premium. We currently expect to achieve rate increases for a majority of Chaucer lines in 2012. Recent natural catastrophe losses, particularly those affecting the U.S., New Zealand, Japan and Thailand, are triggering rate increases in the majority of catastrophe-exposed territories. We also expect to see terms and conditions improve in our energy portfolio as markets respond to losses in 2011. We expect our casualty and aviation accounts to remain challenging, with over-capacity affecting pricing. In our U.K. motor account, which has experienced significant price increases since 2010, we expect more modest rate increases in 2012, although we anticipate these will exceed claims inflation. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or increase our rates in light of economic and regulatory conditions in our markets. Other Property and Casualty Other Property and Casualty segment loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $0.5 million, compared to a profit of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The $4.0 million decrease is primarily due to lower net investment income and less favorable development in our run-off voluntary pools. 2010 Compared to 2009 Commercial Lines Commercial Lines net premiums written was $1,584.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $1,136.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This $448.5 million increase was primarily driven by increased premiums associated with the OneBeacon renewal rights transaction of $289.1 million, and growth in our managed program business through AIX, which accounted for $63.9 million, as well as growth in various niche and segmented businesses. Also benefiting the overall growth comparison in net premiums written was a slight improvement in rate. Commercial Lines underwriting loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $20.6 million, compared to a profit of $60.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $81.5 million. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in favorable prior year loss and LAE reserve development, increased catastrophe losses resulting from several severe hail, wind and thunderstorm events, and to higher expenses, partially offset by more favorable current accident year loss results. Catastrophe losses for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $61.6 million, compared to $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $33.0 million. This increase was primarily in our commercial multiple peril line. Favorable development on prior years loss and LAE reserves for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $61.5 million, compared to $104.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $42.6 million. This change was primarily related to our surety bonds, workers compensation, and commercial multiple peril lines. Included in the current year results was $7.5 million of favorable LAE development, principally related to a change in the cost factors used for establishing unallocated LAE reserves. LAE in 2009 includes a benefit of $18.0 million, including $14.4 million associated with prior accident years, related to a change in our unallocated loss adjustment expense reserving methodology. Commercial Lines underwriting loss, excluding prior year loss and LAE reserve development and catastrophes, for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $20.5 million, compared to $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This $5.9 million increase in losses was primarily due to increased operating expenses, principally attributable to costs associated with our westward expansion initiative, increased variable compensation, and increased costs in our specialty business. These factors were partially offset by more favorable current accident year loss results, primarily in our surety bond and commercial multiple peril businesses. -48- Table of Contents Personal Lines Personal Lines net premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $1,462.9 million, compared to $1,472.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $9.3 million. The most significant factor contributing to lower net premiums written is our continued focus on driving profit improvement in our core states, resulting in lower new business activity. Policies in force in our core states decreased 7% in 2010. This was largely offset by our efforts to diversify our Personal Lines business into targeted growth states. Policies in force in our target growth states increased 4% in 2010. Net premiums written in the personal automobile line of business declined 3.4%, primarily as a result of lower policies in force in Michigan, Massachusetts, Florida and New York, which we attribute to our efforts to improve or maintain margins in those states and the competitive pricing environment. Net premiums written in the homeowners line of business increased 4.6%, resulting primarily from rate actions in 2010. Policies in force in the homeowners line increased in our targeted growth states, primarily from our account rounding initiatives. Personal Lines underwriting profit for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $1.6 million, compared to a loss of $43.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $45.2 million. This increase was primarily due to more favorable current accident year loss results, principally resulting from benign loss trends, which we attribute to improved non-catastrophe weather, and improvement in our mix of business, shifting to a greater proportion of whole account business, continued rate increases in both personal automobile and homeowners lines, and to lower expenses. These were partially offset by increased catastrophe losses due to several severe hail, wind, and thunderstorm events. Catastrophe losses were $98.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $70.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $28.4 million. Favorable development on prior years loss and LAE reserves was $48.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $9.4 million. Included in the current year results was $2.3 million of favorable LAE development, principally related to a change in the cost factors used for establishing unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves. LAE in 2009 included a benefit of $2.0 million, including $1.6 million associated with prior accident years, related to a change in our unallocated loss adjustment expense reserving methodology. Personal Lines underwriting profit, excluding prior year loss and LAE reserve development and catastrophes, was $51.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to a loss of $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $64.2 million. This increase was primarily due to more favorable current accident year loss results, principally resulting from lower frequency of losses, which we attribute to improved non-catastrophe weather and benign loss trends. Additionally, we experienced an improvement in our mix of business, shifting to a greater proportion of whole account business, as well as continued rate increases in both the personal automobile and homeowners lines. Also, underwriting and other operating expenses decreased, primarily due to lower pension costs, the favorable resolution of a loss contingency and to lower technology costs. Other Property and Casualty Other Property and Casualty segment income for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $3.5 million, compared to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $0.5 million decrease is primarily due to lower favorable development in our run-off voluntary pools, partially offset by lower pension costs in 2010. RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES Overview of Loss Reserve Estimation Process We maintain reserves for our property and casualty products to provide for our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses (our loss reserves ) with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period. These reserves are estimates, taking into account past loss experience, modified for current trends, as well as prevailing economic, legal and social conditions. Loss reserves represent our largest liability. Our loss reserves include case estimates for claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported ( IBNR ) at the balance sheet date. They also include estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims, less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries. Our property and casualty loss reserves are not discounted to present value. Case reserves are established by our claim personnel individually on a claim by claim basis and based on information specific to the occurrence and terms of the underlying policy. For some classes of business, average case reserves are used initially. Case reserves are periodically reviewed and modified based on new or additional information pertaining to the claim. IBNR reserves are estimated by management and our reserving actuaries on an aggregate basis for each line of business or coverage for loss and loss expense liabilities not reflected within the case reserves. The sum of the case reserves and the IBNR reserves represents our estimate of total unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. -49- Table of Contents We regularly review our loss reserves using a variety of industry accepted analytical techniques. We update the loss reserves as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and resolved and new information becomes available. Net changes in loss reserves are reflected in operating results in the period in which the reserves are changed. IBNR reserves are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate cost of all claims that have occurred or are expected to occur in the future and then subtracting reported losses and loss expenses. Reported losses include cumulative paid losses and loss expenses plus case reserves. The IBNR reserve includes a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us, some of which may not yet be known to the insured, as well as a provision for future development on reported claims. IBNR represents a significant proportion of our total net loss reserves, particularly for long-tail liability classes. In fact, approximately 42% of our aggregate net loss reserves at December 31, 2011 were for IBNR losses and loss expenses. Management process for establishing loss reserves is a comprehensive process that involves input from multiple functions throughout our organization, including finance, actuarial, claims, legal, underwriting, distribution and business operations management. The process incorporates facts currently known and the present, and in some cases, the anticipated, state of the law and coverage litigation. Based on information currently available, we believe that the aggregate loss reserves at December 31, 2011 were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred as of that date, including both those known to us and those yet to be reported. However, as described below, there are significant uncertainties inherent in the loss reserving process. Our estimate of the ultimate liability for losses that had occurred as of December 31, 2011 is expected to change in future periods as we obtain further information, and such changes could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Critical Judgments and Key Assumptions We determine the amount of our loss reserves based on an estimation process that is very complex and uses information from both company specific and industry data, as well as general economic and other information. The estimation process is a combination of objective and subjective information, the blending of which requires significant professional judgment. There are various assumptions required, including future trends in frequency and severity of claims, operational changes in claim handling, and trends related to general economic and social conditions. Informed subjective estimates and judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserve estimation process. Given the inherent complexity of our loss reserve estimation process and the potential variability of the assumptions used, the actual emergence of losses will vary, perhaps substantially, from the estimate of losses included in our financial statements, particularly in those instances where settlements or other claim resolutions do not occur until well into the future. Our net loss reserves at December 31, 2011 were $3.8 billion. Therefore, a relatively small percentage change in the estimate of net loss reserves would have a material effect on our results of operations. There is greater inherent uncertainty in estimating insurance reserves for certain types of property and casualty insurance lines, particularly liability lines, where a longer period of time may elapse before a definitive determination of ultimate liability and losses may be made. In addition, the technological, judicial, regulatory and political climates involving these types of claims are continuously evolving. There is also greater uncertainty in establishing reserves with respect to business that is new to us, particularly new business which is generated with respect to newly introduced product lines, by newly appointed agents or in geographies in which we have less experience in conducting business, such as the program business written by our AIX subsidiary, Chaucer international liability lines, our new professional liability specialty lines, and business written in the western part of the United States. In some of these cases, there is less historical experience or knowledge and less data upon which we can rely. A combination of business that is both new to us and has longer development periods, provides even greater uncertainty in estimating insurance reserves. Historically, we have limited the issuance of long-tailed other liability policies, including directors and officers ( D&O ) liability, errors and omissions ( E&O ) liability and medical professional liability. With the acquisition of Hanover Professionals in 2007, which writes lawyers professional E&O coverage, the acquisition of Campania in 2010, which writes medical professional liability and product liability coverages, and the introduction of new specialty coverages, such as our other professional management liability products, we are increasing, and expect to continue to increase, our exposure to longer tailed liability lines, including D&O coverages. The Chaucer business acquired this year contains several international and U.S. liability lines, of which financial institution and professional liability, international liability and energy liability, contribute the most uncertainty. -50- Table of Contents We regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and additional events occur which may impact the resolution of unsettled claims. Reserve adjustments are reflected in the results of operations as adjustments to losses and LAE. Often, these adjustments are recognized in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying policy was written and the loss event occurred. When these types of subsequent adjustments affect prior years, they are described separately as prior year reserve development . Such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results and may vary by line of business. As discussed below, estimated loss and LAE reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by $103.3 million, $111.1 million, and $155.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. However, we have experienced unfavorable development in prior years and there can be no absolute assurance that current loss and LAE reserves will be sufficient. We regularly review our reserving techniques, our overall reserving position and our reinsurance. Based on (i) our review of historical data, legislative enactments, judicial decisions, legal developments in impositions of damages and policy coverage, political attitudes and trends in general economic conditions, (ii) our review of per claim information, (iii) our historical loss experience and that of the industry, (iv) the nature of policies written by us, and (v) our internal estimates of required reserves, we believe that adequate provision has been made for loss reserves. However, establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that current established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience. A significant change to the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. An increase or decrease in reserve estimates would result in a corresponding decrease or increase in financial results. For example, each one percentage point change in the aggregate loss and LAE ratio resulting from a change in reserve estimation is currently projected to have an approximate $36 million impact on segment income, based on 2011 full year premiums. The major causes of material uncertainty relating to ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses ( risk factors ) generally vary for each line of business, as well as for each separately analyzed component of the line of business. In some cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method and in others, they are implicit. For example, a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged. Actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions, resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently. Some risk factors affect multiple lines of business. Examples include changes in claim department practices, changes in settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions, court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants, and degree of claimant fraud. Additionally, there is also a higher degree of uncertainty due to growth in our newly acquired businesses, with respect to which we have less familiarity and, in some cases, limited historical claims experience. The extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a line of business. Individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within line of business components. Thus, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves. Inflation generally increases the cost of losses covered by insurance contracts. The effect of inflation varies by product. Our property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and LAE and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses are known. Consequently, we attempt, in establishing rates and reserves, to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in the projection of ultimate costs. For example, we have experienced increasing medical and attendant care costs, including those associated with automobile personal injury protection claims, particularly in Michigan, as well as in our workers compensation line in most states. Also, the U.K. motor business written by Chaucer recently has experienced high levels of claims inflation and increases in potential fraud-type claims. These increases are reflected in our current reserve estimates, but continued increases could contribute to increased losses and LAE in the future. We are also defendants in various litigation matters, including putative class actions, which may claim punitive damages, bad faith or extra-contractual damages, legal fees and interest, or claim a broader scope of policy coverage than our interpretation. Resolution of these cases are often highly unpredictable and could involve material unanticipated damage awards. Loss and LAE Reserves by Line of Business Reserving Process Overview Our loss reserves include amounts related to short-tail and long-tail classes of business. Tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the final settlement of the claim. The longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim, the more the ultimate settlement amount is likely to vary from our original estimate. Short-tail classes consist principally of automobile physical damage, homeowners property, commercial property and marine business. The Chaucer business, while having -51- Table of Contents a longer tail on average than the our traditional U.S. business, contains a substantial book of U.K. motor property damage, worldwide property insurance and reinsurance business, including certain high excess property layers, marine property, aviation property and energy property business which has relatively short development patterns. For these property coverages, claims are generally reported and settled shortly after the loss occurs because the claims relate to tangible property and are more likely to be discovered shortly after the loss occurs and property losses are often more easily valued. Consequently, the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is generally less complex. However, this is less true for our Chaucer reinsurance business and high excess property layers where there is often a longer period of time between the date a claim is incurred and the date the claim is reported compared with our direct insurance operations. Therefore, the risk of delayed recognition of loss reserve development is higher for our assumed reinsurance and high excess property layers than for our direct insurance lines. While we estimate that a majority of our written premium is in what we would characterize as shorter tailed classes of business, most of our loss reserves relate to longer tail liability classes of business. Long-tailed classes include commercial liability, automobile liability, workers compensation and other types of third party coverage. Chaucer business longer tailed lines include aviation liability, marine liability, energy liability, nuclear liability, U.K. motor medical and liability, international liability, specialist liability, and financial institutions and professional liability. For many liability claims, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may elapse between the occurrence of the loss, the discovery and reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the claim. As a result, loss experience in the more recent accident years for long-tailed liability coverage has limited statistical credibility because a relatively small proportion of losses in these accident years are reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses. An accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is incurred. Liability claims are also more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations, the legal environment and the risk and expense of protracted litigation. Consequently, the estimation of loss reserves for these coverages is more complex and typically subject to a higher degree of variability compared to short-tail coverages. Most of our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools is long-tailed casualty reinsurance. Reserve estimates for this business are therefore subject to the variability caused by extended loss emergence periods. The estimation of loss reserves for this business is further complicated by delays between the time the claim is reported to the ceding insurer and when it is reported by the ceding insurer to the pool manager and then to us, and by our dependence on the quality and consistency of the loss reporting by the ceding company and actuarial estimates by the pool manager. A comprehensive review of loss reserves for each of the classes of business which we write is conducted regularly, generally quarterly. This review process takes into consideration a variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims. Where appropriate, the review includes a review of overall payment patterns and the emergence of paid and reported losses relative to expectations. The loss reserve estimation process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes. As part of this process, we use a variety of analytical methods that consider experience, trends and other relevant factors. Within the comprehensive loss reserving process, standard actuarial methods which include: (1) loss development factor methods; (2) expected loss methods (Bornheutter-Ferguson); and (3) adjusted loss methods (Berquist-Sherman), are given due consideration. These methods are described below: Loss development factor methods generally assume that the losses yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss amount observed to date. Historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses by accident year can be predictive of the expected future patterns that are applied to current paid and reported losses to generate estimated ultimate losses by accident year. Bornheutter-Ferguson methods utilize the product of the expected ultimate losses times the proportion of ultimate losses estimated to be unreported or unpaid (to calculate IBNR directly). The expected ultimate losses are based upon current estimates of ultimate losses from prior accident years, adjusted to reflect expected earned premium, current rating, claims cost levels and changes in business mix. The expected losses, and corresponding loss ratios, are a critical component of Bornheutter-Ferguson methodologies and provide a general reasonability guide. Berquist-Sherman methods are used for estimating reserves in business lines where historical development patterns may be deemed less reliable for more recent accident years ultimate losses. Under these methods, patterns of historical paid or reported losses are first adjusted to reflect current payment settlement patterns and case reserve adequacy and then evaluated in the same manner as the loss development factor methods described above. The reported loss development factor method can be less appropriate when the adequacy of case reserves suddenly changes, while the paid loss development factor method can likewise be less appropriate when settlement patterns suddenly change. -52- Table of Contents In addition to the methods described above, various tailored reserving methodologies are used for certain businesses. For example, for some low volume and high volatility classes of business, special reserving techniques are utilized that estimate IBNR by selecting the loss ratio that balances actual reported losses to expected reported losses as defined by the estimated underlying reporting pattern. Also, for some classes with long exposure periods (e.g. energy construction, engineering and political risks), earnings patterns plus an estimated reporting lag applied to the Bornheutter-Ferguson initial expected loss ratio are used to estimate IBNR. This is done in order to reflect the changing average exposure periods by policy year (and consequently accident year). In completing the loss reserve analysis, a variety of assumptions must be made for each line of business, coverage and accident year. Each estimation method has its own pattern, parameter and/or judgmental dependencies, with no estimation method being better than the others in all situations. The relative strengths and weaknesses of the various estimation methods, when applied to a particular class of business, can also change over time, depending on the underlying circumstances. In many cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the relevant class of business. The manner of application and the degree of reliance on a given method will vary by line of business and coverage, and by accident year based on an evaluation of the above dependencies and the potential volatility of the loss frequency and severity patterns. The estimation methods selected or given weight at a particular valuation date are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication for the loss reserves being evaluated. Selections incorporate input from claims personnel, pricing actuaries, and underwriting management on loss cost trends and other factors that could affect ultimate losses. For most classes of shorter tailed business in our Commercial and Personal Lines segments, the emergence of paid and incurred losses generally exhibits a relatively stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next. Thus, for these classes, the loss development factor method is generally appropriate. For many of the classes of shorter tailed business in our Chaucer segment, the emergence of paid and incurred losses may exhibit a relatively volatile pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next. In certain cases where there is a relatively low level of reliability placed on the available paid and incurred loss data, expected loss methods or adjusted loss methods are considered appropriate for the most recent accident year. For longer tailed lines of business, applying the loss development factor method often requires even more judgment in selecting development factors, as well as more significant extrapolation. For those long-tailed lines of business with high frequency and relatively low per-loss severity (e.g., personal automobile liability), volatility will often be sufficiently modest for the loss development factor method to be given significant weight, even in the most recent accident years, but expected loss methods and adjusted loss methods are always considered and frequently utilized in the selection process. For those long-tailed lines of business with low frequency and high loss potential (e.g., commercial liability), anticipated loss experience is less predictable because of the small number of claims and erratic claim severity patterns. In these situations, the loss development factor methods may not produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses in the most recent accident years since many claims either have not yet been reported or are only in the early stages of the settlement process. Therefore, the loss reserve estimates for these accident years are based on methods less reliant on extrapolation, such as Bornheutter-Ferguson. Over time, as a greater number of claims are reported and the statistical credibility of loss experience increases, loss development factor methods or adjusted loss methods are given increasing weight. Management endeavors to apply as much available data as practicable to estimate the loss reserve amount for each line of business, coverage and accident year, utilizing varying assumptions, projections and methods. The ultimate outcome is likely to fall within a range of potential outcomes around this loss reserve estimated amount. Our carried reserves for each line of business and coverage are determined based on this quarterly loss reserving process. In making the determination, we consider numerous quantitative and qualitative factors. Quantitative factors include changes in reserve estimates in the period, the maturity of the accident year, trends observed over the recent past, the level of volatility within a particular class of business, the estimated effects of reinsurance, including reinstatement premiums, general economic trends, and other factors. Qualitative factors may include legal and regulatory developments, changes in claim handling, recent entry into new markets or products, changes in underwriting practices, concerns that we do not have sufficient or quality historical reported and paid loss and LAE information with respect to a particular line or segment of our business, effects of the economy and political outlook, perceived anomalies in the historical results, evolving trends or other factors. In doing so, we must evaluate whether a change in the data represents credible actionable information or an anomaly. Such an assessment requires considerable judgment. Even if a change is determined to be apparent, it is not always possible to determine the extent of the change. As a result, there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be partially or fully reflected in the carried loss reserves. In general, changes are made more quickly to reserves for more mature accident years and less volatile classes of business. -53- Table of Contents Reserving Process Uncertainties As stated above, numerous factors (both internal and external) contribute to the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing loss reserves, including changes in the rate of inflation for goods and services related to insured damages (e.g., medical care, home repairs, etc.), changes in the judicial interpretation of policy provisions, changes in the general attitude of juries in determining damage awards, legislative actions, changes in the extent of insured injuries, changes in the trend of expected frequency and/or severity of claims, changes in our book of business (e.g., change in mix due to new product offerings, new geographic areas, etc.), changes in our underwriting practices, and changes in claim handling procedures and/or systems. Regarding our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools, we are provided loss estimates by managers of each pool. We adopt reserve estimates for the pools that consider this information and other facts. In addition, we must consider the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as legal, judicial, social conditions, political risks, and economic conditions change. For example, claims which we consider closed may be re-opened as additional damages surface or new liability theories are presented. These and other issues could have a negative effect on our loss reserves by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. As a result, the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience further complicate the already complex loss reserving process. As part of our loss reserving analysis, we consider the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process. Those factors that could materially affect our loss reserve estimates include loss development patterns and loss cost trends, reporting lags, rate and exposure level changes, the effects of changes in coverage and policy limits, business mix shifts, the effects of regulatory and legislative developments, the effects of changes in judicial interpretations, the effects of emerging claims and coverage issues and the effects of changes in claim handling practices. In making estimates of reserves, however, we do not necessarily make an explicit assumption for each of these factors. Moreover, all estimation methods do not utilize the same assumptions and typically no single method is determinative in the reserve analysis for a line of business and coverage. Consequently, changes in our loss reserve estimates generally are not the result of changes in any one assumption. Instead, the variability will be affected by the interplay of changes in numerous assumptions, many of which are implicit to the approaches used. For each line of business and coverage, we regularly adjust the assumptions and methods used in the estimation of loss reserves in response to our actual loss experience, as well as our judgments regarding changes in trends and/or emerging patterns. In those instances where we primarily utilize analyses of historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses, this may be reflected, for example, in the selection of revised loss development factors. In longer tailed classes of business and for which loss experience is less predictable due to potential changes in judicial interpretations, potential legislative actions, the cost of litigation or determining liability and the ultimate loss, inflation and potential claims issues, this may be reflected in a judgmental change in our estimate of ultimate losses for particular accident years. The Chaucer segment contains run-off business comprised of liability lines, notably financial institutions and professional liability business written by Lloyd Syndicate 4000. There is particular uncertainty around the reserve estimates in respect of business written in 2007 and 2008 which have been subject to claims arising out of the financial turmoil in that time period, particularly in the financial institutions book. These claims are unlikely to be settled for some time since they contain numerous coverage issues and in many cases involve class action lawsuits that are likely to take several years to resolve. We have utilized substantially all of our available reinsurance with respect to losses and LAE related to Syndicate 4000 business written in 2008. The future impact of the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process is impossible to predict. There is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves, particularly for long-tailed classes of business and classes of business that are more vulnerable to economic or political risks. We do not derive statistical loss distributions or confidence levels around our loss reserve estimate, and as a result, we do not establish reserve range estimates. -54- Table of Contents Reserving Process for Catastrophe Events The estimation of claims and claims expense reserves for catastrophes also comprises estimates of losses from reported claims and IBNR, primarily for damage to property. In general, our estimates for catastrophe reserves are determined on an event basis by considering various sources of available information, including specific loss estimates reported to us based on claim adjuster inspections, overall industry loss estimates, and our internal data regarding exposures related to the geographical location of the event. However, depending on the nature of the catastrophe, the estimation process can be further complicated by other impediments. For example, for hurricanes, complications often include the inability of insureds to promptly report losses, delays in the ability of claims adjusting staff to inspect losses, difficulties in determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy (generally for damage caused by wind or wind driven rain) or are specifically excluded from coverage caused by flood, and challenges in estimating additional living expenses, assessing the impact of demand surge, exposure to mold damage, and the effects of numerous other considerations. Estimates for catastrophes which occur at or near the end of a financial reporting period may be even less reliable since we will have less claims data available and little time to complete our estimation process. In such situations, we may adapt our practices to accommodate the circumstances. For events designated as catastrophes which affect our Commercial and Personal Lines business segments, we generally calculate IBNR reserves directly as a result of an estimated IBNR claim count and an estimated average claim amount for each event. Such an assessment involves a comprehensive analysis of the nature of the event, of policyholder exposures within the affected geographic area and of available claims intelligence. Depending on the nature of the event, available claims intelligence could include surveys of field claims associates within the affected geographic area, feedback from a catastrophe claims team sent into the area, as well as data on claims reported as of the financial statement date. In addition, loss emergence from similar historical events is compared to the estimated IBNR for our current catastrophe events to help assess the reasonableness of our estimates. For events designated as catastrophes which affect our Chaucer business segment, we initially calculate IBNR reserves using a ground up exposure by exposure analysis based on each cedant or insured. These are supported by broker supplied information, catastrophe modeling and industry event estimates. As more specific claim level data becomes available over time for each catastrophe event, these initial estimates are revised and updated by claim frequency and severity modeling as described above, as appropriate for each event. Reserving Sensitivity Analysis The following discussion presents disclosure related to possible variation in reserve estimates due to changes in key assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Many other assumptions may also lead to material reserve adjustments. If any such variations do occur, they would likely occur over a period of several years and therefore their impact on our results of operations would be spread over the same period. It is important to note, however, that there is the potential for future variations greater than the amounts described below and for any such variations to be recognized in a single quarterly or annual period. No consideration has been given to potential correlation or lack of correlation among key assumptions or among lines of business and coverage as described below. As a result and because there are so many other factors which affect our reserve estimate, it would be inappropriate to take the amounts described below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility in total. While we believe these are reasonably likely scenarios, the reader should not consider the following sensitivity analysis as illustrative of a reserve range. Personal and Commercial Automobile Bodily Injury reserves recorded for bodily injury on voluntary business were $437.1 million as of December 31, 2011. A key assumption for bodily injury is the inflation rate underlying the estimated reserve. A 5% change in the imbedded inflation would have changed estimated IBNR by approximately $47 million, either positive or negative, respectively, at December 31, 2011. Workers Compensation reserves recorded for workers compensation on voluntary business were $295.7 million as of December 31, 2011. A key assumption for workers compensation is the inflation rate underlying the estimated reserve. Given the long reporting pattern for this line of business, an additional key assumption is the amount of additional development required to reach full maturity, thereby reflecting ultimate costs, as represented by the tail factor. A 5% change in the imbedded inflation and a one point change to the tail factor assumption (e.g. 1.02 changed to 1.01 or 1.03) would have changed estimated IBNR by approximately $37 million, either positive or negative, at December 31, 2011. -55- Table of Contents Monoline and Multi-Peril General Liability reserves recorded for general liability on voluntary business were $275.2 million as of December 31, 2011. A key assumption for general liability is the implied adequacy of the underlying case reserves. A ten point change in case adequacy (e.g. 10% deficiency changed to 0% or 20% deficiency) would have changed estimated IBNR by approximately $19 million, either positive or negative, at December 31, 2011. Specialty Programs reserves recorded (including allocated LAE) for the AIX Companies were $162.7 million as of December 31, 2011. A key assumption for specialty programs is the expected loss and allocated LAE ratio ( ELR ) underlying the actuarial reserve analysis. A five point change to the ELR on AIX would have changed estimated IBNR by approximately $6 million at December 31, 2011. Chaucer new classes of business- an increase in the ultimate loss ratios on new classes of business (energy, engineering and international liability classes) by 5%, 10%, and 15% in the 2009 and prior, 2010, and 2011 years of account, respectively, would have increased estimated IBNR by approximately $65 million at December 31, 2011. Chaucer Syndicate 4000- a nine month delay in the reporting of claims to the assumed development of Syndicate 4000 financial institution claims and doubling the probabilities of a total indemnity loss for each and every assured with potential exposure (or claims notified) to the fraud relating to Bernard L. Madoff, would have increased estimated IBNR by approximately $48 million at December 31, 2011. Chaucer catastrophe events- assuming a 20% increase in estimated gross ultimate claim deterioration for the 2011 calendar year catastrophe events regarding the Japan and New Zealand earthquakes, Thailand, Denmark and Australia floods and Hurricane Irene, would have increased estimated IBNR by approximately $26 million at December 31, 2011. Carried Reserves and Reserve Rollforward The following table provides a reconciliation of the gross beginning and ending reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (including Chaucer with respect to the six month period ended December 31, 2011). (in millions) For the years ended December 31 2011 2010 2009 Gross loss and LAE reserves, beginning of period $ 3,277.7 $ 3,153.9 $ 3,203.1 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 1,115.5 1,060.2 988.2 Net loss and LAE reserves, beginning of period 2,162.2 2,093.7 2,214.9 Net incurred losses and LAE in respect of losses occurring in: Current year 2,654.1 1,967.4 1,794.5 Prior years (103.3 ) (111.1 ) (155.3 ) Total incurred losses and LAE 2,550.8 1,856.3 1,639.2 Net payments of losses and LAE in respect of losses occurring in: Current year 1,482.4 1,078.7 971.9 Prior years 1,010.3 738.6 788.5 Total payments 2,492.7 1,817.3 1,760.4 Purchase of Chaucer, net of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses of $669.6 1,631.0 Purchase of Campania 29.5 Effect of foreign exchange rate changes (22.8 ) Net reserve for losses and LAE, end of period 3,828.5 2,162.2 2,093.7 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 1,931.8 1,115.5 1,060.2 Gross reserve for losses and LAE, end of period $ 5,760.3 $ 3,277.7 $ 3,153.9 The table below summarizes the gross reserve for losses and LAE by line of business.

For our Commercial and Personal Lines businesses, total loss and LAE reserves increased by $149.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to growth in our Commercial Lines business and catastrophe losses in the period. Other commercial lines are primarily comprised of our professional liability, general liability, umbrella, and marine lines. Included in the above table, in the Chaucer segment, is $302.8 million of reserves related to Chaucer participation in Syndicate 4000, consisting of financial and professional liability lines written in 2008 and prior. Also included in the above table, primarily in other commercial lines, are $59.8 million, $63.9 million and $76.8 million of asbestos and environmental reserves as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Prior Year Development Loss and LAE reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by $103.3 million, $111.1 million and $155.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These amounts for 2011 include favorable loss and LAE reserve development of $34.7 million and $33.0 million, for the full year for Commercial Lines and Personal Lines, respectively, and $35.5 million for Chaucer for the six months ended December 31, 2011. The primary drivers of reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: Lower than expected losses within our personal automobile line, primarily related to bodily injury coverage in the 2008 through 2010 accident years. Lower than expected losses within our commercial multiple peril line related to the 2007 through 2010 accident years. Lower than expected losses within our workers compensation line related to the 2007 through 2010 accident years. Lower than expected losses in Chaucer energy, property and U.K. motor lines, primarily related to the 2009 and 2010 accident years. Additionally, within other commercial lines, unfavorable development in our professional liability and surety lines were partially offset by favorable development in our healthcare and other commercial property lines. The primary drivers for reserve development during the year ended December 31, 2010 were as follows: Lower than expected losses within our personal automobile line across all coverages, primarily related to the 2009 accident year. Lower than expected losses within the workers compensation line, primarily related to the 2008 and 2009 accident years. Lower than expected losses within the commercial multiple peril line in liability coverages, primarily related to the 2007 through 2009 accident years. Within our other commercial lines, our commercial umbrella line related to the 2007 through 2009 accident years contributed to the favorable development, partially offset by unfavorable development in our surety line, primarily related to the 2009 accident year. In addition, the 2010 amount includes $9.8 million of favorable development resulting from a change in the cost factors used for establishing unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves. The primary drivers for reserve development during the year ended December 31, 2009 were as follows: Lower than expected losses within the personal automobile line, primarily related to bodily injury coverage in the 2005 through 2008 accident years. Lower than expected losses within the workers compensation line, primarily in the 2000 through 2008 accident years. Lower than expected losses within the commercial multiple peril line, primarily in the 2005 through 2007 accident years. Lower than expected losses within the surety line, lower projected losses in our run-off voluntary pools and lower projected exposures to asbestos and environmental liability for our direct written business. Partially offsetting the favorable development was unfavorable non-catastrophe weather-related property loss development, primarily related to our homeowners, commercial property and personal automobile physical damage lines. In addition, in 2009, we changed our unallocated loss adjustment expense reserving methodology from that based on cash payments to that based on unit costs, which resulted in a $20.0 million benefit, of which $16.0 million related to prior years. We believe that the methodology based on unit costs is more representative of our future costs of settling our existing claims. Asbestos and Environmental Reserves Although we attempt to limit our exposures to asbestos and environmental damage liability through specific policy exclusions, we have been and may continue to be subject to claims related to these exposures. Ending loss and LAE reserves for all direct business written by our property and casualty companies related to asbestos and environmental damage liability were $10.0 million, $10.1 million and $11.3 million, net of reinsurance of $18.7 million for 2011 and $19.9 million for both 2010 and 2009. During 2011, there was minimal activity for our asbestos and environmental -57- Table of Contents reserves, resulting in a decrease of $0.1 million. During 2010, we reduced our asbestos and environmental reserves by $1.2 million due to several small settlements. In recent years, average asbestos and environmental payments have declined modestly. As a result of the declining payments, our estimate of asbestos and environmental liability reserves was lowered, resulting in favorable reserve development of $7.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. As a result of our historical direct underwriting mix of Commercial Lines policies toward smaller and middle market risks, past asbestos and environmental damage liability loss experience has remained minimal in relation to our total loss and LAE incurred experience. In addition, we have established gross loss and LAE reserves for assumed reinsurance pool business with asbestos and environmental damage liability of $31.1 million, $33.9 million and $45.6 million at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These reserves relate to pools in which we have terminated our participation; however, we continue to be subject to claims related to years in which we were a participant. Results of operations from these pools are included in our Other Property and Casualty segment. The $11.7 million decrease in these reserves during 2010 was primarily due to a large claim settlement within these pools. A significant part of our pool reserves relates to our participation in the Excess and Casualty Reinsurance Association ( ECRA ) voluntary pool from 1950 to 1982. In 1982, the pool was dissolved and since that time, the business has been in run-off. Our percentage of the total pool liabilities varied from 1% to 6% during these years. Our participation in this pool has resulted in average paid losses of approximately $2 million annually over the past ten years. During the year ended December 31, 2009, our ECRA pool reserves were lowered by $6.3 million as the result of an actuarial study completed by the ECRA pool manager. We reviewed the ECRA actuarial study, concurred that the study was reasonable, and adopted its estimate. In addition, we recorded additional favorable development of $4.3 million in the same year on a separate large claim settlement within these pools. Because of the inherent uncertainty regarding the types of claims in these pools, we cannot provide assurance that our reserves will be sufficient. We estimate our ultimate liability for asbestos, environmental and toxic tort liability claims, whether resulting from direct business, assumed reinsurance or pool business, based upon currently known facts, reasonable assumptions where the facts are not known, current law and methodologies currently available. Although these outstanding claims are not significant, their existence gives rise to uncertainty and are discussed because of the possibility that they may become significant. We believe that, notwithstanding the evolution of case law expanding liability in asbestos and environmental claims, recorded reserves related to these claims are adequate. Nevertheless, the asbestos, environmental and toxic tort liability reserves could be revised, and any such revisions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular quarterly or annual period or on our financial position. Reinsurance We maintain a reinsurance program designed to protect against large or unusual losses and LAE activity. We utilize a variety of reinsurance agreements that are intended to control our exposure to large property and casualty losses, stabilize earnings and protect capital resources, including facultative reinsurance, excess of loss reinsurance and catastrophe reinsurance. We determine the appropriate amount of reinsurance based upon our evaluation of the risks insured, exposure analyses prepared by consultants, our capital allocation models and on market conditions, including the availability and pricing of reinsurance. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our primary obligations to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to us. We believe that the terms of our reinsurance contracts are consistent with industry practice in that they contain standard terms and conditions with respect to lines of business covered, limit and retention, arbitration and occurrence. Based on an ongoing review of our reinsurers' financial statements, reported financial strength ratings from rating agencies, and the analysis and guidance of our reinsurance advisors, we believe that our reinsurers are financially sound. Catastrophe reinsurance serves to protect us, as the ceding insurer, from significant losses arising from a single event such as snow, ice storm, windstorm, hail, hurricane, tornado, riot or other extraordinary events. Although we believe our catastrophe reinsurance program, including our retention and co-participation amounts for 2011 and 2012, are appropriate given our surplus level and the current reinsurance pricing environment, there can be no assurance that our reinsurance program will provide coverage levels that will prove adequate should we experience losses from one significant or several large catastrophes during 2012. Additionally, as a result of the current economic environment, as well as, losses incurred by reinsurers in recent years, the availability and pricing of appropriate reinsurance programs may be adversely affected in future renewal periods. We may not be able to pass these costs on to policyholders in the form of higher premiums or assessments. See Reinsurance in Item 1 Business of this Form 10-K on pages 17 to 20 for further information on our reinsurance programs. -58- Table of Contents INVESTM ENTS INVESTMENT RESULTS Net investment income before taxes was $258.2 million, $247.2 million and $251.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in net investment income in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to the acquisition of Chaucer and its related investment income, which contributed $16.9 million, partially offset by the impact of lower new money yields on fixed maturities. Higher dividend income from equity securities and lower investment expenses also contributed to the increase in net investment income. The decrease in net investment income in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to the utilization of fixed maturities to fund certain corporate actions, such as stock and debt repurchases and $100 million contribution to our pension plan in January 2010. Lower new money yields also contributed to the decline. These decreases were partially offset by higher income from the investment of cash, principally into the bond market, and the investment of proceeds from our senior debt issuances. The average pre-tax earned yields on fixed maturities were 5.30%, 5.46% and 5.53% for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for the U.S. domiciled companies. Chaucer average pre-tax earned yield on fixed maturities was 2.10% for the period from acquisition at July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. We expect declines in average investment yields to continue as new money rates remain at historically low levels. INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO We held cash and investment assets diversified across several asset classes, as follows: DECEMBER 31 2011 2010 (dollars in millions) Carrying Value % of Total Carrying Value Carrying Value % of Total Carrying Value Fixed maturities, at fair value $ 6,284.7 83.3 % $ 4,797.9 91.3 % Equity securities, at fair value 246.4 3.3 128.6 2.4 Cash and cash equivalents 820.4 10.9 290.4 5.5 Other investments 190.2 2.5 39.4 0.8 Total cash and investments $ 7,541.7 100.0 % $ 5,256.3 100.0 % CASH AND INVESTMENTS Total cash and investments increased $2.3 billion, or 43.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase is attributable to the acquisition of Chaucer, with total cash and investments of $2.4 billion at December 31, 2011, consisting of $1,571.4 million of fixed maturities, $621.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, $137.8 million of other investments and $21.5 million of equity securities. Excluding Chaucer cash and investments, the investment portfolio decreased approximately 1% for the year. Our fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of corporate securities, taxable and tax-exempt municipal securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, U.S. government securities, foreign government securities and asset-backed securities.

The quality of our fixed maturity portfolio remains strong based on ratings, capital structure position, support through guarantees, underlying security, issuer diversification and yield curve position. Commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ) constitute $379.1 million of our invested assets, of which approximately 16% is fully defeased with U.S. government securities. The portfolio is seasoned, with approximately 58% of our CMBS holdings from pre-2005 vintages, 14% from the 2005 vintage, 8% from the 2007 vintage, 4% from the 2006 vintage, and 16% from 2010 and later vintages. The CMBS portfolio is of high quality, with approximately 81% being AAA rated and 19% rated AA or A. The CMBS portfolio has a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 72% and credit enhancement of approximately 27% as of December 31, 2011. Our municipal bond portfolio constitutes approximately 14% of invested assets at December 31, 2011 and is 99% investment grade, without regard to any insurance enhancement. Currently, approximately 29% of the municipal bond portfolio has an insurance enhancement. The portfolio is well diversified by geography, sector and source of payment, and consists primarily of taxable securities. Approximately 61% of the portfolio is invested in revenue bonds and 39% in general obligation bonds. Revenue bonds are backed by the revenue stream generated by the services provided by the issuer, while general obligation bonds are backed by the authority that issued the debt and are secured by the taxing powers of those authorities. Other investments consist primarily of overseas deposits, which are investments maintained in overseas funds and managed exclusively by Lloyd s. These funds are required in order to protect policyholders in overseas markets and enable our Chaucer segment to operate in those markets. Access to those funds is restricted and we have no control over the investment strategy. Also included in other investments are investments in limited partnerships, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or at cost. In addition, and in accordance with Lloyd operating guidelines, we are required to deposit funds at Lloyd to support our underwriting operations. These funds are available only to fund claim obligations. These restricted assets consisted of approximately $372 million of fixed maturities and $94 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2011. We also deposit funds with various state and governmental authorities in the U.S. For a discussion of our deposits with state, governmental and regulatory authorities, see also Note 3 Investments on pages 99 to 102 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Our fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Financial instruments whose value is determined using significant management judgment or estimation constitute less than 2% of the total assets we measured at fair value. (See also Note 5 Fair Value on pages 105 to 109 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K). Although we expect to invest new funds primarily in investment grade fixed maturities, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, a portion of funds in common equity securities and below investment grade fixed maturities and other assets. -60- Table of Contents European sovereign and non-sovereign debt exposure Our European fixed maturity credit exposure at December 31, 2011 was as follows: Non-Sovereign (in millions) Sovereign Foreign Agency Financial Non-Financial Total Country: Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value United Kingdom $ 64.4 $ 64.4 $ $ $ 315.2 $ 307.1 $ 215.2 $ 224.9 $ 594.8 $ 596.4 Germany 15.5 15.6 38.4 38.4 0.2 0.2 64.9 67.1 119.0 121.3 France 8.4 8.3 5.7 5.7 17.4 15.1 60.2 61.7 91.7 90.8 Spain 38.6 38.4 31.5 32.3 70.1 70.7 Switzerland 17.6 17.0 47.0 49.6 64.6 66.6 Netherlands 20.3 20.2 30.7 30.8 9.1 10.6 60.1 61.6 Supranationals 39.5 39.4 39.5 39.4 Sweden 1.0 1.0 11.7 11.8 12.9 13.1 25.6 25.9 Italy 3.8 3.2 18.0 16.7 21.8 19.9 Norway 11.8 11.8 3.2 3.5 15.0 15.3 Ireland 6.9 7.0 5.1 5.9 12.0 12.9 Luxembourg 12.6 12.1 12.6 12.1 Belgium 10.4 11.0 10.4 11.0 Portugal 10.9 9.7 10.9 9.7 Denmark 1.0 1.0 0.6 0.6 1.6 1.6 Total fixed maturities $ 89.3 $ 89.3 $ 116.7 $ 116.5 $ 442.1 $ 430.6 $ 501.6 $ 518.8 $ 1,149.7 $ 1,155.2 Our sovereign debt totals $89.3 million, or 1.2% of the total portfolio, and is limited to the highly rated countries of the U.K., Germany, France and Denmark. We have no sovereign debt of lower rated countries such as Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain. Our supranational and foreign agency exposure totals $116.5 million, or 1.5% of the total portfolio, and primarily consists of debt securities from the highly rated countries of Germany, Netherlands and Norway. Exposure to European banks, excluding those that are based in the U.K., totals $123.5 million, or 1.6% of investment assets. Also, we hold money market funds totaling $258.9 million, or 3.4% of the total portfolio, which are comprised of a well-diversified portfolio of short-term debt securities of predominately large financial institutions domiciled in highly rated countries. The remainder of our European non-sovereign debt exposure, excluding the U.K., is $293.9 million, which represents 3.9% of the portfolio. Generally, these securities are high quality, large cap multi-national companies that are well diversified by sector, country and issuer. The table above represents all European countries in which we have exposure. We determined country exposures based on the country of domicile for the ultimate parent company of the various issuers we hold; however, in light of the economic and financial inter-relatedness and dependencies that exist among European countries and related financial systems, economic turmoil in one country could trigger a contagion effect on other countries. We believe the quality of our European credit exposure remains sound based on ratings and issuer strength, position in the capital structure, support through guarantees and partial government ownership by highly rated countries, diversity and quality of non-financial issuers and blend of industry exposures, and yield curve position. We believe that we do not have meaningful indirect exposures in our portfolio or invest in credit derivatives. We manage our country exposure using fundamental analysis coupled with relative value considerations. Investment decisions are based on the combination of a top-down macroeconomic perspective and bottom-up credit security analysis. We monitor political and economic developments; progress toward attainment of growth and budget targets; developments related to policy, reform and regulatory initiatives from European officials; progress toward funding objectives, including the availability and cost of funding; outlook for credit ratings; ability of banks to meet increased regulatory capital standards, operate in a weakened macroeconomic environment, and maintain adequate liquidity and sufficient access to capital to meet funding requirements; and contagion throughout the financial system as evidenced by increased costs for interbank funding, lower prices for stocks and corporate bonds, as well as the availability of capital. -61- Table of Contents We actively manage our current holdings and seek securities with the best combination of credit strength and valuation. As we invest new capital, we have a defensive bias based on the uncertainty regarding the strength and duration of economic recovery, downside risks as a result of the European debt crisis and our belief that volatility will remain high based on these challenges. Accordingly, some areas of our focus include providers of essential services or products best positioned to navigate the period of weak growth; industrials with greater international exposure, either locally or via exports, particularly to the developing world, which we view more favorably based on higher growth assumptions for emerging market economies; and financial institutions best positioned regarding asset quality, liquidity and capital adequacy. Overall economic growth remains weak throughout the European region and is expected to have a dampening effect on earnings growth and credit quality for some time. Volatility remains high and European sovereign risk premiums are elevated, although down from peak levels. Many attribute the decline in risk premiums to the apparent success of the European Central Bank Long-Term Refinancing Operations ( LTRO ) since it created enough demand to lower short-term government bond yields in 2012. LTRO is designed to support banks by reducing systemic risk and thereby bank and sovereign funding. Also in 2012, several sovereign debt ratings were downgraded by Standard & Poor and Fitch, which had limited impact on sovereign yields since the bulk of these actions were anticipated by investors. Moody is assessing all European bank ratings in light of the challenges they face as a result of the crisis and expects negative rating actions on the banks most affected by the crisis, with many bank ratings likely to be placed on review for downgrade during the first quarter 2012. We do not anticipate that any such developments will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized in earnings $6.9 million of other-than-temporary impairments ( OTTI ) on fixed maturity and equity securities. OTTI on debt securities was $5.5 million, primarily on below investment grade corporate and municipal bonds that we intend to sell. Additionally, we recognized OTTI of $0.9 million related to estimated credit losses on residential mortgage-backed securities. We also recognized OTTI on a common stock of $1.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $13.9 million of OTTI on fixed maturities, certain low-income housing tax credit limited partnerships ( LIHTC ) and equity securities in earnings, of which $4.4 million related to LIHTC partnerships, $4.3 million was estimated credit losses on debt securities, $3.3 million related to debt securities classified as intend to sell and $1.9 million related to common stocks. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized OTTI of $32.9 million in earnings, which principally included losses on below investment grade corporate bonds in the industrial sector we intended to sell of $21.2 million and $9.5 million from perpetual preferred securities, primarily in the financial sector. UNREALIZED LOSSES The following table provides information about our fixed maturities and equity securities that are in an unrealized loss position. (See also Note 3 Investments on pages 99 to 102 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K). DECEMBER 31 2011 2010 (In millions) Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Fixed maturities: Investment grade: 12 months or less $ 27.1 $ 1,175.5 $ 22.9 $ 732.3 Greater than 12 months 14.3 108.9 29.7 208.2 Total investment grade fixed maturities 41.4 1,284.4 52.6 940.5 Below investment grade: 12 months or less 9.9 126.9 1.0 51.1 Greater than 12 months 3.7 14.7 12.0 90.0 Total below investment grade fixed maturities 13.6 141.6 13.0 141.1 Equity securities: 12 months or less 8.8 87.2 1.9 45.8 Total $ 63.8 $ 1,513.2 $ 67.5 $ 1,127.4 -62- Table of Contents Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities decreased $3.7 million, or 5.5%, to $63.8 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $67.5 million at December 31, 2010. The decrease in unrealized losses was primarily attributable to lower interest rates, partially offset by greater equity losses and widening of credit spreads across all sectors. At December 31, 2011, gross unrealized losses consist primarily of $40.3 million of corporate fixed maturities, $9.4 million of mortgage-backed securities, $8.8 million of equity securities, and $3.9 million in municipal securities. We view the gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities as being temporary since it is our assessment that these securities will recover in the near term, allowing us to realize their anticipated long-term economic value. With respect to gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities, we do not intend to sell, nor is it more likely than not we will be required to sell, such debt securities before this expected recovery of amortized cost (See also Liquidity and Capital Resources on pages 75 to 79 of this Form 10-K.). With respect to equity securities, we have the intent and ability to retain such investments for the period of time anticipated to allow for this expected recovery in fair value. The risks inherent in our assessment methodology include the risk that, subsequent to the balance sheet date, market factors may differ from our expectations; the global economic recovery is less robust than we expect or reverts to recessionary trends; we may decide to subsequently sell a security for unforeseen business needs; or changes in the credit assessment or equity characteristics from our original assessment may lead us to determine that a sale at the current value would maximize recovery on such investments. To the extent that there are such adverse changes, an OTTI would be recognized as a realized loss. Although unrealized losses are not reflected in the results of financial operations until they are realized or deemed other-than-temporary , the fair value of the underlying investment, which does reflect the unrealized loss, is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table sets forth gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities by maturity period and for equity securities at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations, with or without call or prepayment penalties, or we may have the right to put or sell the obligations back to the issuers. 000,000 000,000 DECEMBER 31 2011 2010 (in millions) Due in one year or less $ 1.9 $ 2.6 Due after one year through five years 18.9 11.4 Due after five years through ten years 11.2 17.1 Due after ten years 12.9 21.6 44.9 52.7 Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities 10.1 12.9 Total fixed maturities 55.0 65.6 Equity securities 8.8 1.9 Total fixed maturities and equity securities $ 63.8 $ 67.5 The carrying values of defaulted fixed maturity securities on non-accrual status at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were not material. The effects of non-accruals compared with amounts that would have been recognized in accordance with the original terms of the fixed maturities, were reductions in net investment income of $2.3 million for both years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Any defaults in the fixed maturities portfolio in future periods may negatively affect investment income. Our investment portfolio and shareholders equity can be significantly impacted by changes in market values of our securities. As the U.S. and global financial markets and economies remain unstable, market volatility could increase and defaults on fixed income securities could occur. As a result, we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and/or financial position. Fiscal and monetary policies in place, primarily in the United States and Europe, are supportive of moderate economic growth. The removal or modification of these policies could have an adverse effect on issuers level of business activity or liquidity, increasing the probability of future defaults. While we may experience defaults on fixed income securities, particularly with respect to non-investment grade securities, it is difficult to foresee which issuers, industries or markets will be affected. As a result, the value of our fixed maturity portfolio could change rapidly in ways we cannot currently anticipate. Depending on market conditions, we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods. -63- Table of Contents DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS We maintain an overall risk management strategy that can incorporate the use of derivative instruments to manage significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by foreign currency and interest rate volatility. In April 2011, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract to hedge the foreign currency exchange risk embedded in the purchase price of Chaucer, which was denominated in U.K. pound sterling ( GBP ). This contract had a notional amount of 297.9 million and was settled on July 14, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized a loss of $11.3 million in income from continuing operations. The loss on the contract was due to a decrease in the exchange rate between the GBP and the U.S. dollar, but was more than offset by the lower U.S. dollars required to meet the GBP-based purchase price. Since a foreign currency hedge in which the hedged item is a forecasted transaction relating to a business combination does not qualify for hedge accounting under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ( ASC 815 ), we did not apply hedge accounting to this transaction. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations on pages 96 to 98 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for additional information. In May 2011, we entered into a treasury lock forward agreement to hedge the interest rate risk associated with our planned issuance of senior debt, which was completed on June 17, 2011. This hedge qualified as a cash flow hedge under ASC 815. It matured in June 2011 and resulted in a loss of $1.9 million, which was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized in earnings over the term of the senior notes. Additionally, Chaucer held foreign currency forward contracts utilized to mitigate changes in fair value caused by foreign currency fluctuation in converting the fair value of GBP and Euro denominated investment portfolios into their U.S. dollar denominated equivalent. These portfolios supported U.S. dollar denominated claim reserve liabilities. We recognized a gain of $6.1 million related to these instruments. All Chaucer forward contracts were terminated in October 2011. OTHER ITEMS Net income also includes the following items: (in millions) Commercial Lines Personal Lines Chaucer Other Property and Casualty Discontinued Operations Total 2011 Net realized investment gains $ 4.7 $ 4.0 $ 6.7 $ 12.7 $ $ 28.1 Net gain (loss) from retirement of debt 0.3 (2.6 ) (2.3 ) Costs related to acquired businesses (16.4 ) (16.4 ) Loss on derivative instruments (11.3 ) (11.3 ) Net foreign exchange gains 6.7 6.7 Discontinued operations, net of taxes 5.2 5.2 2010 Net realized investment gains (losses) $ 13.3 $ 17.8 $ $ (1.4 ) $ $ 29.7 Loss from retirement of debt (2.0 ) (2.0 ) Discontinued operations, net of taxes 1.6 1.6 2009 Net realized investment gains (losses) $ 0.3 $ (0.8 ) $ $ 1.9 $ $ 1.4 Gain from retirement of debt 34.5 34.5 Discontinued operations, net of taxes 9.4 9.4 -64- Table of Contents We manage investment assets for our Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, and Other Property and Casualty segments based on the requirements of our U.S. combined property and casualty companies. We allocate the investment income, expenses and realized gains to our Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Other Property and Casualty segments based on actuarial information related to the underlying businesses. We manage investment assets separately for our Chaucer segment. Net realized gains on investments were $28.1 million, $29.7 million, and $1.4 million for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Net realized gains in 2011 are primarily due to $27.7 million of gains recognized from the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities and $6.1 million of gains on foreign currency hedges, partially offset by $6.9 million of other-than-temporary impairments from fixed maturities and equity securities. Net realized gains in 2010 are due to $43.6 million of gains recognized, primarily from the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities, partially offset by $13.9 million of other-than-temporary impairments from fixed maturities, low-income housing tax partnerships and equity securities. Net realized investment gains in 2009 resulted from $34.3 million of gains recognized principally from the sale of fixed maturities, partially offset by $32.9 million of other-than-temporary impairments from both fixed maturities and equity securities. In 2011, we repurchased in several transactions, $69.5 million of our Series B 8.207% Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures ( Junior Debentures ) at a cost of $72.1 million, resulting in a net loss of $2.6 million on the repurchases. In addition, we repurchased $8.0 million of capital securities related to AIX Holdings, Inc. ( AIX ) at a cost of $7.7 million, resulting in a gain of $0.3 million. The net loss on all debt repurchases in 2011 was $2.3 million. In 2010, we repurchased $36.5 million of these Junior Debentures at a cost of $38.5 million, resulting in a loss of $2.0 million on the repurchase. During 2009, we completed a cash tender offer to repurchase a portion of our 8.207% Series B Capital Securities due in 2027 that were issued by AFC Capital Trust I (subsequently redeemed and exchanged for Junior Debentures) and a portion of our 7.625% Senior Debentures due in 2025 that were issued by THG. AFC Capital Trust I was subsequently liquidated as of July 30, 2009. As a result of these actions and including securities repurchased prior and subsequent to the tender offer, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $34.5 million in 2009. Acquisition costs were $16.4 million for 2011 and primarily consist of advisory, legal, and accounting costs associated with the acquisition of Chaucer. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations on pages 96 to 98 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. In connection with the acquisition of Chaucer, we entered into a foreign exchange forward contract, which was settled in July 2011 at a loss of $11.3 million. See Investments on pages 59 to 64 of this Form 10-K. The loss on the contract was offset by the lower U.S. dollars required to meet the GBP based purchase price, which resulted in a $6.4 million gain on foreign exchange. Additional decreases in the exchange rate occurred subsequent to payment of cash proceeds on July 14, 2011. Gains of $0.3 million were recognized related to the loan notes that are due in GBP to certain former shareholders of Chaucer common stock for the year ended December 31, 2011. We will be subject to fluctuations in the currency until such loan notes have been paid. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Discontinued operations consist of: (i) Discontinued First Allmerica Financial Life Insurance Company ( FAFLIC ) Business, including both the loss associated with the sale of FAFLIC on January 2, 2009 and the loss or income resulting from its prior business operations; (ii) Discontinued Operations of our Variable Life Insurance and Annuity Business in 2005; and (iii) Discontinued Accident and Health Business. Discontinued FAFLIC and Variable Life Insurance and Annuity Business On January 2, 2009, we sold our remaining life insurance subsidiary, FAFLIC, to Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company ( Commonwealth Annuity ), a subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc, ( Goldman Sachs ). Previously, on December 30, 2005, we sold our variable life insurance and annuity business to Goldman Sachs, including the reinsurance of 100% of the variable business of FAFLIC. We agreed to indemnify Commonwealth Annuity and Goldman Sachs for certain litigation, regulatory matters and other liabilities relating to the pre-closing activities of the businesses that were sold. As of December 31, 2011, our total gross liability related to these guarantees was $3.8 million. We regularly review and update this liability for legal and regulatory matter indemnities. Although we believe our current estimate for this liability is appropriate, there can be no assurance that these estimates will not materially increase in the future. Adjustments to this reserve are recorded in our results in the period in which they are determined. -65- Table of Contents In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized a gain of $4.0 million, $1.8 million and $12.0 million, respectively, related to the sale of FAFLIC and the variable life insurance and annuity business. These gains were primarily due to reductions in the estimate of indemnification liabilities related to the sales. Gains in 2011 also included $1.7 million related to a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) related to tax years 2005 and 2006 and other tax related items. See also Income Taxes on pages 68 and 69 of this Form 10-K. Discontinued Accident and Health Insurance Business The discontinued accident and health business had no significant financial results that impacted 2011 or 2010. The loss of $2.6 million in 2009 was primarily from net realized investment losses resulting from other-than-temporary impairments. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY Our operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations which may adversely impact the valuation of the investment portfolio. In a rising interest rate environment, the value of the fixed income sector, which comprises 83% of our investment portfolio, may decline as a result of decreases in the fair value of the securities. Our intent is to hold securities to maturity and recover the decline in valuation as prices accrete to par. However, our intent may change prior to maturity due to changes in the financial markets, our analysis of an issuer's credit metrics and prospects, or as a result of changes in cash flow needs. Interest rate fluctuations may also reduce net investment income and as a result, profitability. The portfolio may realize lower yields and therefore lower net investment income on securities because the securities with prepayment and call features may prepay at a different rate than originally projected. In a declining interest rate environment, prepayments and calls may increase as issuers exercise their option to refinance at lower rates. The resulting funds would be reinvested at lower yields. In a rising interest rate environment, the funds may not be available to invest at higher interest rates. The following table illustrates the estimated impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2011 of hypothetical changes in prevailing interest rates, defined as changes in interest rates on U.S. Treasury debt. It does not reflect changes in credit spreads, liquidity spreads and other factors that affect the value of securities. Since changes in prevailing interest rates are often accompanied by changes in these other factors, the reader should not assume that an actual change in interest rates would result in the values illustrated.

The asset allocation process takes into consideration the types of business written and the level of surplus required to support our different businesses and the risk return profiles of the underlying asset classes. We look to balance the goals of capital preservation, net investment income stability, liquidity and total return. The majority of our assets are invested in the fixed income markets. Through fundamental research and credit analysis, our investment professionals seek to identify a portfolio of stable income-producing higher quality U.S. government, foreign government, municipal, corporate, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities, as well as undervalued securities in the credit markets balanced by strong relative value characteristics. We have a general policy of diversifying investments both within and across major investment and industrial sectors to mitigate credit and interest rate risk. We monitor the credit quality of our investments and our exposure to individual markets, borrowers, industries, sectors and, in the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities, property types and geographic locations. In addition, we currently carry debt which is subject to interest rate risk, which was issued at fixed interest rates between 5.50% and 8.207%. Current market conditions do not allow for us to invest assets at similar rates of return; therefore, our earnings on a similar level of assets are not sufficient to cover our current debt interest costs. The following tables for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. -66- Table of Contents The tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturities. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties, or we may have the right to put or sell the obligations back to the issuers. Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are included in the category representing their expected maturity. Available-for-sale securities include both U.S. and foreign-denominated fixed maturities. Additionally, we have assumed our available-for-sale securities are similar enough to aggregate those securities for presentation purposes. Specifically, variable rate available-for-sale securities comprise an immaterial portion of the portfolio and do not have a significant impact on weighted-average interest rates. Therefore, the variable rate investments are not presented separately; instead they are included in the tables at their current interest rate. Debt is presented at contractual maturities, except for the debt for previously acquired subsidiaries. We have presented this debt in the category that reflects the more likely payments, which is expected to be earlier than their contractual maturities.

Portfolio characteristics are analyzed regularly and price risk is actively managed through a variety of techniques. At December 31, 2011, a hypothetical increase or decrease of 10% in the market price of our equity securities would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio of approximately $25 million. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease at December 31, 2010 would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio of $13 million. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK Our Chaucer segment has exposure to foreign currency risk, most notably in its insurance contracts and its invested assets. Some of its insurance contracts provide that ultimate losses may be payable in foreign currencies depending on the country of original loss. Foreign currency exchange rate risk exists to the extent that there is an increase in the exchange rate of the foreign currency in which losses are ultimately owed. Thus, our Chaucer segment attempts to manage its foreign currency risk by seeking to match its liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with cash and investments that are denominated in such currencies. We may also utilize foreign currency forward contracts as part of our investment strategy. The principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for us are the U.K. pound sterling and the Canadian dollar. A hypothetical 10% -67- Table of Contents reduction in the value of foreign denominated investments would be expected to produce a loss in fair value of approximately $128 million at December 31, 2011. In 2010, we did not have material exposure to foreign currency related risk. INCOME TAXES We are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign countries in which we operate. We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return that includes the holding company and its U.S. subsidiaries. Generally, taxes are accrued at the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% for income from the U.S. operations. Our primary non-U.S. jurisdiction is the U.K. with a 26% rate. The U.K. statutory rate decreases from 26% to 25% effective April 1, 2012. We accrue taxes on certain non-U.S. income, which is subject to U.S. tax as a result of being owned by a U.S. shareholder at the U.S. rate. Foreign tax credits, where available, are utilized to offset U.S. tax as permitted. Certain of our non-U.S. income is not subject to U.S. tax until repatriated. Foreign taxes on this non-U.S. income are accrued at the local foreign rate and do not have an accrual for U.S. deferred taxes since these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested overseas. The benefit for income taxes from continuing operations was $9.6 million in 2011 and the provision for income taxes from continuing operations were $57.9 million and $83.1 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. These amounts resulted in consolidated effective federal tax rates of (43.0)%, 27.4%, and 30.7% on pre-tax income for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. These provisions reflect the decreases in our valuation allowance related to capital loss carryforwards of $7.5 million, $9.7 million, and $6.9 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. In addition, the 2011 and 2010 provisions reflect benefits related to tax planning strategies implemented in prior years of $9.5 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Absent these benefits, the provision for income taxes for 2011, 2010, and 2009 would have been $7.4 million or 33.2%, $70.8 million or 33.5%, and $90.0 million or 33.2%, respectively. Our income tax expense on segment income was $2.9 million for 2011, compared to $61.2 million for 2010 and $77.5 million in 2009. The decreases in 2011 and 2010 are primarily due to lower segment income. Included in our deferred tax net asset as of December 31, 2011 is an asset of $31.7 million related to U.S. capital loss carryforwards. Our pre-tax capital losses carried forward are $90.5 million, including $80.0 million resulting from the sale of FAFLIC in 2009. At December 31, 2011, we have a full valuation allowance against this asset, since it is our opinion that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. In addition, at December 31, 2011, we have a deferred tax asset of $33.6 million related to U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and we have a deferred tax asset of $14.5 million related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards. Our pre-tax U.S. operating loss carryforward of $95.9 will expire beginning in 2031. Our pre-tax foreign operating loss carryforwards of $62.1 million were generated in the U.K. and have no expiration date. It is our opinion that there will be sufficient future U.S. and U.K. taxable income to utilize these loss carryforwards. Our estimate of the gross amount and likely realization of loss carryforwards may change over time. As of December 31, 2011, we have a deferred tax asset of $112.2 million of alternative minimum tax ( AMT ) credit carryforwards. We expect to utilize these tax credits during the next four to five years. The result of their utilization will be a lower current tax rate offset by a higher deferred tax provision, and also lower cash expenditures for federal income taxes during the utilization period. Once the minimum tax credits have been fully utilized, we expect our current tax rate to be closer to the statutory rate of 35%. Although there is no expiration on AMT credit carryforwards, we cannot be certain that we will utilize them as quickly as our expectations. In September 2011, we completed a transaction which resulted in the realization, for tax purposes only, of unrealized gains in our investment portfolio of $98.4 million. This transaction enabled us to realize capital loss carryforwards to offset this gain, and resulted in the release of $29.0 million of the valuation allowance we held against the deferred tax asset related to these capital loss carryforwards. A release of $0.2 million was reflected in income from continuing operations and the remaining amount of $28.8 million was reflected as a benefit in accumulated other comprehensive income. This amount will be released into income from continuing operations, related to non-segment income, in future years, as the investment securities subject to these transactions are sold or mature. During 2011, we reduced the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset by $55.6 million, from $91.5 million to $35.9 million. There were four principal components to this reduction. First, we decreased the valuation allowance by $29.0 million as a result of the transactions described above which utilized our capital loss carryforwards. Second, we decreased the valuation allowance by $21.9 million on certain unrealized losses as a result of unrealized appreciation in our investment portfolio. This decrease was reflected as an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income. Third, as a result of $28.1 million in net realized gains during 2011, we decreased the valuation allowance by $7.5 million as an increase to income from continuing operations, since these gains utilized our capital loss carryforwards. Fourth, in the 2010 U.S. federal income tax return, we were able to utilize an additional $7.6 million of capital loss carryforwards that expired in 2010. -68- Table of Contents As such, we increased the valuation allowance by $2.6 million with an equal and offsetting increase to the related deferred tax asset. The remaining increase of $0.2 million was attributable to other items reflected as expense from discontinued operations. In November 2011, we reached an agreement with the IRS on our 2005 to 2006 audit cycle, resulting in a tax benefit of $2.1 million recognized as income related to our discontinued operations. The benefit is primarily due to the concession of our separate account dividends received deduction issue by the IRS Appeals Division, which resulted in the reduction of our liability for this uncertain tax position. See Note 7 Income Taxes on pages 111 to 113 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. for additional information. Also in April 2011, we received notification that an interest refund claim filed with the Internal Revenue Service in 2009 had been accepted, resulting in a tax benefit of $0.6 million recognized in discontinued operations. In 2009, a benefit of $0.2 million resulting from the settlement with the IRS of interest claims for 1977 through 1981 was recognized in discontinued operations as income. In January, July, September, and December 2010, we completed transactions which resulted in the realization, for tax purposes only, of unrealized gains in our investment portfolio of $98.4 million, $37.1 million, $31.1 million, and $120.8 million, respectively. These transactions enabled us to realize capital loss carryforwards to offset these gains, and resulted in the release of $66.2 million and $34.4 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, of the valuation allowance we held against the deferred tax asset related to these capital loss carryforwards. The total release of $100.6 million was accounted for as an increase in income from continuing operations of $3.2 million and $6.0 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, with the remaining $91.4 million reflected as a benefit in accumulated and other comprehensive income at December 31, 2010. During 2011, we recognized $9.5 million of the $91.4 million in income from continuing operations, related to non-segment income. The remaining amount will be released into income from continuing operations in future years, as the investment securities subject to these transactions are sold or mature. In 2010, we reduced the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset by a total of $104.1 million, from $195.6 million to $91.5 million. There were four principal components to this reduction. First, we reduced the valuation allowance by $66.2 million as a result of the transactions described above which utilized our capital loss carryforwards. Second, we increased the valuation allowance by $20.3 million for certain tax basis unrealized losses which we did not believe we could utilize. This increase was reflected as a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income. Third, $135.5 million of our capital loss carryforwards expired in 2010. As a result, we released the $47.4 million of the valuation allowance attributable to these expirations with an equal and offsetting reduction in the related deferred tax asset. Fourth, as a result of $29.7 million in net realized capital gains, we decreased our valuation allowance by $9.7 million as an increase to income from continuing operations since these gains utilized our capital loss carryforwards. The remaining $1.1 million decrease was attributable to other items reflected as income from discontinued operations. In January 2010, we made a $100.0 million pension contribution, which resulted in both a current deduction of $35.0 million and the utilization (reduction) of a deferred tax asset of the same amount. This contribution is the most significant reason the current tax expense is $5.7 million in 2010, representing only approximately 10% of the total provision for federal income taxes from continuing operations. During 2009, we reduced the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset by $152.6 million, from $348.2 million to $195.6 million. There were two principal components to this reduction. First, we reversed, through other comprehensive income, the $118.4 million valuation allowance that we had recognized at December 31, 2008 associated with the tax benefit related to the net unrealized depreciation in our investment portfolio at that time. During 2009, appreciation in the portfolio changed the nature of the tax attribute from that of an asset to that of a liability, and thus, there was no longer a need for that portion of the valuation allowance. Second, as a result of the aforementioned transactions, we reversed $28.4 million of the valuation allowance as an adjustment to other comprehensive income and $6.0 million of the valuation allowance as an adjustment to income from continuing operations. The remaining $0.2 million net increase in our valuation allowance was attributable to other items, and reflected as a $0.9 million increase in income from continuing operations and a $1.1 million decrease in income from discontinued operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements. These statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during -69- Table of Contents the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following critical accounting estimates are those which we believe affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. Additional information about our other significant accounting policies and estimates may be found in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data on pages 89 to 96 of this Form 10-K. RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES See Segment Results Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses on pages 49 to 58 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of our critical accounting estimates for loss reserves. REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE BALANCES We share a significant amount of insurance risk of the primary underlying contracts with various insurance entities through the use of reinsurance contracts. As a result, when we experience loss events that are subject to a reinsurance contract, reinsurance recoveries are recorded. The amount of the reinsurance recoverable can vary based on the size of the individual loss or the aggregate amount of all losses in a particular line, book of business or an aggregate amount associated with a particular accident year. The valuation of losses recoverable depends on whether the underlying loss is a reported loss, or an incurred but not reported loss. For reported losses, we value reinsurance recoverables at the time the underlying loss is recognized, in accordance with contract terms. For incurred but not reported losses, we estimate the amount of reinsurance recoverable based on the terms of the reinsurance contracts and historical reinsurance recovery information and apply that information to the gross loss reserve estimates. The most significant assumption we use is the average size of the individual losses for those claims that have occurred but have not yet been recorded by us. The reinsurance recoverable is based on what we believe are reasonable estimates and is disclosed separately on the financial statements. However, the ultimate amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled. Reinsurance recoverables recorded on insurance losses ceded under reinsurance contracts are subject to judgments and uncertainties similar to those involved in estimating gross loss reserves, as disclosed above. In addition to these uncertainties, our reinsurance recoverables may prove uncollectible if the reinsurers are unable or unwilling to perform under the reinsurance contracts. In establishing our reinsurance allowance for amounts deemed uncollectible, we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentration of credit risk arising from our exposure to individual reinsurers. To determine if an allowance is necessary, we consider, among other factors, published financial information, reports from rating agencies, payment history, collateral held and our legal right to offset balances recoverable against balances we may owe. Our reinsurance allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to uncertainty and volatility due to the time lag involved in collecting amounts recoverable from reinsurers. Over the period of time that losses occur, reinsurers are billed and amounts are ultimately collected, economic conditions, as well as the operational and financial performance of particular reinsurers, may change and these changes may affect the reinsurers' willingness and ability to meet their contractual obligation to us. It is also difficult to fully evaluate the impact of major catastrophic events on the financial stability of reinsurers, as well as the access to capital that reinsurers may have when such events occur. The ceding of insurance does not legally discharge us from our primary liability for the full amount of the policies, and we will be required to pay the loss and bear collection risk even if the reinsurers fail to meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS General We currently have a U.S. qualified defined benefit plan, a defined benefit pension plan for our international subsidiary, Chaucer, and several smaller qualified and non qualified benefit plans. We account for our pension plans in accordance with ASC 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits . In order to measure the liabilities and expense associated with these plans, we must make various estimates and key assumptions, including discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, employee turnover rates and anticipated mortality rates. Additionally, our Chaucer pension plan also must take into consideration inflation rates, specifically related to participant salary increases. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed at least annually and are based on our historical experience, as well as current facts and circumstances. In addition, we use outside actuaries to assist in measuring the expenses and liabilities associated with our defined benefit pension plans. Two significant assumptions used in the determination of benefit plan obligations and expenses that are dependent on market factors, which have been subject to a greater level of volatility over the past few years, are the discount rate and the return on plan asset assumptions. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows as a present value on the measurement date. We also use this -70- Table of Contents discount rate in the determination of our pre-tax pension expense or benefit. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. To determine the expected long-term return on plan assets, we generally consider historical mean returns by asset class for passive indexed strategies, as well as current and expected asset allocations, and adjust for certain factors that we believe will have an impact on future returns. Actual returns on plan assets in any given year seldom result in the achievement of the expected rate of return on assets. Actual returns on plan assets in excess of these expected returns will generally reduce our net actuarial losses (or increase actuarial gains) that are reflected in our accumulated other comprehensive income balance in shareholders equity, whereas actual returns on plan assets which are less than expected returns will generally increase our net actuarial losses (or decrease actuarial gains) that are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. These gains or losses are amortized into expense in future years. Expenses related to these plans are generally calculated based upon information available at the beginning of the plan year. Our pre-tax expense related to our defined benefit plans was $13.0 million and $12.9 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Expenses in 2011 include $0.4 million related to the Chaucer pension plan for the period of July 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011. U.S. Qualified Defined Benefit Plan Prior to 2005, we provided pension retirement benefits to substantially all of our U.S. employees based on a defined benefit cash balance formula. In addition to the cash balance allocation, certain transition group employees, who had met specified age and service requirements as of December 31, 1994, were eligible for a grandfathered benefit based primarily on the employees years of service and compensation during their highest five consecutive plan years of employment. As of January 1, 2005, the defined benefit pension plans were frozen. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we determined our discount rate utilizing an independent yield curve which provides for a portfolio of high quality bonds that are expected to match the cash flows of our pension plan. Bond information used in the yield curve included only those rated Aa or better as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and had been rated by at least two well-known rating agencies. At December 31, 2011, based upon our qualified plan liabilities and cash flows in relation to this discount curve, we decreased our discount rate to 5.125%, from 5.625% at December 31, 2010. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the expected rate of return on our qualified plan assets was 6.50% and 7.00%, respectively. The decrease reflects our strategy to shift investment assets from equity securities to fixed maturity investments over several years resulting in our composition of 82% fixed maturities and 18% equities at December 31, 2011, as well as declines in the fixed maturities markets in general. Actual returns of the plan investments generated approximately $58 million and $56 million of gains during 2011 and 2010, respectively, as compared to expected returns of approximately $34 million and $35 million, respectively. The benefit from the investment gains experienced in 2011 was essentially offset by a decrease in the discount rate from the prior year. In 2010, an actuarial loss of approximately $32 million primarily resulting from a decrease in the discount rate from the prior year was partially offset by the benefit from investment gains of approximately $21 million. These net losses resulted in adjustments to our accumulated net actuarial losses in 2011 and 2010 of approximately $0.4 million and $10.7 million, respectively, which are reflected as decreases to our accumulated other comprehensive income. The change in these actuarial gains and losses is amortized into earnings in future years. The adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income from these actuarial losses occurring in 2011 and 2010 were offset by the amortization of actuarial losses from prior years of $14.0 million and $15.8 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Given the effect of our actual investment experience in 2011, and taking into consideration the decrease in discount rates in 2012, U.S. pension related expenses in 2012 are expected to decrease from 2011. Accordingly, we expect our pre-tax pension expense for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan to decrease from approximately $9 million in 2011 to approximately $6 million in 2012. Holding all other assumptions constant, sensitivity to changes in our key assumptions related to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan are as follows: Discount Rate A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our pension expense in 2012 by $1.9 million and decrease our projected benefit obligation by $12.7 million. A 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase our pension expense by $1.9 million and increase our projected benefit obligation by $13.3 million. Expected Return on Plan Assets A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would decrease or increase our pension expense in 2012 by $1.4 million. -71- Table of Contents Chaucer Pension Plan Prior to 2002, our Chaucer segment provided defined benefit pension retirement benefits to certain of its employees. As of December 31, 2001, the defined benefit section of the pension plan was closed to new members. The defined benefit obligation for this plan is based on the employees years of service and final pensionable salary. As of December 31, 2011 and the July 1, 2011 acquisition date, we determined our discount rate utilizing a 15 Year AA corporate bond index. At December 31, 2011, based upon our Chaucer plan liabilities and cash flows in relation to this index, we decreased our discount rate to 4.90%, from 5.50%, at the July 1, 2011 acquisition date. For the six months ended December 31, 2011, the expected rate of return on plan assets was 7.40%. The composition of our Chaucer plan assets are 78% equities, 12% fixed maturities, and 10% real estate funds at December 31, 2011. Actual returns of the plan investments generated approximately $4.5 million of losses during the six months ended December 31, 2011. Collectively, investment losses experienced in 2011, combined with the decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by a decrease in the inflation rate and changes in other assumptions, resulted in net actuarial losses for the Chaucer plan of approximately $14.1 million. These losses are reflected as a decrease to our accumulated other comprehensive income. This balance is amortized into earnings in future periods. Taking into consideration actual investment performance and the decrease in discount rates in 2012, pension related expenses for the Chaucer plan are expected to increase in 2012 from $0.4 million to approximately $1.8 million (using the December 31, 2011 GBP to U.S. dollar conversion rate of 1.55). Holding all other assumptions constant, sensitivity to changes in our key assumptions related to our Chaucer pension plan are as follows: Discount Rate A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our pension expense in 2012 by $0.1 million and decrease our projected benefit obligation by $6.4 million. A 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase our pension expense by $0.1 million and increase our projected benefit obligation by $7.0 million. Expected Return on Plan Assets A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would decrease or increase our pension expense in 2012 by $0.1 million. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS We employ a systematic methodology to evaluate declines in fair values below amortized cost for all fixed maturity and equity security investments. The methodology utilizes a quantitative and qualitative process which seeks to ensure that available evidence concerning the declines in fair value below amortized cost is evaluated in a disciplined manner. In determining whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost is other-than-temporary, we evaluate several factors and circumstances, including the issuer overall financial condition; the issuer credit and financial strength ratings; the issuer financial performance, including earnings trends, dividend payments and asset quality; any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer; the general outlook for market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates; and the length of time and the degree to which the fair value of an issuer securities remains below our cost. With respect to fixed maturity investments, we consider factors that might raise doubt about the issuer ability to pay amounts due according to the contractual terms and whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. With respect to equity securities, we consider our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery in value. We apply these factors to all securities. We monitor corporate fixed maturity securities with unrealized losses on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration as evidenced by ratings downgrades, unexpected price variances, and/or company or industry specific concerns. We apply consistent standards of credit analysis which includes determining whether the issuer is current on its contractual payments and we consider past events, current conditions and reasonable forecasts to evaluate whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. We utilize valuation declines as a potential indicator of credit deterioration and apply additional levels of scrutiny in our analysis as the severity of the decline increases or duration persists. For our impairment review of asset-backed fixed maturity securities, we forecast our best estimate of the prospective future cash flows of the security to determine if we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Our analysis includes estimates of underlying collateral default rates based on historical and projected delinquency rates and estimates of the amount and timing of potential recovery. We consider available information relevant to the collectibility of cash flows, including information about the payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, the financial condition of the underlying -72- Table of Contents borrowers, collateral trustee reports, credit ratings analysis and other market data when developing our estimate of the expected cash flows. When an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security occurs, and we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost of the security is reduced to its fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings, which reduces net income and earnings per share. If we do not intend to sell the fixed maturity investment or more likely than not will not be required to sell it, we separate the other-than-temporary impairment into the amount we estimate represents the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of the estimated loss attributable to credit is recognized in earnings, which reduces net income and earnings per share. The amount of the estimated other-than-temporary impairment that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. We estimate the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment that relates to credit by comparing the amortized cost of the debt maturity security with the net present value of the debt security projected future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the investment prior to impairment. The non-credit portion of the impairment is equal to the difference between the fair value and the net present value of the fixed maturity security at the impairment measurement date. Other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities are recorded as realized losses, which reduce net income and earnings per share. The new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value. For equity method investments, we recognize impairment when evidence demonstrates that a loss in value that is other-than-temporary has occurred. Evidence of a loss in value that is other-than-temporary may include the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or the inability of the investee to sustain a level of earnings that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. During each period, we evaluate whether an impairment indicator has occurred that may have a significant adverse affect on the carrying value of the investment. Impairment indicators may include: lower expectations of residual value from a limited partnership, reduced valuations of the investments held by limited partnerships, actual recent cash flows that are significantly less than expected cash flows or any other adverse events since the last financial statements received that might affect the value of the investee capital. Other-than-temporary impairments of limited partnerships are recorded as realized losses, which reduce net income and earnings per share. Temporary declines in market value are recorded as unrealized losses, which do not affect net income and earnings per share, but reduce accumulated other comprehensive income, which is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We cannot provide assurance that the other-than-temporary impairments will be adequate to cover future losses or that we will not have substantial additional impairments in the future. (See Investments on pages 59 to 64 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding other-than-temporary impairments and securities in an unrealized loss position). DEFERRED TAX ASSETS Our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and loss and tax credit carryforwards. These temporary differences are measured at the balance sheet date using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction. Consideration is given to available positive and negative evidence, including reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income in each tax jurisdiction, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. Valuation allowances are established if, based on the weight of available information, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions. Our judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and specific industry and investment market conditions. Changes in valuation allowances are generally reflected in federal income tax expense or as an adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss) depending on the nature of the item for which the valuation allowance is being recorded. -73- Table of Contents The following are the components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities with the associated valuation allowance as of December 31, 2011. Deferred Tax Assets (Liabilities) Gross Amount Valuation Allowance Net Amount (in millions) Tax attributes Tax credit carryforwards $ 112.2 $ $ 112.2 Operating loss carryforwards 48.1 48.1 Capital loss carryforwards 31.7 (31.7 ) 192.0 (31.7 ) 160.3 Other Insurance reserves, net 178.9 178.9 Deferred policy acquisition costs (123.7 ) (123.7 ) Employee benefit plans 36.2 36.2 Software capitalization (29.9 ) (29.9 ) Lloyd underwriting losses (not subject to tax) 18.6 18.6 Other, net 14.5 14.5 Investments, net 9.3 (4.2 ) 5.1 103.9 (4.2 ) 99.7 Total $ 295.9 $ (35.9 ) $ 260.0 We have $112.2 million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards. The alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards have no expiration date and may be used to offset regular federal income taxes due from future income. Based on our projected future taxable income, we expect to utilize these tax credits during the next four to five years. In addition, we have operating loss carryforwards that relate to current year U.S. net operating loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards from our recently acquired Chaucer segment. The U.S. net operating loss carryforwards expire in 2031 and the Chaucer net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. Based on our projection of future economic conditions, taxable income, reversals of existing taxable temporary liabilities, and our strategic planning strategies, we believe that these operating loss carryforwards will be fully realized. Our capital loss carryforwards relate to the loss from the sale of FAFLIC in 2009 and expire in 2014. In making our valuation allowance assessment for this deferred tax asset, we considered our carryforward capacity, reversals of deferred tax liabilities related to our investment portfolio, and tax planning strategies that include holding a portion of debt securities with market value losses until recovery and selling appreciated securities to offset capital losses. Given the nature and the magnitude of the loss and our ability to generate limited capital gains based on current market conditions in the next three years, we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. We believe the remaining deferred tax asset from other temporary differences will be fully realizable based on our projected future taxable income and recent financial operations. Although we believe that these assets are fully recoverable, there can be no certainty that future events will not affect their recoverability. Future economic conditions and debt market volatility, including increase in interest rates, can adversely impact our tax planning strategies. STATUTORY SURPLUS OF U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES The following table reflects statutory surplus for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries: December 31 2011 2010 (in millions) Total Statutory Surplus U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries $ 1,582.8 $ 1,747.3 The statutory surplus for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries decreased $164.5 million during 2011, primarily due to a $99 million ordinary dividend paid to the holding company by Hanover Insurance in April 2011 and from changes in admitted tax assets. This dividend from Hanover Insurance was used to help fund the acquisition of Chaucer. The NAIC prescribes an annual calculation regarding risk based capital ( RBC ). RBC ratios for regulatory purposes, as described in the glossary, are expressed as a percentage of the capital required to be above the Authorized Control Level (the Regulatory Scale ); however, in the insurance industry, RBC ratios are widely expressed as a percentage of the Company Action Level. The following table reflects the Company Action Level, the Authorized Control Level and RBC ratios for Hanover Insurance (which includes Citizens and other U.S. insurance subsidiaries), as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, expressed both on the Industry Scale (Total Adjusted Capital divided by the Company Action Level) and Regulatory Scale (Total Adjusted Capital divided by Authorized Control Level): (dollars in millions) December 31, 2011 Company Action Level Authorized Control Level RBC Ratio Industry Scale RBC Ratio Regulatory Scale The Hanover Insurance Company $ 581.9 $ 291.0 270 % 540 % December 31, 2010 The Hanover Insurance Company $ 566.0 $ 283.0 306 % 613 % -74- Table of Contents LLOYD S CAPITAL REQUIREMENT Chaucer corporate members operate in the Lloyd market, which requires that these members deposit funds, referred to as Funds at Lloyd , to support their underwriting interests. Lloyd sets required capital annually for all participating syndicates based on each syndicates business plans, the rating and reserving environment, and discussions with regulatory and rating agencies. Although the minimum capital levels are set by Lloyd s, it is the responsibility of Chaucer to continually monitor the risk profiles of its managed syndicates to ensure that the level of funding remains appropriate. Such capital is comprised of cash and cash equivalents, investments, undrawn letters of credit provided by various banks and other assets. At December 31, 2011, the required capital supporting our Lloyd business totaled $737.5 million (using the December 31, 2011 GBP to U.S. dollar conversion rate of 1.55). We have securities, assets and letters of credit pledged to Lloyd to satisfy these capital requirements at December 31, 2011 and expect to be able to meet these capital requirements in the future. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity is a measure of our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of business operations. As a holding company, our primary ongoing source of cash is dividends from our insurance subsidiaries. However, dividend payments to us by our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to limitations imposed by regulators, such as prior notice periods and the requirement that dividends in excess of a specified percentage of statutory surplus or prior year statutory earnings receive prior approval (so called extraordinary dividends ). On April 15, 2011, a $99 million ordinary dividend was paid to the holding company by Hanover Insurance. This dividend was used to help fund the acquisition of Chaucer. In 2010 and 2009, dividends of $75.0 million and $153.7 million, respectively, were paid by Hanover, providing cash and securities to the holding company. Dividend payments to the holding company by our Chaucer business are regulated by U.K. law. Dividends from Chaucer are dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries. Annual dividend payments from Chaucer are limited to retained earnings that are not restricted by capital and other requirements for business at Lloyd s. Also, Chaucer must provide advance notice to the U.K. Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) of certain proposed dividends or other payments from FSA regulated entities. There are currently no plans to repatriate dividends to our holding company from Chaucer. Sources of cash for our insurance subsidiaries primarily consist of premiums collected, investment income and maturing investments. Primary cash outflows are paid claims, losses and loss adjustment expenses, policy acquisition expenses, other underwriting expenses and investment purchases. Cash outflows related to losses and loss adjustment expenses can be variable because of uncertainties surrounding settlement dates for liabilities for unpaid losses and because of the potential for large losses either individually or in the aggregate. We periodically adjust our investment policy to respond to changes in short-term and long-term cash requirements. Net cash provided by operating activities was $221.7 million during 2011, compared to net cash provided by operations of $83.6 million in 2010 and $91.6 million in 2009. The $138.1 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily resulted from the absence, in 2011, of a $100.0 million contribution made to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2010, and increased premium collections in 2011, primarily associated with OneBeacon business written in 2010 and our Chaucer business. The $8.0 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily resulted from a $100 million contribution to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in January 2010. In addition, cash was used to provide for higher operating expenses and increased loss and LAE payments in 2010. These cash uses in 2010 were almost entirely offset by cash provided by increased written premium in 2010. Net cash provided by investing activities was $182.8 million during 2011, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $98.8 million in 2010 and $174.2 million in 2009. During 2011, cash provided by investing activities primarily resulted from $756.1 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired from Chaucer. This increase was partially offset by cash paid for the Chaucer acquisition totaling $468.4 million, which included an $11.3 million payment related to a foreign currency exchange forward contract, and the investment of a portion of our Chaucer segment cash into fixed maturities. During 2010, cash used was primarily related to our net purchases of equity securities and fixed maturities. Additionally, cash was used in 2010 in connection with our acquisitions and renewal rights transactions. During 2009, cash was primarily used as we invested a portion of existing cash into fixed maturities and invested the proceeds from the sale of our Life Companies into fixed maturities. Additionally, in 2009, cash was used in connection with the One Beacon renewal rights agreement, which was funded, in part, by the sale of equity securities. This investing activity was partially offset by cash provided from sales of fixed maturities to fund our stock repurchase program. -75- Table of Contents Net cash provided by financing activities was $127.3 million during 2011, compared to cash used in financing activities of $8.6 million in 2010 and $130.2 million in 2009. During 2011, cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from the issuance, on June 17, 2011, of $300.0 million of unsecured senior debentures. Cash received from the issuance of debt was partially offset by the repurchase of $86.8 million of debt, the payment of dividends to our shareholders, repayments of collateral related to our securities lending program, and repurchases of common stock. During 2010, cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from repurchases of common stock and debt, as well as the payment of dividends to our shareholders. These were substantially offset by proceeds from the issuance, on February 23, 2010, of $200.0 million unsecured senior debentures. During 2009, cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from $148.1 million net repurchases of our common stock and $37.5 million to fund annual dividends to shareholders. These uses were partially offset by $53.1 million of cash inflows from our securities lending program. Also during 2009, a $125.0 million advance received as part of the FHLBB collateralized borrowing program was offset by $125.9 million used to repurchase a portion of our corporate debt. At December 31, 2011, THG, as a holding company, held approximately $206 million of fixed maturities and cash. We believe our holding company assets are sufficient to meet our future obligations, which consists primarily of the interest on our senior debentures, our dividends to shareholders (as and to the extent declared), additional funds relating to the purchase of Chaucer, certain costs associated with benefits due to our former life employees and agents, and to the extent required, payments related to indemnification of liabilities associated with the sale of various subsidiaries. We do not expect that it will be necessary to dividend additional funds from our insurance subsidiaries in order to fund 2012 holding company obligations; however, we may decide to do so. Dividends to common shareholders are subject to quarterly board approval and declaration. During 2011, as declared by the Board, we paid three quarterly dividends of $0.275 per share and one quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share to our shareholders. The total dividends paid to our shareholders in 2011 were $50.9 million. We believe that our holding company assets are sufficient to provide for future shareholder dividends should the Board of Directors declare them. We expect to continue to generate sufficient positive operating cash to meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements relating to current operations, including the funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plan and Chaucer pension plan. Based upon the current estimate of liabilities and certain assumptions regarding investment returns and other factors, our qualified defined benefit pension plan is essentially fully funded as of December 31, 2011. As a result, we currently expect that significant cash contributions will not be required for this plan for several years. The Chaucer pension plan is approximately $30 million underfunded as of December 31, 2011. The ultimate payment amounts for both the defined benefit plan and the Chaucer pension plan are based on several assumptions, including but not limited to, the rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate for benefit obligations, mortality experience, interest crediting rates and the ultimate valuation and determination of benefit obligations. Since differences between actual plan experience and our assumptions are likely, changes to our funding obligations in future periods are possible. Our insurance subsidiaries maintain a high degree of liquidity within their respective investment portfolios in fixed maturity and short-term investments. We believe that the quality of the assets we hold will allow us to realize the long-term economic value of our portfolio, including securities that are currently in an unrealized loss position. We do not anticipate the need to sell these securities to meet our insurance subsidiaries cash requirements. We expect our insurance subsidiaries to generate sufficient operating cash to meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements. However, there can be no assurance that unforeseen business needs or other items will not occur causing us to have to sell those securities in a loss position before their values fully recover, thereby causing us to recognize impairment charges in that time period. Since October 2007 and through December 2010, our Board of Directors has authorized aggregate repurchases of our common stock of up to $500 million. Our repurchases may be executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated repurchase programs or other transactions. We are not required to purchase any specific number of shares or to make purchases by any certain date under this program. During 2011, we repurchased 0.6 million shares of our common stock through open market purchases at a cost of $21.7 million. On March 30, 2010 and December 8, 2009, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements with Barclays Bank plc, acting through its agent Barclays Capital, Inc., and utilized a portion of our existing share repurchase -76- Table of Contents authorization for the immediate repurchase of 2.3 million and 2.4 million shares, respectively, of our common stock at a cost of $105.0 million and $105.2 million, respectively. Total repurchases under this program as of December 31, 2011 were 8.6 million shares at a cost of $364.8 million. Over the past several years, we have issued, through two separate transactions, $500 million in senior debentures and have received advances of $163.9 million through our membership in FHLBB as part of a collateralized borrowing program. Additional information related to these borrowings is provided in Note 6 Debt and Credit Arrangements on pages 110 to 111 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Additionally, from time to time, we may also repurchase our debt. In 2011, we repurchased, in several transactions, $69.5 million of Junior Debentures at a cost of $72.1 million, resulting in a net loss of $2.6 million. In addition, we repurchased $4.0 million of surplus notes outstanding related to AIX, $8.0 million of capital securities related to AIX and $3.0 million of capital securities related to Professionals Direct, Inc. These repurchases are expected to reduce our pre-tax interest costs in 2012 by approximately $6 million. In 2010, we repurchased $36.5 million of our Junior Debentures at a cost of $38.5 million, resulting in a $2.0 million loss on the repurchases. In 2009, we repurchased in several transactions, including a tender offer, our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities and Senior Debentures, resulting in a gain of $34.5 million. These mandatorily redeemable securities were originally issued through AFC Capital Trust I, which was liquidated on July 30, 2009. We may decide to repurchase additional debt on an opportunistic basis. On August 2, 2011, we entered into a $200.0 million committed syndicated credit agreement which expires in August 2015, with an option to increase the facility to $250.0 million assuming no default and satisfaction of certain other conditions. The agreement also includes a $50 million sub-facility for standby letters of credit that can be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowings, if any, under this agreement are unsecured and incur interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, a designated base rate or the three month LIBOR plus applicable margin. The agreement provides covenants, including but not limited to, maintaining at least a certain level of consolidated equity, maximum consolidated leverage ratios, and an RBC ratio at our primary U.S. domiciled property and casualty companies. We had no borrowings under this agreement during 2011. At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with these covenants. In 2010, Chaucer entered into a 90.0 million Standby Letter of Credit Facility that is used to provide regulatory capital supporting Chaucer underwriting through two managed syndicates expiring on December 31, 2015, and provides for an annual commitment fee of 1.14 percent. The Standby Facility contains restrictive financial covenants including, but not limited to, maintaining a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and a leverage ratio of less than or equal to 35 percent for Chaucer. In November 2011, we entered into a Standby Letter of Credit Facility Agreement (the Facility Agreement ) not to exceed $180.0 million outstanding at any one time, with the option to increase the amount available for issuances of letters of credit to $270.0 million in the aggregate on one occasion only during the term of the Facility Agreement (subject to the consent of all lenders and assuming no default and satisfaction of other specified conditions). The agreement provides certain covenants including, but not limited to, the syndicates financial condition. The Facility Agreement is used to provide regulatory capital supporting Chaucer underwriting through two managed syndicates. The Facility Agreement expires on December 31, 2016. A letter of credit commission fee on outstanding letters of credit is payable quarterly, and ranges from 1.50% to 2.125% per annum, depending on our credit ratings for portions that are not cash collateralized, and 0.30% per annum for portions that are cash collateralized. A commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments under the Facility Agreement is payable quarterly, and ranges from 0.60% to 0.85% per annum, depending on our credit ratings. Chaucer is also required to pay customary agency fees. We were in compliance with the covenants at December 31, 2011. The Facility Agreement replaces the aforementioned 90.0 million Standby Letter of Credit Facility entered into by Chaucer in 2010. Simultaneous with the Facility Agreement, in November 2011, we entered into a Guaranty Agreement (the Guaranty Agreement ) with Lloyds TSB Bank plc, as Facility Agent and Security Agent, pursuant to which, we unconditionally guarantee the obligations of Chaucer under the Facility Agreement. The Guaranty Agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum net worth, a minimum risk-based capital ratio at our primary U.S. domiciled property and casualty companies and a maximum leverage ratio, and certain negative covenants that limit our ability, among other things, to incur or assume certain debt, grant liens on our property, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, materially change the nature or conduct of our business and make restricted payments (except, in each case, as provided by certain exceptions). The Guaranty Agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties. -77- Table of Contents On June 14, 2010, we purchased approximately 11 acres of developable land in Worcester, Massachusetts for $5 million. A portion of the land will be developed with the construction of a new 200,000 square foot office building and the redevelopment of an adjacent parking garage (the City Square Project ). In addition, we signed a 17 year lease agreement with a tenant for the new building and garage. The tenant is an unaffiliated public company with an investment grade credit rating. Through December 31, 2011, we capitalized an additional $20.7 million in related construction, lease acquisition, legal, architectural and associated costs. Development costs are estimated between $65 million and $70 million and the project will be financed, in part, through the aforementioned issuance of collateralized debt through our membership in the FHLBB. In July 2010, Hanover Insurance committed to borrow $46.3 million from the FHLBB to finance the project. These borrowings will be drawn down in several increments from July 2010 to January 2012. Through December 31, 2011, Hanover Insurance received advances of $38.9 million from this commitment. Amounts drawn from the $46.3 million mature on July 20, 2020 and carry fixed interest rates with a weighted average of 3.88%. On March 31, 2010, we acquired Campania Holding Company, Inc. ( Campania ) for a cash purchase price of approximately $24 million, subject to various terms and conditions. Campania specializes in insurance solutions for portions of the healthcare industry. On December 3, 2009, we entered into a renewal rights agreement with OneBeacon. Through this agreement, we acquired access to a portion of OneBeacon small and middle market commercial business at renewal, including industry programs and middle market niches. This transaction included consideration of approximately $23 million, plus certain potential additional consideration estimated to total approximately $11 million, primarily representing purchased renewal rights intangible assets which are included as other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The agreement was effective for renewals beginning January 1, 2010 Contractual Obligations Our financing obligations generally include repayment of our Senior Debentures, Junior Debentures, subordinated debt, borrowings from the FHLBB, and operating lease payments. The following table represents our annual payments related to the contractual principal and interest payments of these financing obligations as of December 31, 2011 and operating lease payments reflect expected cash payments based upon lease terms. In addition, we also have included our estimated payments related to our loss and LAE obligations and our current expectation of payments to be made to support the obligations of our benefit plans. The following table also includes commitments to purchase investment securities at a future date. Actual payments may differ from the contractual and/or estimated payments in the table. -78- Table of Contents December 31, 2011 Maturity less than 1 year Maturity 1-3 years Maturity 4-5 years Maturity in excess of 5 years Total (in millions) Debt (1) $ $ $ $ 911.1 $ 911.1 Interest associated with debt (1) 60.3 120.6 120.6 431.9 733.4 Operating lease commitments (2) 19.7 31.7 17.5 68.9 Qualified defined benefit pension plan funding obligations (3) Chaucer pension plan funding obligations (3) 2.9 5.8 5.8 8.7 23.2 Non-qualified defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit obligations (4) 8.1 15.2 14.2 30.4 67.9 Investment commitments (5) 81.2 6.8 88.0 Loss and LAE obligations (6) 1,906.8 1,806.6 764.3 1,282.6 5,760.3 (1) Debt includes our senior debentures due in 2025, which pay annual interest at a rate of 7 5/8%, our senior debentures due in 2020, which pay annual interest at a rate of 7.50%, our senior debentures due in 2021, which pay annual interest at a rate of 6.375%, and our junior subordinated debentures due in 2027, which pay cumulative dividends at an annual rate of 8.207%. In addition, we have subordinated notes denominated in Euros due in 2034, which pay interest semi-annually based on the European Inter bank offer rate (Euribor), plus an agreed margin of 3.75%, and subordinated notes due in 2036, which pay interest semi-annually based on the U.S. dollar 3-month LIBOR, plus an agreed margin of 3.1%. Payments related to the principal amounts of these agreements represent contractual maturity; therefore, principal and interest associated with these obligations are reflected in the above table based upon the contractual maturity dates and current Euribor and LIBOR rates of 1.565% and 0.581%, respectively. The Company has the ability to prepay the subordinated notes, which is not reflected in the table above. The Euro denominated debt is converted from Euro to GBP at current rates and then translated to U.S. dollars based upon the December 31, 2011 exchange rate between the GBP and U.S. dollar of 1.55. In addition, we have $125.0 million of borrowings under a collateralized borrowing program with the FHLBB which pays interest monthly at a rate of 5.50% annually. Such borrowings are available for a twenty-year term or through September 25, 2029. We also have $38.9 million of borrowings under this collateralized borrowing program which pays interest monthly. Furthermore, we borrowed an additional $7.4 million under this program in January 2012. All borrowings under this program with the FHLBB pay interest at a weighted average rate of 3.88%. These borrowings have a maturity date of July 20, 2020. (2) Our U.S. and international subsidiaries are lessees with a number of operating leases. (3) In 2010, we contributed $100.0 million to our qualified defined benefit pension plan and do not expect to make any significant additional contributions in order to meet our minimum funding requirements. However, additional contributions may be required in the future based on the level of pension assets and liabilities in future periods. Chaucer pension plan funding obligations reflect estimated payments to be made through plan year 2019 based on a payment schedule determined by the plan trustees. Additional contributions may be required for unfunded benefit obligations, if any, after plan year 2019 as determined by the plan trustees. For purposes of this table, we used the foreign currency exchange rate of 1.55 at December 31, 2011 to determine the future cash payments. The ultimate payment amount for these pension plans are based on several assumptions, including, but not limited to, the rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate for benefit obligations, mortality experience, interest crediting rates and the ultimate valuation of benefit obligations. Differences between actual plan experience and our assumptions are likely and will likely result in changes to our funding obligations in future periods. (4) Non-qualified defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations reflect estimated payments to be made through plan year 2021 for pension, postretirement and postemployment benefits. Estimates of these payments and the payment patterns are based upon historical experience. (5) Investment commitments include $46.8 million related to the City Square Project, $23.6 million related to tax credits, and $17.6 million related to partnerships and other investment commitments. (6) Unlike many other forms of contractual obligations, loss and LAE reserves do not have definitive due dates and the ultimate payment dates are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties. As a result, the total loss and LAE reserve payments to be made by period, as shown in the table, are estimates based principally on historical experience. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We currently do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial position, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS Information regarding litigation and legal contingencies appears in Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies on pages 127 to 128 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Information related to certain regulatory and industry developments are contained in Regulation in Item 1 Business included on pages 12 to 14 of this Form 10-K and in Item 1A Risk Factors on pages 22 to 37 of this Form 10-K. RATING AGENCIES Insurance companies are rated by rating agencies to provide both industry participants and insurance consumers information on specific insurance companies. Higher ratings generally indicate the rating agencies opinion regarding financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims. We believe that strong ratings are important factors in marketing our products to our agents and customers, since rating information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. Insurance company financial strength ratings are assigned to an insurer based upon factors deemed by the rating agencies to be relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors. Such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy, hold or sell any security. Customers typically focus on claims-paying ratings, while creditors focus on debt ratings. Investors use both to evaluate a company overall financial strength. -79- Table of Contents RISKS AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Management Discussion and Analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of indicators of forward-looking statements and specific important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, see Part I Item 1A on pages 22 to 37 of this Annual Report of Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011. This Management Discussion and Analysis should be read and interpreted in light of such factors. GLOSSARY OF SELECTED INSURANCE TERMS Account rounding The conversion of single policy customers to accounts with multiple policies and/or additional coverages. Benefit payments Payments made to an insured or their beneficiary in accordance with the terms of an insurance policy. Capacity The maximum amount of business which may be accepted by a syndicate or a corporate member on a syndicate, expressed in terms of gross premium written, net of commission. Casualty insurance Insurance that is primarily concerned with the losses caused by injuries to third persons and their property (other than the policyholder) and the related legal liability of the insured for such losses. Catastrophe A severe loss, resulting from natural and manmade events, including risks such as hurricane, fire, earthquake, windstorm, tornado, hailstorm, severe winter weather, explosion, terrorism, riots and other similar events. Catastrophe loss Loss and directly identified loss adjustment expenses from catastrophes. The Insurance Services Office ( ISO ) Property Claim Services ( PCS ) defines a catastrophe loss as an event that causes $25 million or more in U.S. industry insured property losses and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers. In addition to those catastrophe events declared by ISO, claims management also generally includes within the definition of a catastrophe loss , a property loss event that causes approximately $5 million or more in company insured losses and affects in excess of one hundred policyholders or multiple independent risks. For the international business in our Chaucer segment, management utilizes a catastrophe loss definition that is substantially consistent with the ISO definition framework. Cede; cedent; ceding company When a party reinsures its liability with another, it cedes business and is referred to as the cedent or ceding company . Combined ratio, GAAP This ratio is the GAAP equivalent of the statutory ratio that is widely used as a benchmark for determining an insurer underwriting performance. A ratio below 100% generally indicates profitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income. A combined ratio over 100% generally indicates unprofitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio, the loss adjustment expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio. Corporate member A company admitted to membership of Lloyd and which provides capital in support of a Lloyd syndicate to enable the syndicate to undertake underwriting risks. Credit spread The difference between the yield on the debt securities of a particular corporate debt issue and the yield of a similar maturity of U.S. Treasury debt securities. Current accident year loss results A non-GAAP measure of the estimated earnings impact of current premiums offset by estimated loss experience and expenses for the current accident year. This measure includes the estimated increase in revenue associated with higher prices (premiums), including those caused by price inflation and changes in exposure, partially offset by higher volume driven expenses and inflation of loss costs. Volume driven expenses include policy acquisition costs such as commissions paid to property and casualty agents, which are typically based on a percentage of premium dollars. Dividends received deduction A corporation is entitled to a special tax deduction from gross income for dividends received from a domestic corporation that is subject to income tax. Earned premium The portion of a premium that is recognized as income, or earned, based on the expired portion of the policy period, that is, the period for which loss coverage has actually been provided. For example, after six months, $50 of a $100 annual premium is generally considered earned premium. The remaining $50 of annual premium is unearned premium. Net earned premium is earned premium net of reinsurance. Economic interest The share of syndicate underwriting capacity supported by capital from Chaucer Holdings plc. Excess of loss reinsurance Reinsurance that indemnifies the insured against all or a specific portion of losses under reinsured policies in excess of a specified dollar amount or retention . Expense Ratio, GAAP The ratio of underwriting expenses to premiums earned for a given period. -80- Table of Contents Exposure As it relates to underwriting, a measure of the rating units or premium basis of a risk; for example, an exposure of a number of automobiles. As it relates to loss events, the maximum value of claims made on an insurer from an event or events that would result in the total exhaustion of the cover or indemnity offered by an insurance policy. Frequency The number of claims occurring during a given coverage period. Funds at Lloyd Funds held in trust at Lloyd as security for the policyholders and to support a corporate member overall underwriting activities. The funds must be in a form approved by Lloyd and be maintained at certain specified levels. Inland Marine Insurance In Commercial Lines, this is a type of coverage developed for shipments that do not involve ocean transport. It covers articles in transit by all forms of land and air transportation as well as bridges, tunnels and other means of transportation and communication. In the context of Personal Lines, this term relates to floater policies that cover expensive personal items such as fine art and jewelry. Loss adjustment expenses ( LAE ) Expenses incurred in the adjusting, recording, and settlement of claims. These expenses include both internal company expenses and outside services. Examples of LAE include claims adjustment services, adjuster salaries and fringe benefits, legal fees and court costs, investigation fees and claims processing fees. Loss adjustment expense ( LAE ) ratio, GAAP The ratio of loss adjustment expenses to earned premiums for a given period. Loss costs An amount of money paid for a property and casualty claim. Loss ratio, GAAP The ratio of losses to premiums earned for a given period. Loss reserves Liabilities established by insurers to reflect the estimated cost of claims payments and the related expenses that the insurer will ultimately be required to pay in respect of insurance it has written. Reserves are established for losses and for LAE. Managing agent An agent that runs the affairs of a syndicate. Multivariate product An insurance product, the pricing for which is based upon the magnitude of, and correlation between, multiple rating factors. In practical application, the term refers to the foundational analytics and methods applied to the product construct. Our Connections Auto product is an example of a multivariate product. Peril A cause of loss. Property insurance Insurance that provides coverage for tangible property in the event of loss, damage or loss of use. Rate The pricing factor upon which the policyholder premium is based. Rate increase (Commercial Lines and Chaucer) Represents the average change in premium on renewal policies caused by the estimated net effect of base rate changes, discretionary pricing, inflation or changes in policy level exposure. Rate increase (Personal Lines) The estimated cumulative premium effect of approved rate actions during the prior policy period applied to a policy renewal premium. Reinstatement premium A pro-rata reinsurance premium that may be charged for reinstating the amount of reinsurance coverage reduced as the result of a reinsurance loss payment under a reinsurance treaty. For events that we are the insured party, the charge would decrease premiums; for events where we provide reinsurance coverage, the charge would increase premiums. For example, in 2005, this premium was required to ensure that our property catastrophe occurrence treaty, which was exhausted by Hurricane Katrina, was available again in the event of another large catastrophe loss in 2005. Reinsurance An arrangement in which an insurance company, or a reinsurance company, known as the reinsurer, agrees to indemnify another insurance or reinsurance company, known as the ceding company, against all or a portion of the insurance or reinsurance risks underwritten by the ceding company under one or more policies. Reinsurance can provide a ceding company with several benefits, including a reduction in net liability on risks and catastrophe protection from large or multiple losses. Reinsurance does not legally discharge the primary insurer from its liability with respect to its obligations to the insured. Risk based capital ( RBC ) A method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The RBC ratio for regulatory purposes is calculated as total adjusted capital divided by required risk based capital. Total adjusted capital for property and casualty companies is capital and surplus, adjusted for the non-tabular reserve discount applicable to our assumed discontinued accident and health insurance business. The Company Action Level is the first level at which regulatory involvement is specified based upon the level of capital. -81- Table of Contents Regulators may take action for reasons other than triggering various RBC action levels. The various action levels are summarized as follows: The Company Action Level, which equals 200% of the Authorized Control Level, requires a company to prepare and submit a RBC plan to the commissioner of the state of domicile. A RBC plan proposes actions which a company may take in order to bring statutory capital above the Company Action Level. After review, the commissioner will notify the company if the plan is satisfactory. The Regulatory Action Level, which equals 150% of the Authorized Control Level, requires the insurer to submit to the commissioner of the state of domicile an RBC plan, or if applicable, a revised RBC plan. After examination or analysis, the commissioner will issue an order specifying corrective actions to be taken. The Authorized Control Level authorizes the commissioner of the state of domicile to take whatever regulatory actions considered necessary to protect the best interest of the policyholders and creditors of the insurer. The Mandatory Control Level, which equals 70% of the Authorized Control Level, authorizes the commissioner of the state of domicile to take actions necessary to place the company under regulatory control (i.e., rehabilitation or liquidation). Security Lending We engage our banking provider to lend securities from our investment portfolio to third parties. These lent securities are fully collateralized by cash. We monitor the fair value of the securities on a daily basis to assure that the collateral is maintained at a level of at least 102% of the fair value of the loaned securities. We record securities lending collateral as a cash equivalent, with an offsetting liability in expenses and taxes payable. Severity A monetary increase in the loss costs associated with the same or similar type of event or coverage. Solvency II European Commission-led fundamental review of the capital adequacy regime for the European insurance industry. Specialty Lines A major component of our other commercial lines. There is no accepted industry definition of specialty lines , but for our purpose specialty lines consist of products such as inland and ocean marine, bond business, specialty property, professional liability, management liability and various other program businesses. When discussing net written premiums and other financial measures of our specialty businesses, we may include non-specialty premiums that are written as part of the entire account. Statutory accounting principles Recording transactions and preparing financial statements in accordance with the rules and procedures prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities including the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ), which in general reflect a liquidating, rather than going concern, concept of accounting. Supranational An international organization, or union, whereby member states transcend national boundaries or interests to share in the decision-making and vote on issues pertaining to the wider grouping. European Investment Bank is an example of a supranational. Syndicate A group of members underwriting insurance at Lloyd through the agency of a managing agent, to whom a particular syndicate number is assigned. Underwriting The process of selecting risks for insurance and determining in what amounts and on what terms the insurance company will accept risks. Underwriting expenses Expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition, pricing and administration of a policy. Underwriting expense ratio, GAAP The ratio of underwriting expenses to earned premiums in a given period. Unearned premiums The portion of a premium representing the unexpired amount of the contract term as of a certain date. Written premium The premium assessed for the entire coverage period of a property and casualty policy without regard to how much of the premium has been earned. See also earned premium. Net written premium is written premium net of reinsurance.
