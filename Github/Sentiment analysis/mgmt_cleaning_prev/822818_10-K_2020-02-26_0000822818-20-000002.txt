ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are North America leading provider of environmental, energy and industrial services supporting our customers in finding environmentally responsible solutions to further their sustainability goals in today's world. We believe we operate, in the aggregate, the largest number of hazardous waste incinerators, landfills and treatment, storage and disposal facilities ("TSDFs") in North America. We serve a diverse customer base, including Fortune 500 companies, across the chemical, energy, manufacturing and additional markets, as well as numerous government agencies. These customers rely on us to deliver a broad range of services including but not limited to end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency response, industrial cleaning and maintenance and recycling services. We are also the largest re-refiner and recycler of used oil in North America and the largest provider of parts cleaning and related environmental services to commercial, industrial and automotive customers in North America. We have two operating segments ; (i) the Environmental Services segment and (ii) the Safety-Kleen segment. Performance of our segments is evaluated on several factors of which the primary financial measure is Adjusted EBITDA as described more fully below. The following is a discussion of how management evaluates its segments including key performance indicators that management uses to assess the segments results, as well as certain macroeconomic trends and influences that impact each reportable segment: Environmental Services - Environmental Services segment results are predicated upon the demand by our customers for waste services directly attributable to waste volumes generated by them and project work for which waste handling and/or disposal is required. In managing the business and evaluating performance, management tracks the volumes and mix of waste handled and disposed of through our owned incinerators and landfills, as well as utilization of such incinerators, labor and billable hours and equipment among other key metrics. Levels of activity and ultimate performance associated with this segment can be impacted by several factors including overall U.S. GDP and U.S. industrial production, weather conditions, efficiency of our operations, technology, changing regulations, competition, market pricing of our services and the management of our related operating costs. Environmental Services results are also impacted by the demand for planned and unplanned industrial related cleaning and maintenance services at customer sites and for environmental cleanup services on a scheduled or emergency basis, including response to national events such as major chemical spills, natural disasters or other events where immediate and specialized services are required. Safety-Kleen - Safety-Kleen segment results are impacted by an array of core service and product offerings that serve to attract small quantity waste producers as customers and integrate them into the Clean Harbors waste network. Core service offerings include parts washer services, containerized waste services, vac services, used motor oil collection and contract blending and packaging services. Key performance indicators tracked by the Company relative to these services include the number of parts washer services performed and pricing and volume of used motor oil and waste collected. Results from these services are primarily driven by the overall number of parts washers placed at customer sites and volumes of waste collected, as well as the demand for and frequency of other offered services. These factors can be impacted by overall economic conditions in the marketplace, especially in the automotive related area. In addition to its core service offerings, Safety-Kleen offers high quality recycled base and blended oil products to end users including fleet customers, distributors and manufacturers of oil products. Other product offerings include automotive related fluids and shop supplies. Relative to its oil related products, management tracks the Company's volumes and relative percentages of base and blended oil sales along with various pricing metrics associated with the commodity driven marketplace. The segment results are significantly impacted by overall market pricing and product mix associated with base and blended oil products and, more specifically, the market prices of Group II base oils. Costs incurred in connection with the collection of used oil and other raw materials associated with the segment oil related products can also be volatile. Our OilPlus closed loop initiative, which results in the sale of our renewable oil products directly to our end customers, may also be impacted by changes in customer demand for high-quality, environmentally responsible recycled oil. Highlights Total revenues for 2019 increased 3.4% to $3.4 billion , compared with $3.3 billion in 2018 . Our Environmental Services segment increased direct revenues $95.9 million in 2019 compared with 2018 due to greater activity at our sales and service branches and improvements in average pricing which was driven by a more profitable mix of waste streams across our incinerator network. Direct revenues recorded by Safety-Kleen increased $16.8 million in 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of continued growth across Safety-Kleen core service offerings and higher volumes of blended oil sales. Foreign currency 28 Table Of Contents translation of our Canadian operations negatively impacted our consolidated direct revenues by $12.9 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 . Income from operations in 2019 was $229.5 million , compared with $182.6 million in 2018 . We reported net income in 2019 and 2018 of $97.7 million and $65.6 million , respectively. Adjusted EBITDA, which is the primary financial measure by which our segments are evaluated, increased 10.0% to $540.3 million in 2019 from $491.0 million in 2018 . The increased level of Adjusted EBITDA in 2019 was primarily attributable to higher revenue amounts as described above and improved operating margins. Additional information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, including a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, appears below under "Adjusted EBITDA." Net cash from operating activities for 2019 was $413.2 million , an increase of $40.0 million from 2018 . Adjusted free cash flow, which management uses to measure our financial strength and ability to generate cash, was $208.5 million in 2019 , which represented a $13.2 million increase over 2018 primarily due to greater levels of operating income and lower levels of working capital, which was due in part to a change in timing of interest payments associated with the debt refinancing completed in the third quarter of 2019. These increases were partially offset by increased capital and environmental spending. Additional information regarding adjusted free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure, including a reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow to net cash from operating activities, appears below under " Adjusted Free Cash Flow ." 29 Table Of Contents Segment Performance The primary financial measure by which we evaluate the performance of our segments is Adjusted EBITDA. The following table sets forth certain financial information associated with our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except percentages).

(2) Cost of revenue is shown exclusive of items presented separately on the consolidated statements of operations, which consist of (i) accretion of environmental liabilities and (ii) depreciation and amortization. Direct Revenues There are many factors which have impacted and continue to impact our revenues. These factors include, but are not limited to: overall industrial activity and growth in North America, existence or non-existence of large scale environmental waste and remediation projects, competitive industry pricing, impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, the level of emergency response projects, base and blended oil pricing, market changes relative to the collection of used oil, the number of parts washers placed at customer sites and foreign currency translation. In addition, customer efforts to minimalize hazardous waste and changes in regulation can also impact our revenues. Environmental Services For the years ended December 31, 2019 over 2018 2018 over 2017 (in thousands, except percentages) 2019 2018 2017 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Direct revenues $ 2,237,068 $ 2,141,194 $ 1,857,474 $ 95,874 4.5 % $ 283,720 15.3 % Environmental Services direct revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $95.9 million from the comparable period in 2018 . Greater levels of activity at our sales and service branches and improved average pricing for 30 Table Of Contents disposal of waste streams at our incinerators drove this increase in 2019 . Service related revenues increased, in part, due to $15.1 million of emergency response work associated with Field and Emergency Response revenue streams during 2019, compared to $9.8 million during 2018. Despite a higher number of down days at our Deer Park facility in Q1 2019 as a result of a fire at a neighboring facility, utilization at our incinerator facilities in 2019 remained relatively consistent with the prior year at approximately 85%. A mix of higher priced waste streams resulted in an increase in direct revenues from our incinerator facilities year over year. Average price per ton increased approximately 11% from the prior year for a $35.1 million increase in direct revenues in 2019. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Industrial Services revenue as we continue to focus on selecting higher margin turnaround projects. Also impacting the year over year change in direct revenues within this segment was the negative impact of foreign currency translation on our Canadian operations of $9.3 million. Environmental Services direct revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $283.7 million from the comparable period in 2017 . Included in the current year revenues was $154.0 million of direct revenues from the Veolia Business, which we acquired on February 23, 2018. Excluding the impacts from the Veolia Business, Environmental Services direct revenues increased $129.5 million primarily due to greater levels of activity at our sales and service branches and increased levels of disposal related revenues from improved pricing conditions and mix associated with waste streams at our incinerators in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018 , landfill volumes increased slightly as compared to 2017 . The utilization rate at our incinerators was 86.7% on a practical capacity of 561,721 tons for the year ended December 31, 2018 , compared with 87.6% on a practical capacity of 561,721 tons in 2017 . The decrease in utilization rates in 2018 was impacted by a slightly higher number of down days at our facilities during 2018 ; however, impacts on the profitability of the business from an increase in down days was more than offset by improved pricing conditions and an increase in volumes of higher margin waste streams received in 2018 . The impact of foreign currency translation on our Canadian operations within the Environmental Services segment was minimal in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017 . Safety-Kleen For the years ended December 31, 2019 over 2018 2018 over 2017 (in thousands, except percentages) 2019 2018 2017 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Direct revenues $ 1,178,129 $ 1,161,282 $ 1,087,886 $ 16,847 1.5 % $ 73,396 6.7 % Safety-Kleen direct revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $16.8 million from the comparable period in 2018 primarily due to growth in the business core service offerings and increased blended oil volumes. Revenues generated through our core service offerings, such as handling of containerized waste and vacuum services, accounted for $22.3 million of incremental revenues driven both by volume and pricing increases. Higher volumes of blended oil sales and increased pricing of our used motor oil collections contributed $15.6 million and $5.2 million, respectively, to the growth in direct revenues from the comparable period in 2018 . Revenue from contract blending and packaging also increased $9.3 million due to increased volume. These increases were partially offset by a $17.5 million decrease in base oil sales due to reductions in pricing experienced in 2019 in response to lower demand across the base oil market and lower base oil volumes, most significantly seen in the first quarter of 2019 . Sales of recycled fuel oil and refinery bi-products decreased by $12.3 million from prior year due to a reduction in volume. In 2019 , parts washer services were relatively consistent with the prior year. Also included in the change within this segment was the negative impact of foreign currency translation on our Canadian operations of $3.4 million. Safety-Kleen direct revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $73.4 million from the comparable period in 2017 primarily due to more favorable pricing on oil products and growth in the business core service offerings. Revenues generated through our core service offerings such as handling of containerized waste and vac services, parts washer services as well as sales of automotive and industrial cleaning products accounted for $21.3 million of incremental revenues. Increased base and blended volumes and oil pricing accounted for $34.7 million of incremental direct revenues from the comparable period in 2017. Sales of contract packaging and blending services, refinery bi-products and recycled fuel oil also increased by $38.9 million from the comparable period in 2017 . These increases were partially offset by a decrease in used motor oil collection revenues of $19.5 million as market pricing for these services was negatively impacted as crude oil prices generally rose throughout the earlier parts of 2018 . The impact of foreign currency translation on our Canadian operations within the Safety-Kleen segment was minimal in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017 . Cost of Revenues We believe that our ability to manage operating costs is important to our ability to remain price competitive. We continue to upgrade the quality and efficiency of our services through the development of new technology and continued modifications at our facilities, invest in new business opportunities and aggressively implement strategic sourcing and logistics solutions as well as other cost reduction initiatives while also continuing to optimize our management and operating structure in an effort to 31 Table Of Contents maintain and increase operating margins. These strategic cost saving actions help to reduce the impacts of naturally rising costs such as labor and other core operating costs across our businesses. Environmental Services For the years ended December 31, 2019 over 2018 2018 over 2017 (in thousands, except percentages) 2019 2018 2017 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Cost of revenues $ 1,620,038 $1,576,705 $1,373,789 $ 43,333 2.7 % $ 202,916 14.8 % As a % of Direct revenues 72.4 % 73.6 % 74.0 % (1.2 )% (0.4 )% Environmental Services cost of revenues increased $43.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 , however these costs decreased as a percentage of direct revenue due to a mix of higher priced waste streams in our incineration network, which increased profitability, and the results of ongoing cost reduction projects, including site consolidations. The overall cost increase was due to compensation and benefits related costs, equipment and supply costs and transportation, outside disposal and fuel costs which increased $20.4 million, $11.4 million and $3.9 million, respectively. The incremental operating costs were commensurate with greater activity levels in 2019. Environmental Services cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $202.9 million from the comparable period in 2017 . The acquired Veolia Business had cost of revenues of $131.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 . Excluding these costs, Environmental Services cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $71.7 million, however these costs as a percentage of direct revenues decreased slightly over the comparable period of 2017, due to a more favorable mix of waste streams in our incineration network which increased profitability. The overall cost increase was due to labor and benefit related costs, transportation, disposal and fuel costs, and equipment, supply and various other expenses of $45.4 million, $16.2 million and $10.0 million, respectively. The incremental operating costs were commensurate with greater activity levels in 2018 and overall inflationary pressure across several cost categories including certain commodity supplies such as fuel and other supplies. Safety-Kleen For the years ended December 31, 2019 over 2018 2018 over 2017 (in thousands, except percentages) 2019 2018 2017 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Cost of revenues $ 749,407 $ 725,734 $ 690,344 $ 23,673 3.3 % $ 35,390 5.1 % As a % of Direct revenues 63.6 % 62.5 % 63.5 % 1.1 % (1.0 )% Safety-Kleen cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $23.7 million from the comparable period in 2018 . As a percentage of direct revenues, these costs increased as well mainly due to lower average pricing on the oil products sold leading to reduced leverage of our fixed cost base. Increased logistics costs, largely due to weather at the beginning of the year, also negatively impacted costs as a percentage of direct revenues. The overall cost increase was due to higher compensation and benefits related costs of $8.5 million, raw material costs associated with blended oil products of $5.5 million and transportation, disposal and fuel costs of $2.7 million. These increases were in line with the overall growth of our core service offerings and blended oil sales. Safety-Kleen cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $35.4 million from the comparable period in 2017 , however these costs decreased as a percentage of revenue due to our effective management of the spread between used oil input costs and base oil pricing, as well as the implementation of new pricing strategies, which generated greater levels of direct revenue. The overall cost increase was primarily due to increased costs of raw materials associated with oil products of $15.8 million, increased transportation, disposal and fuel costs of $12.3 million and labor related costs of $6.3 million. These increases were in line with the overall growth of the business and increased costs of commodities. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses We strive to manage our selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses commensurate with the overall performance of our segments and corresponding revenue levels. We believe that our ability to properly align these costs with business performance is reflective of our strong management of the businesses and further promotes our ability to remain competitive in the marketplace. 32 Table Of Contents Environmental Services For the years ended December 31, 2019 over 2018 2018 over 2017 (in thousands, except percentages) 2019 2018 2017 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change SG&A expenses $ 170,746 $ 183,633 $ 162,375 $ (12,887 ) (7.0 )% $ 21,258 13.1 % As a % of Direct revenues 7.6 % 8.6 % 8.7 % (1.0 )% (0.1 )% Environmental Services SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $12.9 million from the comparable period in 2018 and SG&A as a percentage of direct revenue decreased as well. The primary driver of these decreases relates to certain trade receivables which were reserved for in 2018 and subsequently recovered in 2019, generating a favorable difference of nearly $13.0 million. The favorable resolution of a litigation matter further reduced SG&A expenses by $5.5 million in 2019. These decreases were partially offset by a $5.2 million increase in compensation and benefits related costs which was consistent with the growth of the business in 2019. Excluding the recovery of trade receivables and litigation impacts, 2019 SG&A expenses as a percentage of direct revenues still improved over the prior year. Environmental Services SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $21.3 million from the comparable period in 2017 , however as a percentage of direct revenues, these costs remained consistent between the two periods. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to increases in salary, benefits and variable compensation related costs of $14.7 million and bad debt expense of $7.0 million, partially offset by cost reductions across various expense categories. The increases in salary, benefits and variable compensation are in line with the growth of the business in 2018 as compared to 2017 . Safety-Kleen For the years ended December 31, 2019 over 2018 2018 over 2017 (in thousands, except percentages) 2019 2018 2017 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change SG&A expenses $ 146,344 $ 153,519 $ 147,731 $ (7,175 ) (4.7 )% $ 5,788 3.9 % As a % of Direct revenues 12.4 % 13.2 % 13.6 % (0.8 )% (0.4 )% Safety-Kleen SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $7.2 million from the comparable period in 2018 and SG&A as a percentage of direct revenues decreased as well. The primary driver of these decreases is a $4.4 million decrease in compensation and benefits related costs resulting from lower headcount and cost saving initiatives implemented by the business throughout 2019. A reduction in legal related costs of $1.6 million also contributed to the overall decrease in SG&A expenses. Safety-Kleen SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $5.8 million from the comparable period in 2017 , however these costs decreased as a percentage of direct revenues, as the additional direct revenues outpaced incremental SG&A expenses. The overall increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to increased salaries, benefits and variable compensation of $5.7 million as we continue to grow the business. Corporate Items For the years ended December 31, 2019 over 2018 2018 over 2017 (in thousands, except percentages) 2019 2018 2017 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change SG&A expenses $ 166,964 $ 166,595 $ 146,542 $ 369 0.2 % $ 20,053 13.7 % Corporate Items SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were consistent with the comparable period in 2018 . Continued investment in our employees increased our compensation and benefits related costs by $6.6 million and stock-based compensation increased by $1.0 million due to the achievement of certain performance metrics associated with performance based awards. These costs were offset by a $6.9 million reduction in legal and consulting fees due to cost saving initiatives. Corporate Items SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $20.1 million from the comparable period in 2017 primarily due to increased salaries and benefits resulting from continued commitments to investing in our employees and variable compensation totaling $14.8 million, as well as increased stock-based compensation of $4.3 million primarily attributable to the achievement of performance metrics associated with performance based awards in 2018 . Incremental costs associated with the acquired Veolia Business also contributed to the increased costs. 33 Table Of Contents Adjusted EBITDA Management considers Adjusted EBITDA to be a measurement of performance which provides useful information to both management and investors. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income or other measurements under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies and, therefore our measurements of Adjusted EBITDA, while defined consistently and in accordance with our existing credit agreement, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We use Adjusted EBITDA to enhance our understanding of our operating performance, which represents our views concerning our performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of our operations. We historically have found it helpful, and believe that investors have found it helpful, to consider an operating measure that excludes certain expenses relating to transactions not reflective of our core operations. The information about our operating performance provided by this financial measure is used by our management for a variety of purposes. We regularly communicate Adjusted EBITDA results to our lenders since our loan covenants are based upon levels of Adjusted EBITDA achieved and to our board of directors and we discuss with the board our interpretation of such results. We also compare our Adjusted EBITDA performance against internal targets as a key factor in determining cash and equity bonus compensation for executives and other employees, largely because we believe that this measure is indicative of how the fundamental business is performing and is being managed. We also provide information relating to our Adjusted EBITDA so that analysts, investors and other interested persons have the same data that we use to assess our core operating performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed only as a supplement to the GAAP financial information. We also believe, however, that providing this information in addition to, and together with, GAAP financial information provides a better understanding of our core operating performance and how management evaluates and measures our performance.

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $10.2 million from the comparable period in 2017 , primarily due to incremental depreciation from acquisitions and a slight increase in volumes at our landfills that drove higher landfill amortization. 34 Table Of Contents Other Income (Expense), net For the years ended December 31, 2019 over 2018 2018 over 2017 (in thousands, except percentages) 2019 2018 2017 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Other income (expense), net $ 2,897 $ (4,510 ) $ (6,119 ) $ 7,407 (164.2 )% $ 1,609 (26.3 )% For the year ended December 31, 2019 , other income (expense), net increased $7.4 million from the comparable period in 2018 primarily due to insurance proceeds received in 2019 and smaller comparative losses recognized on sales or disposals of fixed assets. Other income (expense), net increased $1.6 million from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to smaller losses recognized on sales or disposals of fixed assets in 2018 .

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $7.9 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in connection with the extinguishment of $400.0 million of the previously outstanding senior unsecured notes. The losses recognized in each of these years consisted of amounts paid in excess of par in order to extinguish the debt prior to maturity and non-cash expenses related to the write-off of unamortized financing costs. For additional information regarding our financing arrangements, see Note 12, "Financing Arrangements," under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this report. Gain on Sale of Businesses For the years ended December 31, 2019 over 2018 2018 over 2017 (in thousands, except percentages) 2019 2018 2017 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Gain on sale of businesses $ 687 $ $ 30,732 $ 687 N/M $ (30,732 ) N/M During the year ended December 31, 2019 , we recorded a $0.7 million gain on the sale of a non-core business within our Environmental Services segment. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $30.7 million gain on the sale of our Transformer Services business which had been part of our Environmental Services segment. For additional information regarding these gains on sale of businesses, see Note 5, "Disposition of Businesses," under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this report. Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes For the years ended December 31, 2019 over 2018 2018 over 2017 (in thousands, except percentages) 2019 2018 2017 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 50,499 $ 28,846 $ (42,050 ) $ 21,653 75.1 % $ 70,896 (168.6)% For the year ended December 31, 2019, provision for income taxes increased $21.7 million from the comparable period in 2018 due to higher earnings in the United States and the impact from a nonrecurring $9.8 million benefit recognized in 2018 related to the filing of then current and amended prior year tax returns in that year. The effective tax rate for 2019 was 34.1% as compared to 30.5% in the prior year. The income tax benefit in 2017 was primarily driven by impacts from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") signed into law in December 2017. Impacts of the Tax Act resulted in a net benefit of $93.0 million being recorded in 2017. Excluding the impacts of the Tax Act, a provision of $51.0 million would have been recognized. 35 Table Of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources For the years ended December 31, (in thousands) 2019 2018 2017 Net cash from operating activities $ 413,192 $ 373,210 $ 285,698 Net cash used in investing activities (217,856 ) (349,659 ) (203,267 ) Net cash used in financing activities (53,425 ) (110,997 ) (72,760 ) Net cash from operating activities Net cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $413.2 million , an increase of $40.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 . The increase was most directly attributable to greater levels of operating income and lower working capital, partially offset by an increase in environmental spending. The reduction in working capital was primarily attributable to the timing of interest payments associated with the debt refinancing completed in the third quarter of 2019. Refinancing this debt changed the timing of our related interest payments from June and December to January and July. Net cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $373.2 million , an increase of $87.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 . The increase was most directly attributable to greater levels of operating income, lower interest payments and a reduction in environmental expenditures, which was offset by higher working capital levels due to overall growth in our business. Net cash used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $217.9 million , a decrease of $131.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 . This decrease was due to less cash used to fund acquisitions in 2019 and an increase in net proceeds from sales of marketable securities, partially offset by $26.8 million of increased capital expenditure levels, net of proceeds, primarily due to 2019 investments in facility upgrades and landfill spending. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $349.7 million , an increase of $146.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 . The change was primarily driven by the 2018 use of cash to fund acquisitions, increased capital expenditure levels net of proceeds primarily related to sales of manufacturing assets in Western Canada, a reduction in net purchases of marketable securities and the lack in 2018 of proceeds from sale of a business, which occurred in 2017 with the Transformer Services divestiture. Net cash used in financing activities Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $53.4 million , a decrease of $57.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 . The decrease was primarily driven by a $50.0 million reduction in net principal payments on debt obligations in 2019 and a $23.7 million decrease in repurchases of common stock, partially offset by increased outflows for deferred financing costs associated with debt refinancing activities in 2019 of $6.1 million, tax payments related to withholdings on vested restricted stock of $4.2 million and changes in uncashed checks of $3.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $111.0 million , an increase of $38.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 . The primary reason for the increase in 2018 was the increase in funds used for the net pay down of debt obligations totaling $55.8 million which occurred during the year. Offsetting this increase was decreased outflows related to stock repurchases of $3.9 million, premiums paid on the extinguishment of debt of $4.8 million, and changes in uncashed checks of $5.8 million. Adjusted Free Cash Flow Management considers adjusted free cash flow to be a measure of liquidity which provides useful information to both management, creditors and investors about our financial strength and our ability to generate cash. Additionally, adjusted free cash flow is a metric on which a portion of management incentive compensation is based. We define adjusted free cash flow as net cash from operating activities excluding cash impacts of items derived from non-operating activities, such as taxes paid in connection with divestitures, less additions to property, plant and equipment plus proceeds from sales or disposals of fixed assets. Adjusted free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net cash from operating activities or other measurements under GAAP. Adjusted free cash flow is not calculated identically by all companies, and therefore our measurements of adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 36 Table Of Contents The following is a reconciliation from net cash from operating activities to adjusted free cash flow for the following periods (in thousands): For the years ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Net cash from operating activities $ 413,192 $ 373,210 $ 285,698 Additions to property, plant and equipment (216,324 ) (193,344 ) (167,007 ) Proceeds from sale and disposal of fixed assets 11,655 15,445 7,124 Tax liability on sale of business 14,423 Adjusted free cash flow $ 208,523 $ 195,311 $ 140,238 Summary of Capital Resources At December 31, 2019 , cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $414.4 million , compared to $279.4 million at December 31, 2018 . At December 31, 2019 , cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries totaled $74.5 million and were readily convertible into other currencies including U.S. Dollars. At December 31, 2019 , the cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balance for our U.S. operations was $339.9 million , and our U.S. operations had net operating cash flows of $392.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 . Additionally, we have a $400.0 million revolving credit facility, of which approximately $229.2 million was available to borrow at December 31, 2019 . Based on the above and our current plans, we believe that our operations have adequate financial resources to satisfy their current liquidity needs. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to fund operations, capital expenditures, interest payments and investments in line with our business strategy. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and internal investing cash needs as well as any cash needs relating to our stock repurchase program. Furthermore, our existing cash balance and the availability of additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility provide additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required. Financing Arrangements The financing arrangements and principal terms of our $545.0 million principal amount of 4.875% senior unsecured notes due 2027 and $300.0 million principal amount of 5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2029, and $734.7 million senior secured notes due 2024 which were outstanding at December 31, 2019 , and our $400.0 million revolving credit facility, are discussed further in Note 12, Financing Arrangements, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. As of December 31, 2019 , we were in compliance with the covenants of all of our debt agreements, and we believe we will continue to meet such covenants. Environmental Liabilities As of December 31, 2019 over 2018 (in thousands) 2019 2018 $ Change % Change Closure and post-closure liabilities $ 75,651 $ 69,931 $ 5,720 8.2 % Remedial liabilities 114,173 121,017 (6,844 ) (5.7 )% Total environmental liabilities $ 189,824 $ 190,948 $ (1,124 ) (0.6 )% Total environmental liabilities as of December 31, 2019 were $189.8 million , a decrease of $1.1 million compared to December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to expenditures of $18.7 million , partially offset by accretion of $10.1 million , changes in environmental liability estimates recorded to the consolidated balance sheet of $3.9 million and new asset retirement obligations and liabilities assumed in acquisitions of $2.9 million. We anticipate our environmental liabilities, substantially all of which we assumed in connection with our acquisitions, will be payable over many years and that cash flow from operations will generally be sufficient to fund the payment of such liabilities when required. However, events not anticipated (such as future changes in environmental laws and regulations) could require that such payments be made earlier or in greater amounts than currently anticipated, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. Conversely, the development of new treatment technologies or other circumstances may arise in the future which may reduce amounts ultimately paid. 37 Table Of Contents During 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , we recognized a net benefit of $0.3 million , net charge of $2.1 million and net benefit of $0.2 million , respectively, for changes in estimates of recorded environmental liabilities. Generally, we recognize benefits primarily due to the successful introduction of new technology for remedial activities, favorable results from environmental studies of the on-going remediation, including favorable regulatory approvals and lower project costs realized by utilizing internal labor and equipment. In 2018 , the net increase in our environmental liabilities from changes in estimates recorded to the consolidated statement of operations was $2.1 million and primarily related to an increase in projected cleanup costs at third party Superfund sites where we are a potentially responsible party. Contractual Obligations The following table has been included to assist in understanding our debt and similar obligations as of December 31, 2019 and our ability to meet such contractual obligations (in thousands): Payments due in Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years Closure, post-closure and remedial liabilities (1) $ 458,409 $ 24,300 $ 51,804 $ 28,304 $ 354,001 Current and long-term obligations, at par 1,579,697 7,535 15,071 712,091 845,000 Interest on current and long-term obligations (2) 477,233 71,769 142,615 127,127 135,722 Finance leases 65,222 2,733 5,618 5,720 51,151 Operating leases 187,525 50,814 69,757 38,510 28,444 Total contractual obligations $ 2,768,086 $ 157,151 $ 284,865 $ 911,752 $ 1,414,318 ___________________________________________ (1) The undiscounted value of closure, post-closure and remedial liabilities of $458.4 million is equivalent to the present value of $189.8 million based on discounting of $178.5 million and the undiscounted remainder of $90.1 million to be accrued for closure and post-closure liabilities over the remaining site lives. (2) Interest on our variable-rate $734.7 million senior secured term loans was calculated based on the effective interest rate of that debt as of December 31, 2019 . Our interest rate swap agreements effectively fix the interest rate on $350.0 million of that variable rate debt at an annual rate of approximately 4.67% , while the remaining balance pays interest based upon LIBOR and an applicable margin. The assumed rate reflected in the table above for this variable rate debt after considering the swap agreements is 4.06% . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We obtain standby letters of credit as security for financial assurances we have been required to provide to regulatory bodies for our hazardous waste facilities and which would be called only in the event that we fail to satisfy closure, post-closure and other obligations under the permits issued by those regulatory bodies for such licensed facilities. As of December 31, 2019 , there were $146.9 million outstanding letters of credit. See Note 12, "Financing Arrangements," to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of our standby letters of credit and other financing arrangements. Except for our obligations under letters of credit described above and performance obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business, we are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements involving guarantee, contingency or similar obligations to entities whose financial statements are not consolidated with our results, and that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that would be material to investors in our securities. Capital Expenditures In 2019 , our capital expenditures, net of disposals, were $204.7 million . We anticipate that 2020 capital spending, net of disposals, will be in the range of $215.0 million to $240.0 million, inclusive of $20.0 million to $25.0 million for the purchase of our corporate headquarters in January 2020 and some expected capital improvements to that facility during 2020. However, unanticipated changes in environmental regulations could require us to make significant capital expenditures for our facilities and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. 38 Table Of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies," to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. We believe that, of our significant accounting policies, the following contain estimates that involve a higher degree of complexity in their application: accounting for landfills, non-landfill closure and post-closure liabilities, remedial liabilities, goodwill, permits and other intangible assets and legal matters. Our management reviews critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on an ongoing basis and as needed prior to the release of our annual financial statements. Landfill Accounting. We amortize landfill improvements and certain landfill-related permits over their estimated useful lives. The units-of-consumption method is used to amortize land, landfill cell construction, asset retirement costs and remaining landfill cells and sites. We also utilize the units-of-consumption method to record closure and post-closure obligations for landfill cells and sites. Under the units-of-consumption method, we include future estimated construction and asset retirement costs, as well as costs incurred to date, in the amortization base of the landfill assets. Additionally, where appropriate, as discussed below, we include probable expansion airspace yet to be permitted in the calculation of the total remaining useful life of the landfill. If we determine that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher amortization expense. If at any time we decide to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. Landfill Assets. Landfill assets include the costs of landfill site acquisition, permits and cell construction incurred to date. These amounts are amortized under the units-of-consumption method such that the asset is completely amortized when the landfill ceases accepting waste. Landfill Capacity. Landfill capacity, which is the basis for the amortization of landfill assets and for the accrual of final closure and post-closure obligations, represents total permitted airspace plus unpermitted airspace that management believes is probable of ultimately being permitted based on established criteria. Our management applies the following criteria for evaluating the probability of obtaining a permit for future expansion airspace at existing sites, which provides management a basis to evaluate the likelihood of success of unpermitted expansions: Personnel are actively working to obtain the permit or permit modifications (land use, state and federal) necessary for expansion of an existing landfill, and progress is being made on the project. Management expects to submit the application within the next year and to receive all necessary approvals to accept waste within the next five years. At the time the expansion is included in management's estimate of the landfill's useful economic life, it is probable that the required approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located. We have a legal right to use or obtain the right to use the land associated with the expansion plan through title or lease. There are no significant known political, technical, legal or business restrictions or other issues that could impair the success of such expansion. Management is committed to pursuing the expansion which is supported by a complete financial feasibility analysis which demonstrates that the expansion will have a positive financial and operational impact. Additional airspace and related additional costs, including permitting, final closure and post-closure costs have been estimated based on the conceptual design of the proposed expansion. As of December 31, 2019 , there were no unpermitted expansions included in management's landfill calculation. If actual expansion airspace is significantly different from management's estimate of expansion airspace, the amortization rates used for the units-of-consumption method would change, therefore impacting our profitability. If we determine that there is less actual expansion airspace at a landfill, this would increase amortization expense recorded and decrease profitability, while if we determine a landfill has more actual expansion airspace, amortization expense would decrease and profitability would increase. Landfill Final Closure and Post-Closure Liabilities. The balance of landfill final closure and post-closure liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $39.4 million and $37.8 million , respectively. We have material financial commitments for the costs associated with requirements of the EPA and the comparable regulatory agency in Canada for landfill final closure and post-closure activities. In the United States, the landfill final closure and post-closure requirements are established under the standards of the EPA, and are implemented and applied on a state-by-state basis. We develop estimates for the cost of these 39 Table Of Contents activities based on our evaluation of site-specific facts and circumstances, such as the existence of structures and other landfill improvements that would need to be dismantled, the amount of groundwater monitoring and leachate management expected to be performed and the length of the post-closure period as determined by the applicable regulatory agency. Included in our cost estimates are our interpretation of current regulatory requirements and proposed regulatory changes. Such estimates may change in the future due to various circumstances including, but not limited to, permit modifications, changes in legislation or regulations, technological changes and results of environmental studies. We perform zero-based reviews of these estimated liabilities based upon a planned schedule, typically every five years or sooner if the occurrence of a significant event is likely to change the timing or amount of the currently estimated expenditures. We consider a significant event to be a new regulation or an amendment to an existing regulation, a new permit or modification to an existing permit or a change in the market price of a significant cost item. Our cost estimates are calculated using internal sources as well as input from third-party experts. These costs are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques, and therefore changes in the estimated timing of closure and post-closure activities would affect the liability, the value of the related asset and our results of operations. Final closure costs are the costs incurred after the site ceases to accept waste, but before the landfill is certified as closed by the applicable state or provincial regulatory agency. These costs generally include the costs required to cap the final cell of the landfill (if not included in cell closure), dismantle certain structures for landfills and other landfill improvements and regulation-mandated groundwater monitoring and leachate management. Post-closure costs involve the maintenance and monitoring of a landfill site that has been certified closed by the applicable regulatory agency. These costs generally include groundwater monitoring and leachate management. Regulatory post-closure periods are generally 30 years after landfill closure. Final closure and post-closure obligations are accrued on a units-of-consumption basis, such that the present value of the final closure and post-closure obligations are fully accrued at the date the landfill discontinues accepting waste. Non-Landfill Closure and Post-Closure Liabilities. The balance of our non-landfill closure and post-closure liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $36.3 million and $32.1 million , respectively. We base estimates for non-landfill closure and post-closure liabilities on our interpretations of existing permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure maintenance and monitoring. Our cost estimates are calculated using internal sources as well as input from third-party experts. We estimate when future operations will cease and inflate the current cost of closing the non-landfill facility using the appropriate inflation rate and then discounting the future value to arrive at an estimated present value of closure and post-closure costs. The estimates for non-landfill closure and post-closure liabilities are inherently uncertain due to the possibility that permit and regulatory requirements will change in the future, impacting the estimation of total costs and the timing of the expenditures. We review non-landfill closure and post-closure liabilities for changes to key assumptions that would impact the amount of the recorded liabilities. Changes that would prompt us to revise a liability estimate include changes in legal requirements that impact our expected closure plan or scope of work, in the market price of a significant cost item, in estimates as to when future operations may cease or in the expected timing of the cost expenditures. Changes in estimates for non-landfill closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the value of the corresponding asset. If a change is made to a fully-amortized asset, the adjustment is charged immediately to expense. When a change in estimate relates to an asset that has not been fully amortized, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of amortization. Historically, material changes to non-landfill closure and post-closure estimates have been infrequent. See Note 10, "Closure and Post-Closure Liabilities," to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for the changes to these Landfill and Non-Landfill Closure and Post-Closure liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Remedial Liabilities. The balance of our remedial liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $114.2 million and $121.0 million , respectively. See Note 11, "Remedial Liabilities," to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for the changes to the remedial liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Remedial liabilities are obligations to investigate, alleviate and/or eliminate the effects of a release (or threat of a release) of hazardous substances into the environment and may also include corrective action under RCRA. Our remediation obligations can be further characterized as legal, superfund, long-term maintenance and one-time projects. Legal liabilities are typically comprised of litigation matters that involve potential liability for certain aspects of environmental cleanup and can include third-party claims for property damage or bodily injury allegedly arising from or caused by exposure to hazardous substances originating from our activities or operations or, in certain cases, from the actions or inactions of other persons or companies. Superfund liabilities are typically claims alleging that we are a potentially responsible party ("PRP") and/or are potentially liable for environmental response, removal, remediation and cleanup costs at/or from either a facility we own or a site owned by a third-party. As described in Note 18, "Commitments and Contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report, Superfund liabilities also include certain liabilities payable to government entities for which we are potentially liable to reimburse the sellers in connection with our 2002 acquisition of substantially all of the assets of the Chemical Services Division (the "CSD assets") of Safety-Kleen Corp. Long-term maintenance liabilities include the costs of groundwater monitoring, treatment system operations, permit fees and facility maintenance for inactive operations. One-time projects liabilities include the costs necessary to comply with regulatory requirements for the removal or treatment of contaminated materials. 40 Table Of Contents Amounts recorded related to the costs required to remediate a location are determined by internal engineers and operational personnel and incorporate input from external third parties. The estimates consider such factors as the nature and extent of environmental contamination (if any); the terms of applicable permits and agreements with regulatory authorities as to cleanup procedures and whether modifications to such permits and agreements will likely need to be negotiated; the cost of performing anticipated cleanup activities based upon current technology; and in the case of Superfund and other sites where other parties will also be responsible for a portion of the cleanup costs, the likely allocation of such costs and the ability of such other parties to pay their share. Each quarter, our management discusses if any events have occurred or milestones have been met that would warrant the creation of a new remedial liability or the revision of an existing remedial liability. Such events or milestones include identification and verification as a PRP, receipt of a unilateral administrative order under Superfund or requirement for RCRA interim corrective measures, completion of the feasibility study under Superfund or the corrective measures study under RCRA, new or modifications to existing permits, changes in property use or a change in the market price of a significant cost item. Remedial liabilities are inherently difficult to estimate and there is a risk that the actual quantities of contaminants could differ from the results of the site investigation, which could materially impact the amount of our liability. It is also possible that chosen methods of remedial solutions will not be successful and funds will be required for alternative solutions. Remedial liabilities are discounted when the timing of the payments is estimable and the amounts are determinable, with the exception of remedial liabilities assumed as part of an acquisition that are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. We establish reserves for estimated environmental liabilities based on acceptable technologies when we determine the liability is appropriate. Introductions of new technologies are subject to successful demonstration of the effectiveness of the alternative technology and regulatory approval. We routinely review and evaluate the sites for which we have established estimated environmental liabilities reserves to determine if there should be changes in the established reserves. The changes in estimates are reflected as adjustments in the ordinary course of business in the period when we determine that an adjustment is appropriate as new information becomes available. Upon demonstration of the effectiveness of the alternative technology and applicable regulatory approval, we update our estimated cost of remediating the affected sites. Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets . Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually as of December 31 or when events or changes in the business environment indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. This review is performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a loss is recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value up to the carrying amount of goodwill. We determine our reporting units by identifying the components of each operating segment, and then in some circumstances aggregate components having similar economic characteristics based on quantitative and/or qualitative factors. As of December 31, 2019 , we have four reporting units, consisting of Environmental Sales and Service, Environmental Facilities, Safety-Kleen Oil and Safety-Kleen Environmental Services. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill for all of our reporting units to which goodwill was allocated as of December 31, 2019 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill for any reporting unit was then necessary. In all cases the estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value. We measure fair value for all of our reporting units using an income approach (a discounted cash flow analysis) which incorporates several estimates and assumptions with varying degrees of uncertainty. The discounted cash flow analyses include estimated cash flows for a discrete period and for a terminal period thereafter. We corroborate our estimates of fair values by also considering other factors such as the fair value of comparable companies to businesses contained in our reporting units, as well as performing a reconciliation of the total estimated fair value of all reporting units to our market capitalization. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually as of December 31, or when events or changes in the business environment indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. If the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test to determine the fair value. The impairment loss, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. The estimated fair values of the indefinite-lived intangibles exceeded their carrying values at December 31, 2019 . However, we will continue to monitor the performance of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, and future events might result in an impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our long-lived assets are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. Long-lived assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be entirely recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, our management compares the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets to the respective carrying amounts. The impairment loss, if any, would be measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. Any resulting impairment losses recorded by us would have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 41 Table Of Contents In consideration of historical goodwill impairments for our Oil and Gas Field Services and Lodging Services operations and continued lower than historical results in the oil and gas related industries, specifically in Western Canada, we continue to monitor the carrying value of those businesses long-lived assets and assess the risk of asset impairment. We concluded that no events or circumstances have arisen during 2019 which would indicate that the carrying values of those asset groups are not recoverable. We will continue to evaluate all of our goodwill and other long-lived assets impacted by economic downturns most predominantly in the oil and gas related markets in which we operate. If further economic difficulties resulting from depressed oil and gas related pricing and lower overall activity levels, particularly in our Canadian operations, continue for a significant foreseeable period of time and thus future operating results are significantly less than current expectations, additional impairment charges may be recognized. The market conditions which could lead to such future impairments are currently most prevalent in our Oil and Gas Field Services and Lodging Services operations within the Environmental Sales & Services reporting unit. Legal Matters. As described in Note 18, "Commitments and Contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report, we are subject to legal proceedings which relate to our past acquisitions or which have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Accruals are established for legal matters when, in our opinion, it is probable that a liability exists and the liability can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2019 , we had reserves of $26.0 million consisting of (i) $18.4 million related to pending legal or administrative proceedings, including Superfund liabilities, which were included in remedial liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and (ii) $7.6 million primarily related to legal claims as well as federal, state and provincial enforcement actions, which were included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. In management's opinion, it is not reasonably possible that the potential liability in excess of what is recorded, if any, that may result from these actions, either individually or collectively, will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 42 Table Of Contents
