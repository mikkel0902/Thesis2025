Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Overview We are one of the largest casual dining restaurant companies in the world with a portfolio of leading, differentiated restaurant concepts. As of December 30, 2018 , we owned and operated 1,193 restaurants and franchised 297 restaurants across 48 states, Puerto Rico, Guam and 20 countries. We have four founder-inspired concepts: Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and Fleming Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar. Executive Summary Our 2018 financial results include: A decrease in total revenues of 2.3% to $4.1 billion in 2018 as compared to 2017 , driven primarily by restaurant sales during the 53rd week of 2017, domestic refranchising and the effect of foreign currency translation. This decrease was partially offset by higher comparable restaurant sales and the net impact of restaurant openings and closures. Income from operations increased to $145.3 million in 2018 as compared to $138.7 million in 2017 , primarily due to increases in average check per person, productivity initiatives, lower general and administrative expense, and lower impairment charges and restaurant closing costs. These increases were partially offset by commodity, labor and operating expense inflation, the impact of the 53rd week in 2017, increased rent expense and increased depreciation and amortization expense. Following is a summary of factors that impacted our operating results and liquidity in 2018 and significant actions we have taken during the year: International Restructuring - During the thirteen weeks and fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, we recognized asset impairment and closure charges of $4.8 million and $13.9 million , respectively, related to restructuring of certain international markets, including Puerto Rico and China. Express Concept Restructuring - During the thirteen weeks and fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, we recognized asset impairment of $7.4 million related to the restructuring of our Express concept. As a part of the restructuring, three Express locations closed in January 2019. Assets Held for Sale - In December 2018, we signed a purchase agreement with a buyer to sell 18 of our existing U.S. Company-owned Carrabba Italian Grill locations for $3.6 million , less certain purchase price adjustments. In connection with the decision to sell these restaurants, we recognized impairment charges of $5.5 million . After the expected completion of the sale in the first half of 2019, these restaurant locations will be operated as franchises. See Note 4 - Disposals of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Share Repurchase Programs and Dividends - We repurchased 5.1 million shares of common stock during 2018 for a total of $114.0 million and paid $33.3 million of dividends. On February 12, 2019 , our Board canceled the remaining $36.0 million of authorization under the 2018 Share Repurchase Program and approved a new $150.0 million authorization. The 2019 Share Repurchase Program will expire on August 12, 2020 . 33 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued Impact of Political Unrest in Brazil Recently, unrest in Brazil ahead of the October presidential election, including a truckers strike, resulted in lost operating days for many businesses, including our restaurants. We have already seen stronger trends in Brazil, including positive comparable restaurant sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 and believe consumer confidence will resume an upward trend in 2019. Fiscal Year We utilize a 52-53 week year ending on the last Sunday in December. In a 52 week fiscal year, each of our quarterly periods comprise 13 weeks. The additional operating week in a 53 week fiscal year is added to the fourth quarter. Fiscal year 2017 consisted of 53 weeks and fiscal years 2018 and 2016 consisted of 52 weeks. The additional operating week during fiscal year 2017 resulted in increases of $80.4 million of Total revenues and $0.11 of diluted earnings per share. Business Strategies In 2019 , our key business strategies include: Enhance the 360-Degree Customer Experience. We plan to continue to make investments to enhance our core guest experience, increase off-premises dining occasions, remodel and relocate restaurants, invest in digital marketing and data personalization and utilize the Dine Rewards loyalty program and multimedia marketing campaigns to drive traffic. Maximize International Opportunity. We continue to focus on existing geographic regions in South America, with strategic expansion in Brazil, and pursue global franchise opportunities. Drive Long-Term Shareholder Value. We plan to drive long-term shareholder value by reinvesting operational cash flow into our business, improving our credit profile and returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Enrich Engagement Among Stakeholders. We take the responsibility to our people, customers and communities seriously and continue to invest in programs that support the wellbeing of those engaged with us. We intend to fund our business strategies, drive revenue growth and margin improvement, in part by reinvesting savings generated by productivity initiatives across our businesses. 34 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued Key Performance Indicators Key measures that we use in evaluating our restaurants and assessing our business include the following: Average restaurant unit volumes average sales (excluding gift card breakage) per restaurant to measure changes in consumer traffic, pricing and development of the brand; Comparable restaurant sales year-over-year comparison of sales volumes (excluding gift card breakage) for Company-owned restaurants that are open 18 months or more in order to remove the impact of new restaurant openings in comparing the operations of existing restaurants; System-wide sales total restaurant sales volume for all Company-owned and franchise restaurants, regardless of ownership, to interpret the overall health of our brands; Restaurant-level operating margin, Income from operations, Net income and Diluted earnings per share financial measures utilized to evaluate our operating performance. Restaurant-level operating margin is widely regarded in the industry as a useful metric to evaluate restaurant level operating efficiency and performance of ongoing restaurant-level operations, and we use it for these purposes, overall and particularly within our two segments. Our restaurant-level operating margin is expressed as the percentage of our Restaurant sales that Cost of sales, Labor and other related and Other restaurant operating expense (including advertising expenses) represent, in each case as such items are reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The following categories of our revenue and operating expenses are not included in restaurant-level operating margin because we do not consider them reflective of operating performance at the restaurant-level within a period: (i) Franchise and other revenues which are earned primarily from franchise royalties and other non-food and beverage revenue streams, such as rental and sublease income. (ii) Depreciation and amortization which, although substantially all is related to restaurant-level assets, represent historical sunk costs rather than cash outlays for the restaurants. (iii) General and administrative expense which includes primarily non-restaurant-level costs associated with support of the restaurants and other activities at our corporate offices. (iv) Asset impairment charges and restaurant closing costs which are not reflective of ongoing restaurant performance in a period. Restaurant-level operating margin excludes various expenses, as discussed above, that are essential to support the operations of our restaurants and may materially impact our Consolidated Statement of Operations. As a result, restaurant-level operating margin is not indicative of our consolidated results of operations and is presented exclusively as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, net income or income from operations. In addition, our presentation of restaurant operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry; Adjusted restaurant-level operating margin, Adjusted income from operations, Adjusted net income, Adjusted diluted earnings per share non-GAAP financial measures utilized to evaluate our operating performance, which definitions, usefulness and reconciliations are described in more detail in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below; and Consumer satisfaction scores measurement of our consumers experiences in a variety of key areas. 35 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC.

The decrease in Restaurant sales in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to: (i) restaurant sales during the 53rd week of 2017, (ii) domestic refranchising in 2017, (iii) the effect of foreign currency translation, due to the depreciation of the Brazilian Real and (iv) the closing of 65 restaurants since December 25, 2016 . The decrease in Restaurant sales was partially offset by higher comparable restaurant sales and sales from 49 new restaurants not included in our comparable restaurant sales base. The decrease in Restaurant sales in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to refranchising internationally and domestically and the closing of 57 restaurants since December 27, 2015 . The decrease in Restaurant sales was partially offset by: (i) restaurant sales during the 53rd week of 2017, (ii) sales from 69 new restaurants not included in our comparable restaurant sales base, (iii) higher comparable restaurant sales and (iv) the effect of foreign currency translation, due to the appreciation of the Brazilian Real. 38 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC.

The increase in income from operations during 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to: (i) increases in average check per person, (ii) the impact of certain cost saving initiatives, (iii) lower general and administrative expense and (iv) lower impairment charges and restaurant closing costs. These increases were partially offset by: (i) commodity, labor and operating expense inflation, (ii) the impact of the 53rd week in 2017, (iii) increased rent expense and (iv) higher depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in income from operations during 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower impairment charges, primarily related to the 2017 Closure Initiative and refranchising of Outback Steakhouse South Korea in 2016, the impact of the 53rd week in 2017, increases in franchise and other revenues and increases in average check per person. These increases were partially offset by higher general and administrative expense and labor costs.

These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense from our derivative instruments and repayment of our mortgage loan in 2017. The decrease in Interest expense, net in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to refinancing of the 2012 CMBS loan in February 2016 and subsequent repayment of our mortgage loan in April 2017, partially offset by additional draws on our revolving credit facility and increasing interest rates.

The net decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% as part of the Tax Act. The remaining decrease was primarily due to employment-related credits being a higher percentage of net income in 2018 and excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation arrangements recorded in 2018. These decreases were partially offset by the domestic manufacturing deduction and the cumulative effect of the Tax Act recorded in 2017. The net decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to impairment and additional tax liabilities recorded in connection with the refranchising of Outback Steakhouse South Korea in 2016. The remaining decrease was primarily due to a domestic manufacturing deduction and excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation arrangements recorded in 2017. These decreases were mostly offset by employment-related credits being a lower percentage of net income in 2017 relative to 2016 and the impact of implementing the Tax Act. The effective income tax rate for 2018 was lower than the blended federal and state statutory rate of approximately 26%, primarily due to the benefit of tax credits for FICA taxes on certain employees tips and excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation arrangements. The effective income tax rate for 2017 was lower than the blended federal and state statutory rate of approximately 39%, primarily due to the benefit of tax credits for FICA taxes on certain employees tips and the cumulative effective of the Tax Act. The effective income tax rate for 2016 was lower than the 45 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued blended federal and state statutory rate of approximately 39%, primarily due to the benefit of tax credits for FICA taxes on certain employees tips. Segments We consider our restaurant concepts and international markets to be operating segments, which reflects how we manage our business, review operating performance and allocate resources. Resources are allocated and performance is assessed by our Chief Executive Officer, whom we have determined to be our Chief Operating Decision Maker. We aggregate our operating segments into two reportable segments, U.S. and International. The U.S. segment includes all restaurants operating in the U.S. while restaurants operating outside the U.S. are included in the International segment. Revenues for both segments include only transactions with customers and excludes intersegment revenues. Excluded from income from operations for U.S. and International are legal and certain corporate costs not directly related to the performance of the segments, most stock-based compensation expenses and certain bonus expenses. Refer to Note 20 - Segment Reporting of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of segment income (loss) from operations to the consolidated operating results.

The decrease in U.S. Restaurant sales in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to: (i) restaurant sales during the 53rd week of 2017, (ii) the refranchising of certain Company-owned restaurants during 2017 and (iii) the closing of 52 restaurants since December 25, 2016 . The decrease in U.S. Restaurant sales was partially offset by higher comparable restaurant sales and sales from 15 new restaurants not included in our comparable restaurant sales base. The decrease in U.S. Restaurant sales in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the refranchising of certain Company-owned restaurants during 2017 and the closing of 52 restaurants since December 27, 2015 . The decrease in U.S. Restaurant sales was partially offset by: (i) restaurant sales during the 53rd week of 2017, (ii) sales from 21 new restaurants not included in our comparable restaurant sales base and (iii) higher comparable restaurant sales. Income from operations The decrease in U.S. income from operations generated in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to: (i) labor, commodity and operating expense inflation, (ii) the impact of the 53rd week in 2017, (iii) increased rent expense and (iv) higher depreciation and amortization expense. These decreases were partially offset by: (i) increases in average check per person, (ii) the impact of certain cost saving initiatives and (iii) lower impairment and restaurant closing costs, primarily related to the Closure Initiatives and the remeasurement of certain surplus properties in 2017.

The decrease in Restaurant sales in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to: (i) the effect of foreign currency translation due to depreciation of the Brazilian Real, (ii) the closing of 13 restaurants since December 25, 2016 and (iii) lower comparable restaurant sales. The decrease in Restaurant sales was partially offset by sales from 34 new restaurants not included in our comparable restaurant sales base. The increase in Restaurant sales in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to: (i) sales from 48 new restaurants not included in our comparable restaurant sales base, (ii) the effect of foreign currency translation due to appreciation of the Brazilian Real and (iii) higher comparable restaurant sales. The increase in Restaurant sales was partially offset by the refranchising of 72 Outback Steakhouse South Korea restaurants in July 2016. Income from operations The decrease in International income from operations in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to: (i) labor, operating expense and commodity inflation, (ii) impairment charges and restaurant closing costs in connection with restructuring of certain markets, including Puerto Rico and China, (iii) changes in product mix and (iv) higher advertising expense. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in average check per person and lower general and administrative expense, primarily related to foreign currency translation and lower incentive compensation. 48 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued The increase in International income from operations in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to: (i) lower impairment charges and operating costs, related to the refranchising of Outback Steakhouse South Korea in 2016, (ii) increases in average check per person, (iii) increases in franchise and other revenues and (iv) the impact of certain cost saving initiatives. These increases were partially offset by labor, commodity and operating expense inflation and higher general and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for the International segment increased primarily from the effects of foreign currency translation. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP measures, which present operating results on an adjusted basis. These are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the following: (i) system-wide sales, (ii) Adjusted restaurant-level operating margins, (iii) Adjusted income from operations and the corresponding margins, (iv) Adjusted net income and (v) Adjusted diluted earnings per share. We believe that our use of non-GAAP financial measures permits investors to assess the operating performance of our business relative to our performance based on U.S. GAAP results and relative to other companies within the restaurant industry by isolating the effects of certain items that may vary from period to period without correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. However, our inclusion of these adjusted measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items or that the items for which we have made adjustments are unusual or infrequent or will not recur. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors as they form part of the basis for how our management team and Board of Directors evaluate our operating performance, allocate resources and establish employee incentive plans. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace U.S. GAAP financial measures, and they are not necessarily standardized or comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. We maintain internal guidelines with respect to the types of adjustments we include in our non-GAAP measures. These guidelines endeavor to differentiate between types of gains and expenses that are reflective of our core operations in a period, and those that may vary from period to period without correlation to our core performance in that period. However, implementation of these guidelines necessarily involves the application of judgment, and the treatment of any items not directly addressed by, or changes to, our guidelines will be considered by our disclosure committee. Refer to the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures for descriptions of the actual adjustments made in the current period and the corresponding prior period. System-Wide Sales - System-wide sales is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes sales of all restaurants operating under our brand names, whether we own them or not. Management uses this information to make decisions about future plans for the development of additional restaurants and new concepts, as well as evaluation of current operations. System-wide sales comprise sales of Company-owned and franchised restaurants. For a summary of sales of Company-owned restaurants, refer to Note 3 - Revenue Recognition of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued The following table provides a summary of sales of franchised restaurants, which are not included in our consolidated financial results. Franchise sales within this table do not represent our sales and are presented only as an indicator of changes in the restaurant system, which management believes is important information regarding the health of our restaurant concepts and in determining our royalties and/or service fees.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued Liquidity and Capital Resources LIQUIDITY Our liquidity sources consist of cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our credit facilities. We expect to use cash primarily for general operating expenses, share repurchases and dividend payments, principal and interest payments on our debt, remodeling or relocating older restaurants, obligations related to our deferred compensation plans and investments in technology. We believe that our expected liquidity sources are adequate to fund debt service requirements, lease obligations, capital expenditures and working capital obligations during the 12 months following this filing and beyond. However, our ability to continue to meet these requirements and obligations will depend on, among other things, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue and cash flow and our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully. Cash and Cash Equivalents - As of December 30, 2018 , we had $71.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $27.5 million was held by foreign affiliates. The international jurisdictions in which we have significant cash do not have any known restrictions that would prohibit the repatriation of cash and cash equivalents. As of December 30, 2018 , we had aggregate accumulated foreign earnings of approximately $88.3 million . This amount consists mainly of historical earnings (2017 and prior) previously taxed in the U.S. under the Tax Act and post-2017 foreign earnings that we may repatriate to the U.S. without additional U.S. federal income tax. These amounts are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. See Note 18 - Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Tax Act and our indefinite reinvestment assertion. Closure Initiatives - Total aggregate future undiscounted cash expenditures of $15.7 million to $19.2 million for the Closure Initiatives, primarily related to lease liabilities, are expected to occur over the remaining lease terms with the final term ending in January 2029 . Capital Expenditures - We estimate that our capital expenditures will total approximately $175 million to $200 million in 2019 . The amount of actual capital expenditures may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things, including restrictions imposed by our borrowing arrangements. 52 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued Credit Facilities - As of December 30, 2018 , we had $1.1 billion of outstanding borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. We continue to evaluate whether we will make further payments of our outstanding debt ahead of scheduled maturities. See Note 13 - Long-term Debt, Net of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

As of December 30, 2018 , we had $378.5 million in available unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, net of letters of credit of $22.0 million . The Credit Agreement contains mandatory prepayment requirements of 50% of our annual excess cash flow, as defined in the Credit Agreement . The amount outstanding required to be prepaid may vary based on our leverage ratio and year end results. Other than the required minimum amortization premiums of $25.0 million , we do not anticipate any other payments will be required through December 29, 2019. Debt Covenants - Our Credit Agreement contains various financial and non-financial covenants. A violation of these covenants could negatively impact our liquidity by restricting our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility and cause an acceleration of the amounts due under the credit facilities. See Note 13 - Long-term Debt, Net of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , we were in compliance with our debt covenants. We believe that we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants during the next 12 months and beyond. Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk - We have variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements with eight counterparties to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate debt that have an aggregate notional amount of $400.0 million and mature on May 16, 2019 (the 2014 Swap Agreements ). We pay a weighted-average fixed rate of 2.02% on the $400.0 million notional amount and receive payments from the counterparties based on the 30-day LIBOR rate. In October 2018, we entered into variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements with 12 counterparties to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate debt (the 2018 Swap Agreements ). The 2018 Swap Agreements have an aggregate notional amount of $550.0 million , a forward start date of May 16, 2019 (the maturity date of the 2014 Swap Agreements), and mature on November 30, 2022 . Under the terms of the 2018 Swap Agreements, we will pay a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.04% on the notional amount and receive payments from the counterparties based 53 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC.

SUMMARY OF CASH FLOWS The following table presents a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: FISCAL YEAR (dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 288,074 $ 409,002 $ 340,587 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (177,296 ) (123,115 ) 295,248 Net cash used in financing activities (164,352 ) (293,505 ) (657,978 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (4,146 ) 975 2,955 Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (57,720 ) $ (6,643 ) $ (19,188 ) Operating activities - Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily as a result of the following: (i) the timing of collections of receivables, (ii) higher inventory payments, (iii) the timing of payments of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and (iv) an increase in incentive compensation payments. These decreases were partially offset by lower income tax payments. Net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily as a result of lower income tax payments and the timing of collections of holiday gift card sales from third party vendors. These increases were partially offset by lower gift card sales and the timing of purchases of inventory. Investing activities - Net cash used in investing activities during 2018 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions and proceeds from the disposal of property, fixtures and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities during 2017 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions and proceeds from refranchising transactions. Net cash provided by investing activities during 2016 consisted primarily of proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions and proceeds from the refranchising of Outback Steakhouse South Korea, partially offset by capital expenditures. Financing activities - Net cash used in financing activities during 2018 was primarily attributable to the following: (i) the repurchase of common stock, (ii) payment of cash dividends on our common stock, (iii) the net repayment of long-term debt and (iv) repayments of partner deposits and accrued partner obligations. Net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by net proceeds from share-based compensation. Net cash used in financing activities during 2017 was primarily attributable to the following: (i) repayments due to the refinancing of our former credit facility, (ii) repayment of our mortgage loan, (iii) voluntary repayments of our revolving credit facility, net of drawdowns and (iv) the repurchase of common stock.

FINANCIAL CONDITION Following is a summary of our current assets, current liabilities and working capital (deficit) as of the periods indicated: (dollars in thousands) DECEMBER 30, 2018 DECEMBER 31, 2017 Current assets $ 335,483 $ 360,209 Current liabilities 791,039 813,392 Working capital (deficit) $ (455,556 ) $ (453,183 ) Working capital (deficit) included Unearned revenue primarily from unredeemed gift cards of $342.7 million and $330.8 million as of December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , respectively. We have, and in the future may continue to have, negative working capital balances (as is common for many restaurant companies). We operate successfully with negative working capital because cash collected on restaurant sales is typically received before payment is due on our current liabilities, and our inventory turnover rates require relatively low investment in inventories. Additionally, ongoing cash flows from restaurant operations and gift card sales are used to service debt obligations and make capital expenditures. Deferred Compensation Programs - Certain Restaurant Managing Partners and Chef Partners in the U.S. ( U.S. Partners ) participate in deferred compensation programs that are subject to the rules of section 409(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The deferred compensation obligations due under these plans was $69.6 million and $96.3 million as of December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , respectively. We invest in various corporate-owned life insurance policies, which are held within an irrevocable grantor or rabbi trust account for settlement of our obligations under these deferred compensation plans. The rabbi trust is funded through our voluntary contributions and the unfunded obligations were $26.3 million and $36.6 million as of December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , respectively. We use capital to fund the deferred compensation plans and currently expect annual cash funding of $14.0 million to $16.0 million for 2019. Actual funding of the deferred compensation obligations and future funding requirements may vary significantly depending on the actual performance compared to targets, timing of deferred payments of partner contracts, forfeiture rates, number of partner participants, growth of partner investments and our funding strategy. Other Compensation Programs - Certain U.S. Partners participate in a non-qualified long-term compensation program that we fund as the obligation for each participant becomes due. DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES Dividends - In 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.09, $0.08 and $0.07 per share, respectively. In February 2019, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, payable on March 8, 2019 . Future dividend payments are dependent on our earnings, financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, surplus and other factors that our Board considers relevant. 55 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued Share Repurchases - On February 12, 2019 , our Board canceled the remaining $36.0 million of authorization under the 2018 Share Repurchase Program and approved a new $150.0 million authorization. The 2019 Share Repurchase Program will expire on August 12, 2020 . Following is a summary of our share repurchase programs as of December 30, 2018 (dollars in thousands): SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM BOARD APPROVAL DATE AUTHORIZED REPURCHASED CANCELED REMAINING 2014 December 12, 2014 $ 100,000 $ 100,000 $ $ 2015 August 3, 2015 $ 100,000 69,999 $ 30,001 $ 2016 February 12, 2016 $ 250,000 139,892 $ 110,108 $ July 2016 July 26, 2016 $ 300,000 247,731 $ 52,269 $ 2017 April 21, 2017 $ 250,000 195,000 $ 55,000 $ 2018 February 16, 2018 $ 150,000 113,967 $ $ 36,033 Total Share Repurchase Programs $ 866,589 The following table presents our dividends and share repurchases for the periods indicated: (dollars in thousands) DIVIDENDS PAID SHARE REPURCHASES (1) TOTAL Fiscal year 2018 $ 33,312 $ 113,967 $ 147,279 Fiscal year 2017 30,988 272,736 303,724 Fiscal year 2016 31,379 309,887 341,266 Fiscal year 2015 29,332 169,999 199,331 Total $ 125,011 $ 866,589 $ 991,600 ________________ (1) Excludes share repurchases for the settlement of taxes related to equity awards of $180 , $447 , and $770 for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases is dependent on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, have access to our revolving credit facility and the existence of surplus. Based on our Credit Agreement, restricted dividend payments can be made on an unlimited basis provided we are compliant with our debt covenants. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS None. 56 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued OTHER MATERIAL COMMITMENTS Our contractual obligations, debt obligations and commitments as of December 30, 2018 are summarized in the table below: PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD LESS THAN 1-3 3-5 MORE THAN (dollars in thousands) TOTAL 1 YEAR YEARS YEARS 5 YEARS Recorded Contractual Obligations Long-term debt (1) $ 1,094,775 $ 27,190 $ 64,425 $ 983,742 $ 19,418 Deferred compensation and other partner obligations (2) 85,632 20,866 37,254 17,011 10,501 Other recorded contractual obligations (3) 38,037 7,876 9,719 6,637 13,805 Unrecorded Contractual Obligations Interest (4) 213,706 49,447 99,189 45,465 19,605 Operating leases (5) 1,663,941 188,803 342,777 273,672 858,689 Purchase obligations (6) 364,250 264,798 48,659 40,815 9,978 Total contractual obligations $ 3,460,341 $ 558,980 $ 602,023 $ 1,367,342 $ 931,996 ____________________ (1) Includes capital lease obligations. Amount is net of unamortized debt issuance costs and discount of $3.5 million . (2) Includes deferred compensation obligations, deposits and other accrued obligations due to our restaurant partners. Timing and amounts of payments may vary significantly based on employee turnover, return of deposits and changes to buyout values. (3) Includes other long-term liabilities, primarily consisting of non-partner deferred compensation obligations and restaurant closing cost liabilities. As of December 30, 2018 , unrecognized tax benefits of $25.2 million were excluded from the table since it is not possible to estimate when these future payments will occur. (4) Projected future interest payments on long-term debt are based on interest rates in effect as of December 30, 2018 and assume only scheduled principal payments. Estimated interest expense includes the impact of financing obligations and our variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements. (5) Amounts represent undiscounted future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding unexercised renewal terms. (6) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. We have purchase obligations with various vendors that consist primarily of inventory, restaurant-level service contracts, advertising and technology. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these accompanying consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made and changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets - Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. For long-lived assets deployed at our restaurants, we review for impairment at the individual restaurant level. When evaluating for impairment, the total future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets are compared to the carrying amount. If the total future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 57 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued are less than the carrying amount, this may be an indicator of impairment. An impairment loss is recognized in earnings when the asset carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair value is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow model. The key estimates and assumptions used in this model are future cash flow estimates, with material changes generally driven by changes in expected use, and the discount rate. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets - Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the second fiscal quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. In considering the qualitative approach, we evaluate factors including, but not limited to, macro-economic conditions, market and industry conditions, commodity cost fluctuations, competitive environment, share price performance, results of prior impairment tests, operational stability and the overall financial performance of the reporting units. If the qualitative assessment is not performed or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated. Fair value of a reporting unit is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is estimated by utilizing a weighted average of the income approach, using a discounted cash flow model, and the market approach including the guideline public company method and guideline transaction method. The key estimates and assumptions used in these models are future cash flow estimates, which are heavily influenced by revenue growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures. The fair value of the trade name is determined through a relief from royalty method. The carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to its estimated fair value, with any excess of carrying value over fair value deemed to be an indicator of impairment. The carrying value of goodwill as of December 30, 2018 was $295.4 million , which related to our U.S. and International reporting units. We performed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of 2018 by utilizing the quantitative approach and determined that the excess of fair value over carrying value of our reporting units was substantial. Sales declines at our restaurants, unplanned increases in commodity or labor costs, deterioration in overall economic conditions and challenges in the restaurant industry may result in future impairment charges. It is possible that changes in circumstances or changes in our judgments, assumptions and estimates could result in an impairment charge of a portion or all of our goodwill or other intangible assets. Insurance Reserves - We carry insurance programs with specific retention levels or high per-claim deductibles for a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation, general or liquor liability, health, property and management liability insurance programs. For some programs, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure relating to certain risks. We record a liability for all unresolved claims and for an estimate of incurred but not reported claims at the anticipated cost that falls below our specified retention levels or per-claim deductible amounts. Our liability for insurance claims was $55.8 million and $59.4 million as of December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , respectively. In establishing our reserves, we consider certain actuarial assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions, the frequency and severity of claims and claim development history and settlement practices. Reserves recorded for workers compensation and general or liquor liability claims are discounted using the average of the one-year and five-year risk-free rate of monetary assets that have comparable maturities. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our insurance claim liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or 58 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 50 basis point change in the discount rate in our insurance claim liabilities as of December 30, 2018 , would have affected net earnings by $0.7 million in 2018 . Stock-Based Compensation - We have a stock-based compensation plan that permits the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards and other stock-based awards to our management and other key employees. We account for our stock-based employee compensation using a fair value-based method of accounting. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Expected term is estimated based on historical exercise experience of our stock options. Dividend yield is the level of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock over the expected term of our options. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect as of the grant date. Forfeitures of share-based compensation awards are recognized as they occur. Estimates and assumptions are based upon information currently available, including historical experience and current business and economic conditions. A simultaneous 10% change in our volatility, forfeiture rate, weighted-average risk-free interest rate, dividend rate and term of grant in our stock option pricing model for 2018 would not have a material effect on net income. Our performance-based share units ( PSUs ) require assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving certain Company performance criteria set forth in the award agreements. Assumptions used in our assessment are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans . If we assumed that the PSU performance conditions for stock-based awards were not met, stock-based compensation expense would have decreased by $6.9 million for 2018 . If we assumed that all granted PSU share awards met or will meet their maximum threshold, expense would have increased by $6.0 million for 2018 . Income Taxes - Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates, based on certain judgments regarding enacted tax laws and published guidance, in effect in the years in which we expect those temporary differences to reverse. As of December 30, 2018 , tax loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards that do not have a valuation allowance are expected to be recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods.We currently expect to utilize general business tax credit carryforwards within a four to six year period. However, our ability to utilize these tax credits could be adversely impacted by, among other items, a future ownership change as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. A valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be realized. Changes in assumptions regarding our level and composition of earnings, tax laws or the deferred tax valuation allowance and the results of tax audits, may materially impact the effective income tax rate. Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by U.S. and foreign tax authorities. In determining taxable income, income or loss before taxes is adjusted for differences between local tax laws and generally accepted accounting principles. A tax benefit from an uncertain position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we recognize a liability. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits requires significant management judgment regarding exposures about our various tax positions. These assumptions and probabilities are periodically reviewed and updated based upon new information. An unfavorable tax settlement generally requires the use of cash and an increase in the amount of income tax expense we recognize. 59 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued Revenue Recognition - We sell gift cards to customers in our restaurants, through our websites and through select third parties. A liability is initially established for the value of the gift card when sold. We recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer. There is uncertainty when calculating gift card breakage, the amount of gift cards which will not be redeemed, because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the effects of future events. We recognize gift card breakage revenue using estimates based on historical redemption patterns. If actual redemptions vary from the estimated breakage, gift card breakage revenue may differ from the amount recorded. We periodically update our estimates used for breakage and apply that rate to gift card redemptions. A change in our breakage rate estimates by 50 basis points would have resulted in an adjustment in our breakage revenue of $2.1 million for 2018 . Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards For a description of recently issued Financial Accounting Standards that we adopted in 2018 and, that are applicable to us and likely to have material effect on our consolidated financial statements, but have not yet been adopted, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report. 60 Table of Contents BLOOMIN BRANDS, INC.
