ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those listed in Item 1A Risk Factors and in the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements notice on page 1. Introduction As a financial holding company, we generate most of our revenue from interest on loans and investments, trust fees, and service charges. Our primary source of funding for our loans and investments are deposits held by our bank subsidiary, First Financial Bank, National Association, Abilene, Texas. Our largest expenses are salaries and related employee benefits. We measure our performance by calculating our return on average assets, return on average equity, our regulatory leverage and risk based capital ratios and our efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and noninterest income. The following discussion and analysis of the major elements of our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and consolidated statements of earnings for the years 2015 through 2017 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes, and selected financial data presented elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies We prepare consolidated financial statements based on generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and customary practices in the banking industry. These policies, in certain areas, require us to make significant estimates and assumptions. We deem a policy critical if (1) the accounting estimate required us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimate; and (2) different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on the financial statements. We deem our most critical accounting policies to be (1) our allowance for loan losses and our provision for loan losses and (2) our valuation of securities. We have other significant accounting policies and continue to evaluate the materiality of their impact on our consolidated financial statements, but we believe these other policies either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are difficult or subjective, or it is less likely they would have a material impact on our reported results for a given period. A discussion of (1) our allowance for loan losses and our provision for loan losses and (2) our valuation of securities is included in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-7. Hurricane Harvey Houston and the surrounding Gulf Coast region were significantly affected by Hurricane Harvey beginning in late August 2017 and continuing into the fourth quarter of 2017. Our Company has locations (i) north of Houston in Conroe, Willis, Tomball, Huntsville, Montgomery, Magnolia, New Waverly and Cut and Shoot and (ii) in Southeast Texas in Orange, Beaumont, Vidor, Newton, Mauriceville and Port Arthur. We continue to evaluate the effect of the hurricane on our branch facilities and our loan and investment portfolios. Our initial assessment of our physical buildings and equipment indicates damage primarily at our Mauriceville branch, and amounts not covered by insurance do not appear to be significant. At December 31, 2017, we had loans totaling $446.62 million in our Conroe region and $396.55 million in the Southeast Texas/Orange region. We are evaluating these loans and the related collateral and business operations underlying such loans. At December 31, 2017, we provided additional 34 Table of Contents allowance for loan losses as deemed appropriate based on this analysis. We continue to evaluate these loans as we learn more information about the damage caused by the hurricane. Our tax exempt municipal bonds in the counties of Texas effected by the hurricane have been evaluated, including insurance on the bonds. At December 31, 2017, our municipal bonds in these counties totaled $458.16 million, but only $92.75 million do not have bond insurance. Based on analysis of these bonds and the related municipality, at December 31, 2017, we do not believe we have any credit related losses other than temporary impairment. Acquisitions and Asset Purchase On October 12, 2017, we entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization to acquire Commercial Bancshares, Inc. and its wholly owned bank subsidiary, Commercial State Bank, Kingwood, Texas. On January 1, 2018, the transaction closed. Pursuant to the agreement, we issued 1,289,371 shares of the Company common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Commercial Bancshares, Inc. In addition, in accordance with the plan of reorganization, Commercial Bancshares, Inc. paid a special dividend totaling $22.08 million to its shareholders prior to the closing of this transaction. At the closing, Kingwood Merger Sub., Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, merged into Commercial Bancshares Inc., with Commercial Bancshares, Inc. surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Immediately following such merger, Commercial Bancshares, Inc. was merged into the Company and Commercial State Bank, Kingwood, Texas was merged into First Financial Bank, National Association, Abilene, Texas, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The total purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value net of assets acquired by approximately $31.24 million and the Company recorded such excess as goodwill. The balance sheet and results of operations of Commercial Bancshares, Inc. will be included in the financial statements of the Company effective January 1, 2018. On April 1, 2015, we entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization to acquire FBC Bancshares, Inc. and its wholly owned bank subsidiary, First Bank, N.A., Conroe, Texas. On July 31, 2015, the transaction was completed, which we refer to herein as the Conroe acquisition. Pursuant to the agreement, we issued 1,755,374 shares of the Company common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of FBC Bancshares, Inc. At closing, FBC Bancshares, Inc. was merged into the Company and First Bank, N.A., Conroe, Texas, was merged into First Financial Bank, National Association, Abilene, Texas, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The total purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value net of assets acquired by approximately $43.92 million and the Company recorded such excess as goodwill. On April 8, 2015, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement with 4Trust Mortgage, Inc. for a cash purchase price of $1.90 million. The asset purchase was finalized on June 1, 2015, which we refer to herein as the 4Trust asset purchase. The total asset purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value net of assets purchased by approximately $1.75 million and the Company recorded such excess as goodwill. Results of Operations Performance Summary . Net earnings for 2017 were $120.37 million, an increase of $15.60 million over net earnings for 2016 of $104.77 million. Of the $15.60 million increase in net income during 2017 when compared to 2016, $7.65 million resulted from the recent enactment of tax legislation that reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. This amount represents the net effect of the Company revaluation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new tax rate. Net earnings for 2015 were $100.38 million. Disregarding the increase that resulted from the change in tax rates, the increases in net earnings for 2017 over 2016 and 2016 over 2015 were primarily attributable to growth in net interest income and noninterest income. On a basic net earnings per share basis, net earnings were $1.82 for 2017, as compared to $1.59 for 2016 and $1.55 for 2015. The return on average assets was 1.72% for 2017, as compared to 1.59% for 2016 and 1.61% for 2015. The return on average equity was 13.63% for 2017, as compared to 12.36% for 2016 and 13.60% for 2015. Excluding the $7.65 million tax adjustment mentioned above, the Company basic earnings per share would have been $1.70, its return on average assets would have been 1.61% and its return on average equity would have been 12.77% for 2017. Net Interest Income . Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on liabilities incurred to fund those assets. Our earning assets consist primarily of loans and 35 Table of Contents investment securities. Our liabilities to fund those assets consist primarily of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits. Tax-equivalent net interest income was $262.18 million in 2017, as compared to $251.78 million in 2016 and $240.48 million in 2015. The increases in 2017 compared to 2016 were largely attributable to increases in the volume of earning assets offset by rate increases on our interest bearing liabilities. Average earning assets were $6.54 billion in 2017, as compared to $6.17 billion in 2016 and $5.84 billion in 2015. Average earning assets increased $373.50 million in 2017, when compared to 2016, due primarily from increases in loans and taxable securities. Average earning assets increased $333.39 million in 2016, when compared to 2015, due primarily from increases in loans and tax exempt securities. Average interest bearing liabilities were $4.21 billion in 2017, as compared to $4.02 billion in 2016 and $3.80 billion in 2015. The yield on earning assets decreased two basis points in 2017 due to the mix of earnings assets, whereas the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased eight basis points when compared to 2016. The yield on earning assets decreased two basis points in 2016, whereas the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased three basis points when compared to 2015. Table 1 allocates the change in tax-equivalent net interest income between the amount of change attributable to volume and to rate. Table 1 Changes in Interest Income and Interest Expense (in thousands): 2017 Compared to 2016 2016 Compared to 2015 Change Attributable to Total Change Change Attributable to Total Change Volume Rate Volume Rate Short-term investments $ 443 $ 899 $ 1,342 $ 23 $ 111 $ 134 Taxable investment securities 3,464 1,735 5,199 (1,218 ) (829 ) (2,047 ) Tax-exempt investment securities (1) 1,173 677 1,850 6,548 (1,687 ) 4,861 Loans (1) (2) 4,998 851 5,849 12,037 (2,320 ) 9,717 Interest income 10,078 4,162 14,240 17,390 (4,725 ) 12,665 Interest-bearing deposits 409 3,300 3,709 219 643 862 Short-term borrowings (223 ) 351 128 24 477 501 Interest expense 186 3,651 3,837 243 1,120 1,363 Net interest income $ 9,892 $ 511 $ 10,403 $ 17,147 $ (5,845 ) $ 11,302 (1) Computed on tax-equivalent basis assuming marginal tax rate of 35%. (2) Non-accrual loans are included in loans. The net interest margin in 2017 was 4.01%, a decrease of seven basis points from 2016 which also decreased an additional four basis points from 2015. The continued decrease in our net interest margin in 2017 was largely the result of the extended period of historically low levels of short-term interest rates. We have been able to somewhat mitigate the impact of low short-term interest rates by establishing minimum interest rates on certain of our loans, improving the pricing for loan risk, and minimizing rates paid on interest bearing liabilities. The Federal Reserve increased rates 75 basis points in 2017 and 25 basis points in both 2016 and 2015 and continues to issue forward guidance plans to increase rates further in 2018. Although increasing, we expect interest rates to remain at lower levels, which will continue the downward pressure on our net interest margin. 36 Table of Contents The net interest margin, which measures tax-equivalent net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets, is illustrated in Table 2 for the years 2015 through 2017.

(2) Average balances include unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. (3) Computed on a tax-equivalent basis assuming a marginal tax rate of 35%. (4) Nonaccrual loans are included in loans. Noninterest Income . Noninterest income for 2017 was $91.02 million, an increase of $5.89 million, or 6.91%, as compared to 2016. Increases in certain categories of noninterest income included ( 1) trust fees of $4.06 million (2) ATM, interchange and credit card fees of $1.78 million and (3) service charges on deposit accounts of $1.03 million when compared to 2016. The increase in trust fees resulted from an increase in assets under management over the prior year and higher oil and gas prices that increased related to trust fees by $364 thousand over 2016. The fair value of our trust assets managed, which are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $5.13 billion at December 31, 2017, as compared to $4.37 billion at December 31, 2016. The increases in ATM, interchange and credit card fees and service charges on deposit accounts are primarily a result of increases in the number of net new accounts and debit cards. Offsetting these increases were decreases in net recoveries of $984 thousand and real estate mortgage fees of $977 thousand. Noninterest income for 2016 was $85.13 million, an increase of $11.70 million, or 15.93%, as compared to 2015. Increases in certain categories of noninterest income included (1) real estate mortgage fees of $5.68 million, (2) ATM, interchange and credit card fees of $2.05 million, (3) service charges on deposit accounts of $1.22 million and (4) trust fees of $384 thousand when compared to 2015. The increase in real estate mortgage fees primarily resulted from a stronger mortgage market and the 4Trust asset purchase on June 1, 2015. The increases in ATM, interchange and credit card fees and service charges are primarily a result of increases in the number of net new accounts and debit cards boosted by the Conroe acquisition on July 31, 2015. The increase in trust fees resulted from an increase in assets under management over the prior year offsetting the effect of the decline in oil and gas prices that reduced related trust fees by $296 thousand in 2016 compared to 2015. The fair value of our trust assets managed, which are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $4.37 billion at December 31, 2016 as compared to $3.87 billion at December 31, 2015. 37 Table of Contents ATM and interchange fees are charges that merchants pay to us and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. ATM and interchange fees consist of income from debit card usage, point of sale income for debit card transactions and ATM service fees. Federal Reserve rules applicable to financial institutions that have assets of $10 billion or more provide that the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction in the sum of 21 cents per transaction and five basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. While we currently have assets under $10 billion, we are monitoring the effect of this reduction in per transaction fee income as we approach the $10 billion asset level.

Total noninterest expense for 2017 was $173.99 million, an increase of $8.16 million, or 4.92%, as compared to 2016. Noninterest expense for 2016 amounted to $165.83 million, an increase of $16.37 million, or 10.95%, as compared to 2015. An important measure in determining whether a financial institution effectively manages noninterest expenses is the efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis and noninterest income. Lower ratios indicate better efficiency since more income is generated with a lower noninterest expense total. Our efficiency ratio for 2017 was 49.26%, as compared to 49.22% for 2016 and 47.61% for 2015. Salaries and employee benefits for 2017 totaled $95.29 million, an increase of $4.55 million, or 5.01%, as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily driven by (i) annual merit pay increases that were effective March 1, 2017 (ii) an increase in our profit sharing expenses and (iii) an increase in stock option and stock grant expense of due to the stock option grant in June 2017 and restricted stock grant in October 2017. All other categories of noninterest expense for 2017 totaled $78.70 million, an increase of $3.61 million, or 4.80%, as compared to 2016. The increase in noninterest expense was largely attributable to increases in software amortization and expense of $1.29 million from the write-off of internally developed software, operational and other losses of $1.02 million due to fraud and weather related losses and professional and service fees of $1.19 million. Offsetting these increases in 2017 were a decrease of $463 thousand in FDIC insurance due to the lower rate charged by the FDIC beginning in the third quarter of 2016. Salaries and employee benefits for 2016 totaled $90.74 million, an increase of $9.74 million, or 12.02%, as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of employees from the Conroe acquisition and the 4Trust asset purchase, annual merit pay increases and increases in healthcare claims. Offsetting these increases was a reduction in profit sharing and officer bonus expenses in 2016 when compared to 2015, which was caused by less net income growth in 2016 when compared to the prior year. 38 Table of Contents All other categories of noninterest expense for 2016 totaled $75.09 million, an increase of $6.63 million, or 9.68%, as compared to 2015. The increase in noninterest expense was largely attributable to increases in equipment expense of $1.26 million, largely resulting from the Company acquisition of Conroe. Telephone expenses increased $1.05 million due to costs to improve our technology infrastructure and professional and service fees increased $2.05 million due primarily to outsourcing expenses for certain technology providers, which offset salary costs. Offsetting these increases in 2016 were a decrease of $473 thousand in FDIC insurance due to the lower rate charged by the FDIC beginning in the third quarter of 2016.

Income tax expense was $26.82 million for 2017, as compared to $31.15 million for 2016 and $31.44 million for 2015. Our effective tax rates on pretax income were 18.22%, 22.92% and 23.85%, respectively, for the years 2017, 2016 and 2015. The effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal tax rate of 35.0% largely due to tax exempt interest income earned on certain investment securities and loans, the deductibility of dividends paid to our employee stock ownership plan and income tax deductions from the partial donation of two of our branch buildings to municipalities. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law with sweeping modifications to the Internal Revenue Code. The primary change for the Company was to lower the corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%. The Company deferred tax assets and liabilities were re-measured based on the income tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. However, the Company continues to analyze certain aspects of the Act resulting in refinement of the calculation which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. The provisional amount recorded related to the re-measurement of the Company deferred tax balance was $7.65 million, a reduction of income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. 39 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Review Loans . Our portfolio is comprised of loans made to businesses, professionals, individuals, and farm and ranch operations located in the primary trade areas served by our subsidiary bank. Real estate loans represent loans primarily for 1-4 family residences and commercial real estate, which are primarily owner-occupied. The structure of loans in the real estate mortgage area generally provides re-pricing intervals to minimize the interest rate risk inherent in long-term fixed rate loans. As of December 31, 2017, total loans held for investment were $3.49 billion, an increase of $128.26 million, as compared to December 31, 2016. As compared to year-end 2016, real estate loans increased $113.15 million, commercial loans increased $9.69 million, agricultural loans increased $10.52 million and consumer loans decreased $5.10 million. Loans averaged $3.44 billion during 2017, an increase of $102.21 million over the 2016 average balances.

Loans held-for-sale, consisting of secondary market mortgage loans, totaled $15.13 million and $26.90 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are valued using the lower of cost or market method. The Company has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income with an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on an annual basis and makes changes as appropriate. Management receives and reviews monthly reports related to loan originations, quality, concentrations, delinquencies, nonperforming and potential problem loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions, both by type of loan and geographic location. Commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower ability to operate profitably and effectively. Underwriting standards are designed to determine whether the borrower possesses sound business ethics and practices and to evaluate current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed. Commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and, secondarily, on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory, and include personal guarantees. Agricultural loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial loans. These agricultural loans are based primarily on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most agricultural loans are secured by the agriculture related assets being financed, such as farm land, cattle or equipment, and include personal guarantees. Real estate loans are also subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and agricultural loans. These loans are underwritten primarily based on projected cash flows and, secondarily, as loans secured by real estate. The repayment of real estate loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loans or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing 40 Table of Contents the Company real estate portfolio are generally diverse in terms of type and geographic location within Texas. This diversity helps reduce the exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry. Generally, real estate loans are owner-occupied which further reduces the Company risk. Consumer loan underwriting utilizes methodical credit standards and analysis to supplement the Company underwriting policies and procedures. The Company loan policy addresses types of consumer loans that may be originated and the collateral, if secured, which must be perfected. The relatively smaller individual dollar amounts of consumer loans that are spread over numerous individual borrowers also minimize the Company risk. Table 6 Maturity Distribution and Interest Sensitivity of Loans at December 31, 2017 (in thousands): The following tables summarize maturity and repricing information for the commercial and agricultural and the real estate-construction portion of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017: One Year or less After One Year Through Five Years After Five Years Total Commercial and agricultural $ 348,129 $ 222,342 $ 208,171 $ 778,642 Real estate construction 133,621 64,896 210,911 409,428 Maturities After One Year Loans with fixed interest rates $ 414,091 Loans with floating or adjustable interest rates 292,229 Asset Quality . Our loan portfolio is subject to periodic reviews by our centralized independent loan review group as well as periodic examinations by bank regulatory agencies. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in the judgment of management, the collectability of principal or interest under the original terms becomes doubtful. Nonaccrual, past due 90 days or more and still accruing, and restructured loans plus foreclosed assets were $20.12 million at December 31, 2017, as compared to $29.00 million at December 31, 2016 and $29.77 million at December 31, 2015. As a percent of loans and foreclosed assets, these assets were 0.57% at December 31, 2017, as compared to 0.86% at December 31, 2016 and 0.89% at December 31, 2015. As a percent of total assets, these assets were 0.28% at December 31, 2017, as compared to 0.43% at December 31, 2016 and 0.45% at December 31, 2015. We believe the level of these assets to be manageable and are not aware of any material classified credits not properly disclosed as nonperforming at December 31, 2017. 41 Table of Contents Supplemental Oil and Gas Information. At December 31, 2017, the Company exposure to the oil and gas industry was 1.72% of gross loans, or $60.16 million, down 23.34% from December 31, 2016 year-end levels, and consisted (based on collateral supporting the loan) of (i) development and production loans of 2.72%, (ii) oil and gas field servicing loans of 7.51%, (iii) real estate loans of 47.28%, (iv) accounts receivable and inventory of 24.47% and (v) other of 18.02%. These loans have experienced increased stress due to lower oil and gas prices although such prices improved in 2017. The Company instituted additional monitoring procedures for these loans and has classified, downgraded and charged-off loans as appropriate. The following oil and gas information is as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: December 31, 2017 2016 Oil and gas related loans $ 60,164 $ 78,483 Oil and gas related loans as a % of total loans 1.72 % 2.32 % Classified oil and gas related loans $ 20,346 $ 32,518 Nonaccrual oil and gas related loans 1,414 4,092 Net charge-offs for oil and gas related loans 50 1,145 Allowance for oil and gas related loans as a % of oil and gas loans 7.90 % 6.28 % Table 7 Nonaccrual, Past Due 90 Days or More and Still Accruing, Restructured Loans and Foreclosed Assets (in thousands, except percentages): At December 31, 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Nonaccrual loans* $ 17,670 $ 27,371 $ 28,601 $ 20,194 $ 27,926 Loans still accruing and past due 90 days or more 288 284 341 261 133 Troubled debt restructured loans** 627 701 199 226 Nonperforming loans 18,585 28,356 29,141 20,681 28,059 Foreclosed assets 1,532 644 627 1,035 3,069 Total nonperforming assets $ 20,117 $ 29,000 $ 29,768 $ 21,716 $ 31,128 As a % of loans and foreclosed assets 0.57 % 0.86 % 0.89 % 0.74 % 1.16 % As a % of total assets 0.28 0.43 0.45 0.37 0.60 * Includes $618 thousand, $1.26 million, $2.18 million, $2.15 million and $2.71 million, respectively, of purchased credit impaired loans as of December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013. ** Troubled debt restructured loans of $4.63 million, $6.86 million, $6.11 million, $9.07 million and $13.30 million, respectively, whose interest collection, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, is doubtful are included in non-accrual loans as of December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013. We record interest payments received on non-accrual loans as reductions of principal. Prior to the loans being placed on non-accrual, we recognized interest income on impaired loans as of December 31, 2017 of approximately $263 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2017. If interest on these impaired loans had been recognized on a full accrual basis during the year ended December 31, 2017, such income would have approximated $2.15 million. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-16 for more information on these assets. Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses . The allowance for loan losses is the amount we determine as of a specific date to be appropriate to absorb probable losses on existing loans in which full collectability is unlikely based on our review and evaluation of the loan portfolio. For a discussion of our methodology, see our accounting policies in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-7. The provision for loan losses was $6.53 million in 2017, as compared to $10.21 million in 2016 and $9.69 million in 2015. The continued provision for loan losses in 2017 reflects the continued growth in the loan portfolio, the continued levels of gross charge-offs and the effects related to Hurricane Harvey on the loan portfolio. As a percent of average loans, net loan charge-offs were 0.12% during 2017, 0.19% during 2016 and 0.15% during 2015. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans was 1.38% as of December 31, 2017, as compared to 1.35% as of December 31, 2016, and 1.25% as of December 31, 2015. Included in Tables 8 and 9 are further analysis of our allowance for loan losses. 42 Table of Contents Although we believe we use the best information available to make loan loss allowance determinations, future adjustments could be necessary if circumstances or economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making our initial determinations. A downturn in the economy or lower employment could result in increased levels of nonaccrual, past due 90 days or more and still accruing, restructured loans, foreclosed assets, charge-offs, increased loan loss provisions and reductions in income. Additionally, as an integral part of their examination process, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. The banking agencies could require additions to the loan loss allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations of our bank subsidiary.

Potential problem loans are those loans that are currently performing, but for which known information about trends, uncertainties or possible credit problems of the borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with present repayment terms, possibly resulting in the transfer of such loans to nonperforming status. These potential problem loans totaled $4.37 million as of December 31, 2017. Interest-Bearing Deposits in Banks. The Company had interest-bearing deposits in banks of $164.22 million and $50.28 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2017, our interest-bearing deposits in banks included $162.09 million maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, $1.46 million invested in FDIC-insured certificates of deposit and $677 thousand on deposit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (FHLB). The average balance of interest-bearing deposits in banks was $141.37 million, $58.25 million and $49.69 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The average yield on interest-bearing deposits in banks was 1.17%, 0.55% and 0.36% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Securities . At December 31, 2017, securities with a fair value of $3.09 billion were classified as securities available-for-sale. There were no securities classified as held-to-maturity at December 31, 2017. As compared to December 31, 2016, the available-for-sale portfolio at December 31, 2017, reflected (1) a decrease of $10.67 million in U.S. Treasury securities; (2) a decrease of $53.37 million in obligations of U.S. government sponsored enterprises and agencies; (3) a decrease of $143.43 million in obligations of states and political subdivisions; (4) a decrease of $40.93 million in corporate bonds and other; and (5) an increase of $475.04 million in mortgage-backed securities. As compared to December 31, 2015, the available-for-sale portfolio at December 31, 2016, reflected (1) a decrease of $127 thousand in U.S. Treasury securities; (2) a decrease of $34.85 million in obligations of U.S. government sponsored enterprises and agencies; (3) an increase of $113.15 million in obligations of states and political subdivisions; (4) a decrease of $35.56 million in corporate bonds and other; and (5) an increase of $84.33 million in mortgage-backed securities. Securities-available-for-sale included fair value adjustments of $44.86 million, $33.07 million and $79.01 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We did not hold any collateralized mortgage obligations or structured notes as of December 31, 2017 that we consider to be high risk. Our mortgage related securities are backed by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC or are collateralized by securities backed by these agencies. See Table 10 and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures relating to the maturities and fair values of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Yields on available-for-sale securities are based on amortized cost. Maturities of mortgage-backed securities are based on contractual maturities and could differ due to prepayments of underlying mortgages. Maturities of other securities are reported at the earlier of maturity date or call date. As of December 31, 2017, the investment portfolio had an overall tax equivalent yield of 3.56%, a weighted average life of 4.29 years and modified duration of 3.82 years. Deposits . Deposits held by our subsidiary bank represent our primary source of funding. Total deposits were $5.96 billion as of December 31, 2017, as compared to $5.48 billion as of December 31, 2016 and $5.19 billion as of December 31, 2015. Table 11 provides a breakdown of average deposits and rates paid over the past three years and the remaining maturity of time deposits of $100,000 or more: Table 11 Composition of Average Deposits and Remaining Maturity of Time Deposits of $100,000 or More (in thousands, except percentages): 2017 2016 2015 Average Balance Average Rate Average Balance Average Rate Average Balance Average Rate Noninterest-bearing deposits $ 1,843,973 $ 1,666,598 $ 1,634,669 Interest-bearing deposits Interest-bearing checking 1,902,699 0.27 % 1,713,498 0.12 % 1,622,331 0.09 % Savings and money market accounts 1,401,804 0.13 1,195,671 0.09 1,021,222 0.05 Time deposits under $100,000 267,754 0.13 237,419 0.18 261,255 0.20 Time deposits of $100,000 or more 211,703 0.40 322,417 0.31 367,342 0.31 Total interest-bearing deposits 3,783,960 0.22 % 3,469,005 0.13 % 3,272,150 0.11 % Total average deposits $ 5,627,933 $ 5,135,603 $ 4,906,819 As of December 31, 2017 Three months or less $ 81,918 Over three through six months 64,396 Over six through twelve months 70,470 Over twelve months 33,670 Total time deposits of $100,000 or more $ 250,454 Borrowings. Included in borrowings were federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and advances from the FHLB of $331.00 million, $445.77 million and $615.68 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Securities sold under repurchase agreements are generally with significant customers of the Company that require short-term liquidity for their funds for which we pledge certain securities that have a fair value equal to at least the amount of the short-term borrowing. The average balances of federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and advances from the FHLB were $422.29 million, $552.04 million and $524.37 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The average rates paid on federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and advances from the FHLB were 0.25%, 0.17% and 0.08% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and advances from the FHLB was 0.10%, 0.12% and 0.17% at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The highest amount of federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and advances from the FHLB at any month end during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $611.30 million, $598.77 million and $647.72 million, respectively. Capital Resources We evaluate capital resources by our ability to maintain adequate regulatory capital ratios to do business in the banking industry. Issues related to capital resources arise primarily when we are growing at an accelerated rate but not retaining a significant amount of our profits or when we experience significant asset quality deterioration. 45 Table of Contents Total shareholders equity was $922.77 million, or 12.72% of total assets at December 31, 2017, as compared to $837.89 million, or 12.30% of total assets at December 31, 2016. During 2017, total shareholders equity averaged $882.81 million, or 12.65% of average assets, as compared to $847.87 million, or 12.85% of average assets during 2016. Banking regulators measure capital adequacy by means of the risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio under the Basel III regulatory capital framework and prompt corrective action regulations. The risk-based capital rules provide for the weighting of assets and off-balance-sheet commitments and contingencies according to prescribed risk categories. Regulatory capital is then divided by risk-weighted assets to determine the risk-adjusted capital ratios. The leverage ratio is computed by dividing shareholders equity less intangible assets by quarter-to-date average assets less intangible assets. Beginning in January 2016, under the Basel III regulatory capital framework, the implementation of the capital conservation buffer was effective for the Company starting at the 0.625% level and increasing 0.625% each year thereafter, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and requires increased capital levels for the purpose of capital distributions and other payments. Failure to meet the amount of the buffer will result in restrictions on the Company ability to make capital distributions, including divided payments and stock repurchase, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a total risk-based capital ratio of 19.85% and 18.45%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 18.66% and 17.30%, a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted ratio of 18.66% and 17.30% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.09% and 10.71%, respectively. The regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 were calculated under Basel III rules. There is no threshold for well-capitalized status for bank holding companies. We performed a preliminary assessment using the regulatory capital estimation tool made available by the OCC and believe the Company and Bank are prepared to meet the new requirements upon full implementation of the Basel III rules that will be effective December 31, 2019. Our subsidiary bank made the election to continue to exclude most AOCI from capital in connection with its March 31, 2015 quarterly financial filing and, in effect, to retain the AOCI treatment under the prior capital rules. Interest Rate Risk . Interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are different. Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily through our strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that generate favorable earnings while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates. We use no off-balance-sheet financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. Our subsidiary bank has an asset liability management committee that monitors interest rate risk and compliance with investment policies. The subsidiary bank utilizes an earnings simulation model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates. The model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income and net income over the next twelve months. The model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario of hypothetical fluctuations in interest rates over the next twelve months. These simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix, pricing and the re-pricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet. As of December 31, 2017, the model simulations projected that 100 and 200 basis point increases in interest rates would result in variances in net interest income of positive 0.58% and positive 0.50%, respectively, relative to the current financial statement structure over the next twelve months, while a decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in a variance in a net interest income of negative 3.84% relative to the current financial statement structure over the next twelve months . We consider the likelihood of a decrease in interest rates beyond 100 basis points after December 31, 2017 remote given current interest rate levels. These are good faith estimates and assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at each year-end will remain constant over the relevant twelve month measurement period and that changes in market interest rates are 46 Table of Contents instantaneous and sustained across the yield curve regardless of duration of pricing characteristics on specific assets or liabilities. Also, this analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates. We believe these estimates are not necessarily indicative of what actually could occur in the event of immediate interest rate increases or decreases of this magnitude. As interest-bearing assets and liabilities re-price in different time frames and proportions to market interest rate movements, various assumptions must be made based on historical relationships of these variables in reaching any conclusion. Since these correlations are based on competitive and market conditions, we anticipate that our future results will likely be different from the foregoing estimates, and such differences could be material. Should we be unable to maintain a reasonable balance of maturities and repricing of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities, we could be required to dispose of our assets in an unfavorable manner or pay a higher than market rate to fund our activities. Our asset liability committee oversees and monitors this risk. Liquidity Liquidity is our ability to meet cash demands as they arise. Such needs can develop from loan demand, deposit withdrawals or acquisition opportunities. Potential obligations resulting from the issuance of standby letters of credit and commitments to fund future borrowings to our loan customers are other factors affecting our liquidity needs. Many of these obligations and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon; therefore the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements affecting our liquidity position. The potential need for liquidity arising from these types of financial instruments is represented by the contractual notional amount of the instrument, as detailed in Tables 12 and 13. Asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable or which will mature in the near future. Liquid assets include cash, federal funds sold, and short-term investments in time deposits in banks. Liquidity is also provided by access to funding sources, which include core depositors and correspondent banks that maintain accounts with and sell federal funds to our subsidiary bank. Other sources of funds include our ability to borrow from short-term sources, such as purchasing federal funds from correspondent banks, sales of securities under agreements to repurchase and advances from the FHLB, which amounted to $331.00 million at December 31, 2017, and an unfunded $25.00 million revolving line of credit established with Frost Bank, a nonaffiliated bank, which matures on June 2019 (see next paragraph). Our subsidiary bank also has federal funds purchased lines of credit with two non-affiliated banks totaling $130.00 million. At December 31, 2017, there were no amounts drawn on these lines of credit. Our subsidiary bank also has available a line of credit with the FHLB totaling $1.22 billion at December 31, 2017, secured by portions of our loan portfolio and certain investment securities. At December 31, 2017, no amounts were outstanding under this line of credit. The Company renewed its loan agreement, effective June 30, 2017, with Frost Bank. Under the loan agreement, as renewed and amended, we are permitted to draw up to $25.00 million on a revolving line of credit. Prior to June 30, 2019, interest is paid quarterly at The Wall Street Journal Prime Rate and the line of credit matures June 30, 2019. If a balance exists at June 30, 2019, the principal balance converts to a term facility payable quarterly over five years and interest is paid quarterly at our election at The Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus 50 basis points or LIBOR plus 250 basis points. The line of credit is unsecured. Among other provisions in the credit agreement, we must satisfy certain financial covenants during the term of the loan agreement, including, without limitation, covenants that require us to maintain certain capital, tangible net worth, loan loss reserve, non-performing asset and cash flow coverage ratios. In addition, the credit agreement contains certain operational covenants, which among others, restricts the payment of dividends above 55% of consolidated net income, limits the incurrence of debt (excluding any amounts acquired in an acquisition) and prohibits the disposal of assets except in the ordinary course of business. Since 1995, we have historically declared dividends as a percentage of our consolidated net income in a range of 37% (low) in 1995 to 53% (high) in 2003 and 2006. The Company was in compliance with the financial and operational covenants at December 31, 2017. There was no outstanding balance under the line of credit as of December 31, 2017 or 2016. In addition, we anticipate that any future acquisition of financial institutions, expansion of branch locations or offering of new products could also place a demand on our cash resources. Available cash and cash equivalents at our parent company, which totaled $78.47 million at December 31, 2017, investment securities which totaled $8.52 million at December 31, 2017 which matures over 6 to 13 years, available dividends from our subsidiaries which totaled $205.75 million at December 31, 2017, utilization of available lines of credit, and future debt or equity offerings are expected to be the source of funding for these potential acquisitions or expansions. 47 Table of Contents Given the strong core deposit base and relatively low loan to deposit ratios maintained at our subsidiary bank, we consider our current liquidity position to be adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity needs.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include unfunded lines of credit, commitments to extend credit and federal funds sold to correspondent banks and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument for unfunded lines of credit, commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of these instruments. We generally use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments. Unfunded lines of credit and commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, as we deem necessary upon extension of credit, is based on our credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant, and equipment and income-producing commercial properties. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issue to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The average collateral value held on letters of credit usually exceeds the contract amount. Table 13 Commitments as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands): Total Notional Amounts Committed Less than 1 year More than 1 year but less than 3 years More than 3 year but less than 5 years Over 5 years Unfunded lines of credit $ 534,468 $ 492,138 $ 24,394 $ 13,327 $ 4,609 Unfunded commitments to extend credit 244,658 147,735 18,401 11,781 66,741 Standby letters of credit 28,858 22,245 6,613 Total Commercial Commitments $ 807,984 $ 662,118 $ 49,408 $ 25,108 $ 71,350 We believe we have no other off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated, special purpose entities that would expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements. 48 Table of Contents Parent Company Funding . Our ability to fund various operating expenses, dividends, and cash acquisitions is generally dependent on our own earnings (without giving effect to our subsidiaries), cash reserves and funds derived from our subsidiaries. These funds historically have been produced by intercompany dividends and management fees that are limited to reimbursement of actual expenses. We anticipate that our recurring cash sources will continue to include dividends and management fees from our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2017, approximately $205.75 million was available for the payment of intercompany dividends by our subsidiaries without the prior approval of regulatory agencies. Our subsidiaries paid aggregate dividends to us of $30.80 million in 2017 and $48.80 million in 2016. Dividends . Our long-term dividend policy is to pay cash dividends to our shareholders of approximately 40% of annual net earnings while maintaining adequate capital to support growth. We are also restricted by a loan covenant within our line of credit agreement with Frost Bank to dividend no greater than 55% of net income, as defined in such loan agreement. The cash dividend payout ratios have amounted to 41.24%, 44.14% and 40.20% of net earnings, respectively, in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Given our current capital position, projected earnings and asset growth rates, we do not anticipate any significant change in our current dividend policy. Our bank subsidiary, which is a national banking association and a member of the Federal Reserve System, is required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the OCC to declare and pay dividends if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed the total of (1) such bank net profits (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for that year plus (2) its retained net profits (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. To pay dividends, we and our subsidiary bank must maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. In addition, if the applicable regulatory authority believes that a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the financial condition of the bank, could include the payment of dividends), the authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from the unsafe practice. The Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC have each indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have issued policy statements that recommend that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings.
