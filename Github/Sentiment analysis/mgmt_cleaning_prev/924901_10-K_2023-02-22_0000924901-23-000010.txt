ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of Veris Residential, Inc. and Veris Residential, L.P. and the notes thereto (collectively, the Financial Statements ). Certain defined terms used herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Financial Statements. Executive Overview Veris Residential, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, including Veris Residential, L.P. (the Operating Partnership and collectively, the Company ), has been involved in all aspects of commercial real estate development, management and ownership for over 60 years and has been a publicly traded REIT since 1994. The Company develops, owns and operates predominantly multifamily rental properties located primarily in the Northeast, as well as a portfolio of Class A office properties. The Company is in the process of transitioning to a pure-play multifamily REIT and is focused on conducting business in a socially, ethically, and environmentally responsible manner, while seeking to maximize value for all stakeholders. The General Partner controls Veris Residential, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the Operating Partnership ), as its sole general partner and owned a 90.7 and 91.0 percent common unit interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company owns or has interests in 35 properties (collectively, the Properties ) and developable land parcels. These properties are comprised of 24 multifamily rental properties containing 7,681 apartment units as well as non-core assets comprised of five office properties, four parking/retail properties and two hotels and eight properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company has investment interests, including seven multifamily properties and a non-core asset. The Properties are located in three states in the Northeast, plus the District of Columbia. 30 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the Company, its majority-owned and/or controlled subsidiaries, which consist principally of the Operating Partnership and variable interest entities for which the Company has determined itself to be the primary beneficiary, if any. See Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies to the Financial Statements, for the Company treatment of unconsolidated joint venture interests. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 810, Consolidation, provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights ( variable interest entities or VIEs ) and the determination of which business enterprise, if any, should consolidate the VIEs. Generally, the consideration of whether an entity is a VIE applies when either: (1) the equity investors (if any) lack (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity activities without additional subordinated financial support; or (3) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and substantially all of the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest. The Company consolidates VIEs in which it is considered to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the variable interest entity performance: and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and right to receive the returns from the VIE that would be significant to the VIE. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions are based on management historical experience that are believed to be reasonable at the time. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts in order to conform with current period presentation, primarily related to classification of certain properties as discontinued operations. The Company critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain. Different estimates could have a material effect on the Company financial results. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions and circumstances. Rental Property Rental properties are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Costs directly related to the acquisition, development and construction of rental properties are capitalized. The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) guidance Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2017-01 on January 1, 2017, which revises the definition of a business and is expected to result in more transactions to be accounted for as asset acquisitions and significantly limit transactions that would be accounted for as business combinations. Where an acquisition has been determined to be an asset acquisition, acquisition-related costs are capitalized. Capitalized development and construction costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development and construction costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, salaries and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Interest capitalized by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $12.2 million, $30.5 million and $26.4 million, respectively. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements which enhance or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Fully-depreciated assets are removed from the accounts. The Company considers a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the substantial completion of improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity (as distinguished from activities such as routine maintenance and cleanup). If portions of a rental project are substantially completed and occupied by tenants or residents, or held available for occupancy, and other portions have not yet reached that stage, the substantially completed portions are accounted for as a separate project. The Company allocates costs incurred between the portions under construction and the portions substantially completed and held available for occupancy, primarily based on a percentage of the relative commercial square footage or multifamily units of each portion, and capitalizes only those costs associated with the portion under construction. 31 Table of Contents Properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows: Leasehold interests Remaining lease term Buildings and improvements 5 to 40 years Tenant improvements The shorter of the term of the related lease or useful life Furniture, fixtures and equipment 5 to 10 years Upon acquisition of rental property, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed, generally consisting of the fair value of (i) above and below market leases, (ii) in-place leases and (iii) tenant relationships. For asset acquisitions, the Company allocates the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The Company records goodwill or a gain on bargain purchase (if any) if the net assets acquired/liabilities assumed differ from the purchase consideration of a business combination transaction. In estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired, the Company considers information obtained about each property as a result of its due diligence and marketing and leasing activities, and utilizes various valuation methods, such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates, estimates of replacement costs net of depreciation, and available market information. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. Above-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the remaining initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining terms of the respective leases, and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed rate renewal options of the respective leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values, which are based on management evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant lease. Factors to be considered by management in its analysis of in-place lease values include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, management considers leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. The values of in-place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases. On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company rental properties held for use may be impaired. In addition to identifying any specific circumstances which may affect a property or properties, management considers other criteria for determining which properties may require assessment for potential impairment. The criteria considered by management, depending on the type of property, may include reviewing properties with below market occupancy levels, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, construction cost overruns and/or other factors, including those that might impact the Company intent and ability to hold the property. A property value is impaired only if management estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property over its estimated holding period is less than the carrying value of the property. If there are different potential outcomes for a property, the Company will take a probability-weighted approach to estimating future cash flows. To the extent impairment has occurred, the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the property over the fair value of the property. The Company estimates of aggregate future cash flows and estimated fair values for each property are based on a number of assumptions, including but not limited to estimated holding periods, outcome probabilities, market capitalization rates and discount rates, if applicable. For developable land holdings, an estimated per-unit market value assumption is also considered based on development rights or plans for the land. These assumptions are generally based on management experience in its local real estate markets and the effects of current market conditions. The assumptions are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and costs to operate each property. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that 32 Table of Contents may alter management assumptions, the future cash flows estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be achieved, and additional losses or impairments may be realized in the future. Real Estate Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations When assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the sales price, net of expected selling costs, of such assets. The Company generally considers assets (as identified by their disposal groups) to be held for sale when the transaction has received appropriate corporate authority, it is probable to be sold within the following 12 months, and there are no significant contingencies relating to a sale. If, in management opinion, the estimated net sales price, net of expected selling costs, of the disposal groups identified as held for sale is less than the carrying value, a valuation allowance (which is recorded as unrealized losses on disposition of rental property) is established. In the absence of an executed sales agreement with a set sales price, management estimate of the net sales price may be based on a number of assumptions, including but not limited to the Company estimates of future cash flows, market capitalization rates and discount rates, if applicable. For developable land holdings, an estimated per-unit market value assumption is also considered based on development rights or plans for the land. In addition, the Company classifies assets held for sale or sold as discontinued operations if the disposal groups represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company operations and financial results. For any disposals qualifying as discontinued operations, the assets and their results are presented in discontinued operations in the financial statements for all periods presented. See Note 7: Discontinued Operations to the Financial Statements. If circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and, as a result, the Company has determined that an asset previously classified as held for sale no longer meets the held for sale criteria, the asset is reclassified as held and used. An asset that is reclassified is measured and recorded individually at the lower of (a) its carrying value before the asset was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation (amortization) expense that would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as held and used, or (b) the fair value at the date the asset, qualified as held for sale. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures The Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting. The Company applies the equity method by initially recording these investments at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. The outside basis portion of the Company joint ventures is amortized over the anticipated useful lives of the underlying ventures tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Generally, the Company would discontinue applying the equity method when the investment (and any advances) is reduced to zero and would not provide for additional losses unless the Company has guaranteed obligations of the venture or is otherwise committed to providing further financial support for the investee. If the venture subsequently generates income, the Company only recognizes its share of such income to the extent it exceeds its share of previously unrecognized losses. If the venture subsequently makes distributions and the Company does not have an implied or actual commitment to support the operations of the venture, the Company will not record a basis less than zero, rather such amounts will be recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures. On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. An investment is impaired only if management estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the value of the investment. The Company estimates of value for each investment (particularly in real estate joint ventures) are based on a number of assumptions including but not limited to estimates of future and stabilized cash flows, market capitalization rates and discount rates, if applicable. These assumptions are based on management's experience in its local real estate markets and the effects of current market conditions. The assumptions are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and operating costs. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management assumptions, the values estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be realized, and actual losses or impairment may be realized in the future. See Note 4: Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures to the Financial Statements. 33 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Revenue from leases includes fixed base rents under leases, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. Unbilled rents receivable represents the cumulative amount by which straight-line rental revenue exceeds rents currently billed in accordance with the lease agreements. The Company elected a practical expedient for its rental properties (as lessor) to avoid separating non-lease components that otherwise would need to be accounted for under the recently-adopted revenue accounting guidance (such as tenant reimbursements of property operating expenses) from the associated lease component since (1) the non-lease components have the same timing and pattern of transfer as the associated lease component and (2) the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease; this enables the Company to account for the combination of the lease component and non-lease components as an operating lease since the lease component is the predominant component of the combined components. Due to the Company adoption of the practical expedient discussed above to not separate non-lease component revenue from the associated lease component, the Company is aggregating revenue from its lease components and non-lease components (comprised predominantly of tenant operating expense reimbursements) into the line entitled Revenue from leases. Revenue from leases also includes reimbursements and recoveries from tenants received from tenants for certain costs as provided in the lease agreements. These costs generally include real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, common area maintenance and other recoverable costs. See Note 13: Tenant Leases to the Financial Statements. Real estate services revenue includes property management, development, construction and leasing commission fees and other services, and payroll and related costs reimbursed from clients. Fee income derived from the Company unconsolidated joint ventures are recognized to the extent attributable to the unaffiliated ownership interests. Parking income is comprised of income from parking spaces leased to tenants and others. Hotel income includes all revenue generated from hotel properties. Other income includes income from tenants for additional services arranged for by the Company and income from tenants for early lease terminations. All bad debt expense is recorded as a reduction of the corresponding revenue account. Management performs a detailed review of amounts due from tenants for collectability based on factors affecting the billings and status of individual tenants. The factors considered by management in determining which individual tenant revenues are affected include the age of the receivable, the tenant payment history, the nature of the charges, any communications regarding the charges and other related information. Management estimate of bad debt write-off requires management to exercise judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of collection losses, which affects the revenue recorded. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests The Company evaluates the terms of the partnership units issued in accordance with the FASB Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity guidance. Units which embody an unconditional obligation requiring the Company to redeem the units for cash after a specified or determinable date (or dates) or upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer are determined to be contingently redeemable under this guidance and are included as Redeemable noncontrolling interests and classified within the mezzanine section between Total liabilities and Stockholders equity on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests will be changed by periodic accretions, so that the carrying amount will equal the estimated future redemption value at the redemption date. 34 Table of Contents Results From Operations The following comparisons for the year ended December 31, 2022 ( 2022 ), as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 ( 2021 ), and for 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 ( 2020 ) make reference to the following: (i) Same-Store Properties, which represent all in-service properties owned by the Company at December 31, 2020, (for the 2022 versus 2021 comparisons), and which represent all in-service properties owned by the Company at December 31, 2019 (for the 2021 versus 2020 comparisons), excluding properties sold, disposed of, removed from service, or being redeveloped or repositioned from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022; (ii) Acquired and Developed Properties, which represent all properties acquired by the Company or commencing initial operation from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022 (for the 2022 versus 2021 comparisons), and which represents all properties acquired by the Company or commencing initial operations from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021 (for the 2021 versus 2020 comparisons); and (iii) Properties Sold which represent properties sold, disposed of, or removed from service (including properties being redeveloped or repositioned) by the Company from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022.

Revenue from leases for the Same-Store Properties increased $12.4 million, or 4.5 percent, for 2022 as compared to 2021, due primarily to an increase in occupancy and market rents of the multifamily rental properties, partially offset by a reduction in occupancy of the office properties in 2022 as compared to 2021. Revenue from leases at the Acquired and Developed Properties increased $28.7 million in 2022 as compared to 2021, due to the commencement of operations at a multifamily property as well as the acquisition of one multifamily property. Parking income. Parking income for the Same-Store Properties increased $3.0 million, or 20.2 percent for 2022 as compared to 2021 due primarily to an increase in usage at the parking garages. Hotel income . Hotel income for the Same-Store properties increased $4.9 million, or 46.0 percent, for 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to higher occupancy, higher average daily rates and increased events as a result of easing COVID-19 restrictions. Other income. Other income for the Same-Store Properties increased $21.6 million, or 191.4 percent for 2022 as compared to 2021 due primarily to lease termination income recognized from office properties in 2022. Real estate taxes. Real estate taxes on the Same-Store Properties increased $9.9 million, or 21.1 percent, for 2022 as compared to 2021 due primarily to increased tax rates on properties located in Jersey City, New Jersey as well as the expiration in early 2022 of the PILOT agreements on two multifamily properties. Utilities. Utilities for the Same-Store Properties remained relatively unchanged for 2022 compared to 2021. Operating services. Operating services for the Same-Store properties increased $7.2 million, or 10.1 percent, for 2022 as compared to 2021, due primarily to an increase in repairs and maintenance costs at commercial properties, and insurance expenses in 2022. 37 Table of Contents Real estate services revenue. Real estate services revenue (primarily reimbursement of property personnel costs) decreased $6.0 million, or 62.7 percent, for 2022 as compared to 2021, due primarily to a reduction in third party development and management activity in 2022. Real estate services expenses. Real estate services expenses decreased $2.3 million, or 18.0 percent, for 2022 as compared to 2021, due primarily to lower salaries and related expenses from a reduction in third-party services activities in 2022 as compared to 2021. General and administrative. General and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged for 2022 compared to 2021 due to increases in severance and related costs in 2022 as compared to 2021, partially offset by cost saving reductions in 2022. Transaction related costs. The Company incurred costs of $3.5 million in 2022 and $12.2 million in 2021 in connection with transactions that were not consummated and increased advisory fees. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $1.5 million, or 1.3 percent, for 2022 over 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase of commission amortizations of $1.6 million for Same-Store Properties for 2022 as compared to 2021, an increase of approximately $16.1 million for 2022 as compared to 2021 in the Acquired Properties, which was offset by a decrease of $15.9 million for properties sold or removed from service. Property impairments. In 2022, the Company recorded impairment charges of $94.8 million on its held and used office properties in Jersey City, New Jersey. In 2021, the Company recorded impairment charges of $7.4 million on its held and used hotel properties in Weehawken, New Jersey and $6 million on a held and used office property that has since been disposed. Land and other impairments . In 2022, the Company recorded net $9.4 million of impairments on developable land parcels. In 2021, the Company recorded $20.8 million of impairments on developable land parcels and $2.9 million of goodwill impairment. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $12.8 million, or 19.7 percent, for 2022 as compared to 2021. This increase was primarily the result of the cessation of the capitalization of mortgage interest related to a property which was placed in service in 2022 and higher interest rates on our floating rate indebtedness. Interest and other investment income. Interest and other investment income remained relatively unchanged for 2022 compared to 2021. Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures increased $5.5 million, or 128.2 percent, for 2022 as compared to 2021, due primarily to higher revenues resulting from lower concessions and higher market rents at various multifamily ventures in 2022 as compared to 2021. Realized gains (losses) and unrealized losses on disposition of rental property, net. The Company had realized gains (unrealized losses) on disposition of rental property of $66.1 million in 2022 and $3.0 million in 2021. See Note 3: Recent Transactions Dispositions to the Financial Statements. Gain on disposition of developable land. In 2022, the Company recognized a gain of $57.3 million on the sale of multiple developable land parcels. In 2021, the Company recorded a gain of $2.1 million on the sale of land holdings in Newark and Hamilton, New Jersey. Gain on sale from unconsolidated joint ventures. In 2022, the Company recorded a gain of $7.7 million on the sale of the unconsolidated joint venture hotel property in Jersey City, New Jersey. In 2021, the Company recorded a $1.9 million gain for its share on the sale the joint venture - owned property in Arlington, Virginia and land in Hillsborough, New Jersey. See Note 4: Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures to the Financial Statements. Loss from extinguishment of debt, net. In 2022, the Company recognized a loss of $7.4 million on extinguishment of debt primarily in connection with the sales of two office properties located in Hoboken, New Jersey and Jersey City, New Jersey. In 2021, the Company recognized losses from early extinguishment of debt of $47.1 million which consists of $24.2 million in connection with the redemption of the Company Senior Unsecured Notes and $22.6 million in connection with the sale of Short Hills office portfolio and related defeasement of the mortgage loan. Discontinued operations.

Revenue from leases for the Same-Store Properties increased $1.8 million, or 0.7 percent, for 2021 as compared to 2020, of which an increase of $3.4 million at the commercial properties is due to an increase in escalation settle-ups. This is partially offset by a decrease of $1.6 million of the multifamily properties, due primarily to lower in-place rents in 2021 as compared to 2020 as a result of increased rent concessions. Revenue from leases at the Acquired and Developed Properties increased $13.0 million in 2021 as compared to 2020, due to the commencement of operations of three multifamily properties and one retail property. Parking income. Parking income for the Same-Store Properties decreased $1.1 million, or 7.0 percent for 2021 as compared to 2020 due primarily to a decrease in usage at the parking garages, in 2021 as compared to 2020, which was more impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the recognition in 2020 of approximately $0.6 million income from a settlement of prior period unpaid parking fees by a tenant in Jersey City, New Jersey. Hotel income . Hotel income for the Same-Store properties increased $6.3 million, or 147.7 percent, for 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to fully reopening the hotels in 2021 following a partial shutdown of hotel operations in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Other income. Other income for the Same-Store Properties increased $1.6 million, or 17.1 percent for 2021 as compared to 2020 due primarily to the recognition in 2021 of forfeited deposits received from potential buyers in disposition deals that were not completed, as well as post property sales items received in 2021. Real estate taxes. Real estate taxes on the Same-Store Properties increased $1.7 million, or 3.7 percent, for 2021 as compared to 2020 due primarily to the expiration in early 2021 of the PILOT agreements on two multifamily properties located in Jersey City, New Jersey. Utilities. Utilities for the Same-Store Properties increased $0.9 million, or 6.6 percent, for 2021 as compared to 2020, due primarily to higher electricity rates in 2021 as compared to 2020. 41 Table of Contents Operating services. Operating services for the Same-Store properties increased $1.7 million, or 2.5 percent, for 2021 as compared to 2020, due primarily to an increase in severance and related expenses in 2021 as compared to 2020. Real estate services revenue. Real estate services revenue (primarily reimbursement of property personnel costs) decreased $1.8 million, or 15.8 percent, for 2021 as compared to 2020, due primarily to decreased third party development and management activity in 2021 as compared to 2020. Real estate services expenses. Real estate services expenses decreased $0.7 million, or 5.1 percent, for 2021 as compared to 2020, due primarily to lower salaries and related expenses from a reduction in third-party services activities in 2021 as compared to 2020. General and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased $13.9 million, or 19.5 percent in 2021 as compared to 2020. This decrease is due primarily to costs incurred for a contested election of the Board of Directors of $12.8 million in 2020 and a decrease in severance and related costs of $2.5 million ($7.6 million in 2021 versus $10.1 million in 2020). These were partially offset by $2.1 million of costs from CEO and related management changes in 2021. Dead deal and transaction costs. The Company incurred costs of $12.2 million in 2021 and $2.6 million in 2020 in connection with transactions that were not consummated and ATM Program costs. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased $10.4 million, or 8.5 percent, for 2021 over 2020. This decrease was due primarily to lower depreciation of fully-amortized assets of approximately $13.6 million for the Same-Store Properties for 2021 as compared to 2020 and a decrease of approximately $1.6 million for properties sold or removed from service, partially offset by an increase in depreciation of $4.7 million for 2021 as compared to 2020 from the Acquired and Developed Properties. Property impairments. In 2021, the Company recorded impairment charges of $7.4 million on its held and used hotel properties in Weehawken, New Jersey and $6.0 million on its then held and used office property in Hoboken, New Jersey. In 2020, the Company recorded impairment charges of $36.6 million on its held and used hotel properties in Weehawken, New Jersey. Land and other impairments . In 2021, the Company recorded $20.8 million of impairments on developable land parcels and $2.9 million of goodwill impairment. In 2020, the Company recorded valuation impairment charges of $16.8 million on developable land parcels. Interest expense. Interest expense decreased $15.8 million, or 19.5 percent, for 2021 as compared to 2020. This decrease was primarily the result of lower average debt balances in 2021 as compared to 2020, due to the Company redemption of its Senior Unsecured Notes in 2021, using proceeds from sales of office properties. Interest and other investment income. Interest and other investment income increased $0.5 million for 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to interest received on a note receivable, partially offset by the write-down of a note receivable in 2021. Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $0.4 million, or 11.0 percent, for 2021 as compared to 2020. The decrease is primarily due to an increase in concessions and discounts to tenants in 2021 as compared to 2020 resulting in a reduction of $1.7 million of rental revenue for 2021 as compared to 2020 from a venture located in Jersey City, New Jersey. Realized gains (losses) and unrealized losses on disposition of rental property, net. The Company had realized gains (unrealized losses) on disposition of rental property of $3.0 million in 2021 and $2.7 million in 2020. See Note 3: Recent Transactions Dispositions to the Financial Statements. Gain on disposition of developable land. In 2021, the Company recorded a gain of $2.1 million on the sale of land holdings in Newark and Hamilton, New Jersey. In 2020, the Company recorded a gain of $5.8 million on the sale of land holdings located in Mount Pleasant, New York; Middletown, New Jersey; and Greenbelt, Maryland. See Note 3: Recent Transactions Dispositions to the Financial Statements. Gain on sale from unconsolidated joint ventures. In 2021, the Company recorded a loss of $1.9 million on the sale of its interest in a joint venture which owns an office property in West Orange, New Jersey. In 2020, the Company recorded a $35.2 million gain for its share on the sale the joint venture - owned property in Arlington, Virginia and land in Hillsborough, New Jersey. See Note 4: Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures to the Financial Statements. 42 Table of Contents Loss from extinguishment of debt, net. In 2021, the Company recognized losses from early extinguishment of debt of $47.1 million which consists of $24.2 million in connection with the redemption of the Company Senior Unsecured Notes and $22.6 million in connection with the sale of Short Hills office portfolio and related defeasement of the mortgage loan. In 2020, the Company recorded a loss on early retirement of debt of $0.3 million in connection with the repayment of a construction loan on a multifamily property located in Malden, Massachusetts. Discontinued operations. For all periods presented, the Company classified 36 office properties totaling 6.3 million square feet as discontinued operations, some of which were sold during the periods. The income from these properties decreased $56.8 million for 2021 as compared to 2020, due primarily to the sale of 16 properties in 2021 and 20 properties in 2020. Included within discontinued operations are realized gains (losses) and unrealized losses on disposition of rental property and impairments, net, of a gain of $25.6 million in 2021 and a gain of $14.2 million in 2020. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Overview Rental revenue is the Company principal source of funds to pay its material cash commitments consisting of operating expenses, debt service, capital expenditures and dividends, excluding non-recurring capital expenditures. To the extent that the Company cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to finance its non-recurring capital expenditures such as property acquisitions, development and construction costs and other capital expenditures, the Company has and expects to continue to finance such activities through borrowings under its revolving credit facility, other debt and equity financings, proceeds from the sale of properties and joint venture capital. The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements generally through its working capital, which may include proceeds from the sales of rental properties and land, net cash provided by operating activities and draws from its revolving credit facility. REIT Restrictions To maintain its qualification as a REIT under the IRS Code, the General Partner must make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90 percent of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains. However, any such distributions, whether for federal income tax purposes or otherwise, would be paid out of available cash, including borrowings and other sources, after meeting operating requirements, preferred stock dividends and distributions, and scheduled debt service on the Company debt. If and to the extent the Company retains and does not distribute any net capital gains, the General Partner will be required to pay federal, state and local taxes on such net capital gains at the rate applicable to capital gains of a corporation. The Company has suspended its common dividends since September 2020, which was initially a strategic decision by the Board to allow for greater financial flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic and to retain incremental capital to support the Company value-enhancing investments across the portfolio and was based upon its estimates of taxable income. Based upon its current estimates of taxable income and its expectation of disposition activity, the Board has made the strategic decision to continue to suspend its dividend to support the transformation of the Company to a pure-play multifamily REIT and will re-evaluate this decision when such transition is substantially complete. The declaration and payment of dividends and distributions will continue to be determined by the Board of Directors of the General Partner in light of conditions then existing, including the Company's earnings, cash flows, financial condition, capital requirements, debt maturities, the availability of debt and equity capital, applicable REIT and legal restrictions and general overall economic conditions and other factors. The dividends and distributions payable at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 represent amounts payable on unvested LTIP units. Unencumbered Properties As of December 31, 2022, the Company had one unencumbered property with a carrying value of $14.5 million representing 3.7 percent of the Company total consolidated property count. 43 Table of Contents Cash Flows Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by $3.8 million to $47.6 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $51.5 million at December 31, 2021. This decrease is comprised of the following net cash flow items: (1) $66.5 million provided by operating activities. (2) $220.1 million provided by investing activities, consisting primarily of the following: (a) $7.7 million proceeds from the sale of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures; plus (b) $2.9 million received from repayments of notes receivables; plus (c) $451.9 million received from proceeds from the sales of rental property; minus (d) $51.5 million used for additions to rental property and improvements; minus (e) $73.2 million used for the development of rental property, other related costs and deposits; minus (f) $130.5 million used for rental property acquisitions and related intangibles.

(b) Excludes amortized deferred financing costs primarily pertaining to the Company revolving credit facility which amounted to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans On May 6, 2021, the Company entered into a revolving credit and term loan agreement ( 2021 Credit Agreement ) with a group of seven lenders that provides for a $250 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the 2021 Credit Facility ) and a $150 million senior secured term loan facility (the 2021 Term Loan ), and delivered written notice to the administrative agents to terminate the 2017 credit agreement, which termination became effective May 13, 2021. The terms of the 2021 Credit Facility include: (1) a three-year term ending in May 2024; (2) revolving credit loans may be made to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of up to $250 million (subject to increase as discussed below), with a sublimit under the 2021 Credit Facility for the issuance of letters of credit in an amount not to exceed $50 million; and (3) a first priority lien in unencumbered properties of the Company with an appraised value greater than or equal to $800 million which must include the Company Harborside 2/3 and Harborside 5 properties; and (4) a facility fee payable quarterly equal to 35 basis points if usage of the 2021 Credit Facility is less than or equal to 50%, and 25 basis points if usage of the 2021 Credit Facility is greater than 50%. The terms of the 2021 Term Loan included: (1) an eighteen-month term ending in November 2022; (2) a single draw of the term loan commitments up to an aggregate principal amount of $150 million; and (3) a first priority lien in unencumbered properties of the Company with an appraised value greater than or equal to $800 million which must include the Company Harborside 2/3 and Harborside 5 properties. Interest on borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facility and 2021 Term Loan shall be based on applicable base rate (the Base Rate ) plus a margin ranging from 125 basis points to 275 basis points depending on the Base Rate elected, currently 0.12%. The Base Rate shall be either (A) the highest of (i) the Wall Street Journal prime rate, (ii) the greater of the then effective (x) Federal Funds Effective Rate, or (y) Overnight Bank Funding Rate plus 50 basis points, and (iii) a LIBO Rate, as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities (the Adjusted LIBO Rate ) and calculated for a one-month interest period, plus 100 basis points (such highest amount being the ABR Rate ), or (B) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the applicable interest period; provided, however, that the ABR Rate shall not be less than 1% and the Adjusted LIBO Rate shall not be less than zero. The 2021 Credit Agreement, which applies to both the 2021 Credit Facility and 2021 Term Loan, includes certain restrictions and covenants which limit, among other things the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence of liens and the disposition of real estate properties, and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to the minimum 45 Table of Contents collateral pool value ($800 million), maximum collateral pool leverage ratio (40 percent), minimum number of collateral pool properties (two), the maximum total leverage ratio (65 percent), the minimum debt service coverage ratio (1.10 times until May 6, 2022, 1.20 times from May 7, 2022 through May 6, 2023, and 1.40 times thereafter), and the minimum tangible net worth ratio (80% of tangible net worth as of December 31, 2020 plus 80% of net cash proceeds of equity issuances by the General Partner or the Operating Partnership). The 2021 Credit Agreement contains change of control provisions that permit the lenders to declare a default and require the immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facility. These change of control provisions, which have been an event of default under the agreements governing the Company revolving credit facilities since June 2000, are triggered if, among other things, a majority of the seats on the Board of Directors (other than vacant seats) become occupied by directors who were neither nominated by the Board of Directors, nor appointed by the Board of Directors. If these change of control provisions were triggered, the Company could seek a forbearance, waiver or amendment of the change of control provisions from the lenders, however there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to obtain such forbearance, waiver or amendment on acceptable terms or at all. If an event of default has occurred and is continuing, the entire outstanding balance under the 2021 Credit Agreement may (or, in the case of any bankruptcy event of default, shall) become immediately due and payable, and the Company will not make any excess distributions except to enable the General Partner to continue to qualify as a REIT under the IRS Code. On May 6, 2021, the Company drew the full $150 million available under the 2021 Term Loan and borrowed $145 million from the 2021 Credit Facility to retire the Company Senior Unsecured Notes. In June 2021, the Company paid down a total of $123 million of borrowings under the 2021 Term Loan, using sales proceeds from several of the Company suburban office property dispositions. On July 27, 2021, the Company repaid the outstanding balance of the 2021 Term Loan of $27 million, using proceeds from the disposition of a suburban office property previously held for sale. (See Note 3: Recent Transactions Real Estate Held for Sale/Discontinued Operations/Dispositions). Mortgages, Loans Payable and Other Obligations The Company has other mortgages, loans payable and other obligations which consist of various loans collateralized by certain of the Company rental properties. Payments on mortgages, loans payable and other obligations are generally due in monthly installments of principal and interest, or interest only. Debt Strategy The Company intends to utilize a combination of corporate and property level indebtedness. The Company will seek to refinance or retire its debt obligations at maturity with either available proceeds received from the Company planned non-strategic asset sales, as well as with new corporate or property level indebtedness on or before the applicable maturity dates. If it cannot raise sufficient proceeds to retire the maturing debt, the Company may draw on its revolving credit facility to retire the maturing indebtedness, which would reduce the future availability of funds under such facility. As of February 15, 2023, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $4.0 million under its revolving credit facility. The Company is continually evaluating its financing and refinancing options, including the issuance of additional, or exchange of current, unsecured debt or common and preferred stock, and/or obtaining additional mortgage debt of the Operating Partnership, some or all of which may be completed in 2023. The Company currently anticipates that its available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from the sale of real estate assets and joint ventures investments, together with cash available from borrowings and other sources, will be adequate to meet the Company capital and liquidity needs in the short term. However, if these sources of funds are insufficient or unavailable, due to current economic conditions or otherwise, or if capital needs to fund acquisition and development opportunities in the multifamily rental sector arise, the Company ability to make the expected distributions discussed in REIT Restrictions above may be adversely affected. 46 Table of Contents Equity Financing and Registration Statements Common Equity The following table presents the changes in the General Partner issued and outstanding shares of common stock and the Operating Partnership common units for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The DRIP also permits participants to make optional cash investments up to $5,000 a month without restriction and, if the Company waives this limit, for additional amounts subject to certain restrictions and other conditions set forth in the DRIP prospectus filed as part of the Company effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for the approximately 5.5 million shares of the General Partner common stock reserved for issuance under the DRIP. Shelf Registration Statements The General Partner has an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC for an aggregate amount of $2.0 billion in common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, and/or warrants of the General Partner, under which $200 million of shares of common stock have been allocated for sales pursuant to the Company ATM Program commenced in December 2021 and no securities have been sold as of February 15, 2023. 47 Table of Contents The General Partner and the Operating Partnership also have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC for an aggregate amount of $2.5 billion in common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and guarantees of the General Partner and debt securities of the Operating Partnership, under which no securities have been sold as of February 15, 2023. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Unconsolidated Joint Venture Debt The debt of the Company unconsolidated joint ventures generally provides for recourse to the Company for customary matters such as intentional misuse of funds, environmental conditions and material misrepresentations. The Company has agreed to guarantee repayment of a portion of the debt of its unconsolidated joint ventures. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of such debt totaled $188.5 million of which $22.0 million was guaranteed by the Company. The Company off-balance sheet arrangements are further discussed in Note 4: Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures to the Financial Statements. Funds from Operations Funds from operations ( FFO ) (available to common stock and unit holders) is defined as net income (loss) before noncontrolling interests in Operating Partnership, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from depreciable rental property transactions (including both acquisitions and dispositions), and impairments related to depreciable rental property, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity REIT. The Company further believes that as FFO excludes the effect of depreciation, gains (or losses) from property transactions and impairments related to depreciable rental property (all of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance), FFO can facilitate comparison of operating performance between equity REITs. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income available to common shareholders as an indication of the Company performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. However, the Company FFO is comparable to the FFO of real estate companies that use the current definition of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ). As the Company considers its primary earnings measure, net income available to common shareholders, as defined by GAAP, to be the most comparable earnings measure to FFO, the following table presents a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders to FFO, as calculated in accordance with NAREIT current definition, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 ( in thousands ): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Net income (loss) available to common shareholders $ (52,066) $ (119,042) $ (51,387) Add (deduct): Noncontrolling interests in Operating Partnership (5,202) (15,739) (13,830) Noncontrolling interests in discontinued operations (72) 3,860 8,431 Real estate-related depreciation and amortization on continuing operations (a) 120,584 118,835 131,236 Real estate-related depreciation and amortization on discontinued operations 889 2,555 6,386 Property impairments on continuing operations 94,811 13,467 36,582 Impairment of unconsolidated joint venture investment (included in Equity in earnings) (2) 2,562 Gain on sale from unconsolidated joint ventures (7,677) 1,886 (35,184) Continuing operations: Realized (gains) losses and unrealized (gains) losses on disposition of rental property, net (66,116) (3,022) (2,656) Discontinued operations: Realized (gains) losses and unrealized (gains) losses on disposition of rental property, net 4,440 (25,552) (14,026) Funds from operations available to common stock and Operating Partnership unitholders (b) $ 89,591 $ (22,754) $ 68,114 48 Table of Contents (a) Includes the Company share from unconsolidated joint ventures, and adjustments for noncontrolling interests, of $10.4 million, $10.1 million and $12.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excludes non-real estate-related depreciation and amortization of $1,328, $1,304 and $1,610 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (b) Net income available to common shareholders in 2022, 2021 and 2020 included $9.4 million, $23.7 million and $16.8 million, respectively, of land impairment charges and $94.8 million, $2.1 million and $5.8 million, respectively, from a gain on disposition of developable land, which are included in the calculation to arrive at funds from operations as such gains and charges relate to non-depreciable assets. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risk from its indebtedness primarily from loss resulting from interest rate risk. Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets may affect the spread between the Company yield on invested assets and cost of funds and, in turn, its ability to make distributions or payments to its investors. The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing fixed rate indebtedness or by hedging the majority of its floating rate indebtedness with interest rate swaps or caps, as appropriate. Approximately $1.8 billion of the Company long-term debt as of December 31, 2022 bears interest at fixed rates and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. The effective interest rates on the Company variable rate debt as of December 31, 2022 ranged from LIBOR/SOFR plus 141.0 basis points to LIBOR/SOFR plus 340.0 basis points. Assuming interest-rate swaps and caps are not in effect as of December 31, 2022, if market rates of interest on the Company variable rate debt increased or decreased by 100 basis points, then the increase or decrease in interest costs on the Company variable rate debt would be approximately $1.5 million annually. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's indebtedness with an aggregate principal balance of $1.8 billion had an estimated aggregate fair value of $1.6 billion and if market rates of interest increased or decreased by 100 basis points, the fair value of the Company fixed rate debt as of December 31, 2022 would be approximately $52.6 million higher or lower, respectively. The following table summarizes the principal cash flows (in thousands) based upon maturity dates of the debt obligations and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. December 31, 2022 Debt, including current portion ($s in thousands) 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Sub-total Other (a) Total Fair Value Fixed Rate $ 61,045 $ 610,361 $ 8,384 $ 428,780 $ 313,477 $ 342,441 $ 1,764,488 $ (7,180) $ 1,757,308 $ 1,635,357 Average Interest Rate 3.59 % 5.02 % 3.39 % 4.00 % 3.66 % 3.98 % 4.34 % Variable Rate $ 84,000 $ $ $ 63,000 $ $ $ 147,000 $ (331) $ 146,669 $ 146,669 (a) Adjustment for unamortized debt discount/premium, net, unamortized deferred financing costs, net, and unamortized mark-to-market, net, as of December 31, 2022. While the Company has not experienced any significant credit losses, in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and/or economic downturn, tenant vacancies or defaults could increase and result in losses to the Company which could adversely affect its operating results and liquidity, including its ability to pay its debt obligations.
