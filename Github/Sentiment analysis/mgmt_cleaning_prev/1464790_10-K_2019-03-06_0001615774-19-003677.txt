Riley Financial, Inc. (the Company or B. Riley ) entered into certain agreements pursuant to which B. Riley agreed to provide certain debt and equity funding and other support in connection with the acquisition (the Acquisition ) by Vintage Rodeo Parent, LLC (the Vintage Parent ), of Rent-A-Center, Inc. ( Rent-A-Center ), contemplated by that certain merger agreement dated as of June 17, 2018, by and among Vintage Parent, Vintage Rodeo Acquisition, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of Vintage Parent (the Merger Sub or the Borrower ), and Rent-A-Center (the Merger Agreement ). In connection therewith, B. Riley and Vintage RTO, L.P., an affiliate of Vintage Parent ( Vintage Merger Guarantor ), entered into a Limited Guarantee dated as of June 17, 2018 (the Limited Guarantee ), in favor of Rent-A-Center, pursuant to which B. Riley and Vintage Merger Guarantor (together, the Merger Guarantors ) agreed to guarantee, jointly and severally, to Rent-A-Center the payment, performance and discharge of all of the liabilities and obligations of Vintage Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement when required in accordance with the Merger Agreement (the Guaranteed Obligations ), including without limitation, (i) termination fees in the amount of $126.5 million due to Rent-A-Center if the Merger Agreement is properly terminated (the Termination Fee ); and (ii) reimbursement and indemnification obligations when required (collectively, the Guarantee Obligations ), provided, that the liability under the Limited Guarantee shall not exceed $128.5 million. In connection with the execution of the Limited Guarantee, the Company entered into a Mutual Indemnity/Contribution Agreement, dated as of June 17, 2018 (the Mutual Indemnity Agreement ), with the Vintage Merger Guarantor and Samjor Family, LP (collectively, the Vintage Indemnity Parties ). Under the Mutual Indemnity Agreement, the Vintage Guarantors agreed, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold harmless B. Riley and its affiliates from damages and liabilities arising out of the Guarantee Obligations, other than those caused B. Riley failure to fund under their debt or equity commitments. On December 18, 2018, Rent-A-Center purported to terminate the Merger Agreement because the end date of the agreement was allegedly not extended prior to December 17, 2018 by Vintage Parent. Rent-A-Center delivered notice of such termination to Vintage Parent, and notified Vintage Parent of its obligation under the terms of the Merger Agreement to pay Rent-A-Center the Termination Fee within three business days. On December 18, 2018, Vintage Capital Management, LLC, an affiliate of Vintage Parent ( Vintage Capital ), delivered a letter to Rent-A-Center stating that Rent-A-Center purported termination of the Merger Agreement is invalid, that it believes the Merger Agreement remains in effect. On December 21, 2018, Vintage Capital filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the Court ) challenging Rent-A-Center purported termination of the Merger Agreement and demand for payment of the Termination Fee. The relief sought by Vintage Capital includes declaratory judgements that the Merger Agreement has not been terminated and remains in full force and effect, that Rent-A-Center has breached its obligations under the Merger Agreement and is not excused from failing to comply with its obligations thereunder and that the Termination Fee is an unenforceable penalty. On December 28, 2018, Rent-A-Center provided each of B. Riley and the Vintage Merger Guarantors with a written request under the Limited Guarantee (a Performance Demand ), to promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days, pay to Rent-A-Center the Guaranteed Obligations (including the Termination Fee) in full. On December 30, 2018, B. Riley filed a motion in the Court to intervene in the above referenced case filed by Vintage Capital pursuant to which B. Riley is seeking declaratory judgments, among other things, that the parties agreed to extend the End Date under the Merger Agreement and that Rent-A-Center is estopped from terminating the Merger Agreement, that Rent-A-Center has breached the Merger Agreement and its obligations of good faith and fair dealing in connection with consummating the Merger, and that the Termination Fee is an unenforceable penalty. B. Riley is also seeking an award of costs and reasonable attorneys fees and such other further relief as the Court finds equitable and appropriate. At a hearing held on December 31, 2018, the Court stated that it would grant a temporary restraining order to preserve the status quo, which order would prohibit Rent-A-Center from engaging in certain transactions pending an expedited trial on the merits. On January 3, 2019, the Court granted B. Riley motion to intervene in the Vintage Capital case and on January 7, 2019, the Court granted a temporary restraining order restricting Rent-A-Center from engaging in certain transactions prior to the trial on the merits scheduled for February 11, 2019. On February 11th and 12th, a trial was held in Delaware, post-trial briefs were filed on February 22, 2019 and March 1, 2019. A post-trial hearing has been scheduled for March 11, 2019. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the Court will rule in favor of the Performance Demand. The amount of possible loss is not estimable; however, the range of loss could be from $0 to $128.5 million. 59 On November 14, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire shares of National Holdings Corporation ( National Holdings ), a Nasdaq-listed issuer, from Fortress Biotech, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price totaling approximately $22.9 million.

The borrowings under the BRPAC Credit Agreement bear interest equal to the LIBOR plus a margin of 2.50% to 3.00% depending on the Borrowers consolidated total funded debt ratio as defined in the BRPAC Credit Agreement. The proceeds of the BRPAC Credit Agreement were used to refinance a portion of the purchase price of the recently closed acquisition of magicJack and to pay related costs. Borrowings under the BRPAC Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to (A) the LIBOR Rate for Eurodollar loans, plus (B) the applicable margin rate, which ranges from two and one-half percent (2.5%) to three percent (3.0%) per annum.

Pursuant to the Agency Agreement, the Joint Venture agreed to pay (a) a cash purchase price of approximately $560.0 million (the Cash Purchase Price ), which includes all amounts due and owing by the Debtors to the lenders under that certain debtor in possession financing facility, the cash amounts used to collateralize certain letters of credit and an amount to fund the payment of certain fees and expenses incurred by the Debtors professionals, (b) a credit bid of $125.0 million, and (c) $93.8 million to pay for certain administrative expenses of the Debtors as reflected in an agreed upon wind down budget. In exchange for such payments and the payment of certain expenses, the Joint Venture received the right to receive all proceeds (cash or otherwise) of any of the Debtors' Assets except as otherwise set forth in the Agency Agreement (the Proceeds ). The sale of inventory and certain of the assets of Bon-Ton through a going-out-of-business sale was completed on August 31, 2018. The Joint Venture continues to wind down the business activities of Bon-Ton and sale of certain real property, among other items, in accordance with the Agency Agreement. To fund GA portion of the Cash Purchase Price, GA borrowed (i) $300.0 million from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.

Total revenues increased $100.8 million to $423.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 from $322.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from services and fees of $85.7 million, an increase in revenue from interest income securities lending of $14.8 million and increase in revenue from sale of goods of $0.3 million. The increase in revenue from services and fees of $85.7 million in 2018 was primarily due to an increase in revenue of $70.6 million in the Capital Markets segment, $7.5 million in the Auction and Liquidation segment, $5.4 million in the Valuation and Appraisal segment and $2.2 million in the Principal Investments United Online and magicJack segment. Revenues from services and fees in the Capital Markets segment increased $70.6 million, or 40.9% to $243.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 from $172.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in revenue of $25.4 million from investment banking fees, an increase in revenue of $33.9 million from wealth management services, an increase in revenue of $12.8 million from consulting fees as a result of the acquisition of GlassRatner on August 1, 2018, an increase of $13.5 million from commissions and fees revenue from research, sales and trading and an increase of $8.1 million of other revenues, offset by a decrease in revenues of $23.1 million from trading gains. Included in the revenue from the Capital Markets segment during the year ended December 31, 2018 is full year revenue of FBR and Wunderlich, which the company acquired on June 1, 2017 and July 2, 2017, respectively. Revenues from services and fees in the Auction and Liquidation segment increased $7.5 million, or 15.9%, to $54.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 from $47.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in revenues of $7.5 million was primarily due to an increase in revenues of $5.8 million from services and fees from retail liquidation engagements and an increase in revenues of $1.7 million from services and fees in our wholesale and industrial auction division. Revenues from services and fees in the Valuation and Appraisal segment increased $5.4 million, or 16.1%, to $38.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 from $33.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in revenues was primarily due to $3.9 million increase related to appraisal engagements where we perform valuations for the monitoring of collateral for financial institutions, lenders, and private equity investors, $1.3 million increase related to appraisal engagements where we perform valuations of intellectual property and business valuations, and $0.2 million increase related to appraisal engagements where we perform valuations of machinery and equipment. Revenues from services and fees in the Principal Investments - United Online and magicJack segment increased $2.2 million to $53.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 from $51.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Revenues from services and fees as a result of the acquisition of magicJack included in the segment for the period from November 14, 2018 (acquisition date) through December 31, 2018 were $8.8 million. UOL services revenues primarily from customer paid accounts related to our Internet access and related subscription services decreased approximately $3.8 million to $35.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 from $39.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Advertising revenues from Internet display advertising and search related to our email and Internet access services decreased $2.7 million to $9.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 from $12.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Over the past several years revenues from UOL paid subscription services have declined year over year as a result of a decline in the number of paid subscribers for our services. Management believes the decline in UOL paid subscriber accounts is primarily attributable to the industry trends of consumers switching from dial-up Internet access to high speed Internet access such as cable and DSL.

The increase in revenues was due to an increase in revenues of $66.1 million from investment banking, $33.1 million from wealth management, $29.2 million from sales commissions, fees and other, and $5.0 million from trading income. The increase in revenues from investment banking fees was primarily due to an increase in the number of investment banking transactions where we acted as an advisor in 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. Of the $66.1 million increase from investment banking fees, $50.9 million was due to operations of FBR that we acquired on June 1, 2017.

The decrease in revenues of $14.5 million was primarily due to a decrease in revenues of $11.2 million from services and fees from retail liquidation engagements, and $3.3 million decrease in revenues in our wholesale and industrial auction division. The decrease in revenues from services and fees was primarily due to the completion of two large retail liquidation engagements in 2016 where we guaranteed the recovery value of inventory and generated more revenues as compared to the larger mix of fee and commission type of retail liquidation engagements we completed in 2017. The decrease in revenues from services and fees in our wholesale and industrial division was primarily due to a decrease in the number of wholesale and industrial auction engagements in 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. Revenues from services and fees in the Valuation and Appraisal segment increased $1.6 million, or 5%, to $33.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 from $31.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.

Advertising revenues from Internet display advertising and search related to our email and Internet access services were $12.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 and $8.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Over the past several years revenues from paid subscription services have declined year over year as a result of a decline in the number of paid subscribers for our services. Management believes the decline in paid subscriber accounts is primarily attributable to the industry trends of consumers switching from dial-up Internet access to high speed Internet access such as cable and DSL. Management expects revenues in the Principal Investments - United Online segment to continue to decline year over year.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of (a) $22.8 of net proceeds from our secondary offering of common stock in May 2016 and (b) $27.7 million of net proceeds from the issuance of our Senior Notes in November 2016, offset by cash used in financing activities of (a) $5.3 million of dividends paid on our common stock, (b) $2.0 million of distributions to noncontrolling interests, (c) $1.2 million of cash used to pay employment taxes on the vesting of restricted stock, and (d) $1.6 million of cash used for the repayment of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and contingent consideration payable. Credit Agreements On April 21, 2017, we amended the Credit Agreement governing our asset based credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank to increase the maximum borrowing limit from $100.0 million to $200.0 million. Such amendment, among other things, also extended the expiration date of the credit facility from July 15, 2018 to April 21, 2022. On April 19, 2018, the Company entered into an amended and restated consent to the Credit Agreement, pursuant to which Wells Fargo Bank increased the maximum borrowing limit solely for the purposes of the Bon-Ton Transactions from $200.0 million to $300.0 million and reverted back to $200.0 million upon repayment of the amounts borrowed in connection with the Bon-Ton Transactions. The amounts borrowed in connection with the Bon Ton Transaction were fully repaid in the third quarter of 2018 and the maximum borrowing limit under the Credit Agreement reverted back to $200.0 million. The Credit Agreement continues to allow for borrowings under the separate credit agreement (a UK Credit Agreement ) which was dated March 19, 2015 with an affiliate of Wells Fargo Bank which provides for the financing of transactions in the United Kingdom with borrowings up to 50.0 million British Pounds. Any borrowing on the UK Credit Agreement reduce the availability of the asset based $300.0 million credit facility. The UK Credit Agreement is cross collateralized and integrated in certain respects with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement continues to include the addition of our Canadian subsidiary, from the October 5, 2016 amendment to the Credit Agreement, to facilitate borrowings to fund retail liquidation transactions in Canada. From time to time, we utilize this credit facility to fund costs and expenses incurred in connection with liquidation engagements. We also utilize this credit facility in order to issue letters of credit in connection with liquidation engagements conducted on a guaranteed basis. Subject to certain limitations and offsets, we are permitted to borrow up to $200.0 million under the credit facility, less the aggregate principal amount borrowed under the UK Credit Agreement (if in effect). Borrowings under the credit facility are only made at the discretion of the lender and are generally required to be repaid within 180 days. The interest rate for each revolving credit advance under the related credit agreement is, subject to certain terms and conditions, equal to the LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% to 3.25% depending on the type of advance and the percentage such advance represents of the related transaction for which such advance is provided. The credit facility is secured by the proceeds received for services rendered in connection with the liquidation service contracts pursuant to which any outstanding loan or letters of credit are issued and the assets that are sold at liquidation related to such contract, if any. The credit facility also provides for success fees in the amount of 2.5% to 17.5% of the net profits, if any, earned on liquidation engagements that are financed under the credit facility as set forth in the related credit agreement. We typically seek borrowings on an engagement-by- engagement basis. The credit agreement governing the credit facility contains certain covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets, make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. At December 31, 2018, there were no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility. 75 On December 19, 2018, BRPI Acquisition Co LLC ( BRPAC ), a Delaware corporation, UOL, and YMAX Corporation, a Delaware corporation (collectively, the Borrowers ), indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, in the capacity of borrowers, entered into a credit agreement with the Banc of California, N.A. in the capacity as agent and lender and with the other lenders party thereto (the BRPAC Credit Agreement ). Under the BRPAC Credit Agreement, we borrowed $80.0 million due December 19, 2023. Pursuant to the terms of the BRPAC Credit Agreement, we may request additional optional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $10.0 million at any time prior to the first anniversary of the agreement date. On February 1, 2019, the Borrowers entered into the First Amendment to Credit Agreement and Joinder with City National Bank as a new lender in which the new lender extended to Borrowers the additional $10.0 million as further discussed in Note 11 to the accompanying financial statements. Borrowings under the BRPAC Credit Agreement are due in quarterly installments commencing on March 31, 2020 with any remaining amounts outstanding due at maturity. The borrowings under the BRPAC Credit Agreement bear interest equal to the LIBOR plus a margin of 2.50% to 3.00% depending on the Borrowers consolidated total funded debt ratio as defined in the BRPAC Credit Agreement.

The outstanding balance of the 6.875% 2023 Notes was $98.6 million (net of unamortized debt issue costs and premium of $1.4 million) at December 31, 2018. During 2017 and 2018, we entered into a series of related At the Market Issuance Sales Agreements (the Sales Agreements ) with B. Riley FBR, Inc. governing an ongoing program of at-the-market sales of our senior notes. We filed prospectus supplements under which we sold the senior notes on June 28, 2017, December 19, 2017, April 25, 2018, June 5, 2018 and December 18, 2018. Each of these prospectus supplements was filed pursuant to an effective Registration Statement on Form S-3. In aggregate, we have sold senior notes having an aggregate principal balance of $467.2 million under the Sales Agreements and related prospectus supplements. Our most recent Sales Agreement was entered into on December 18, 2018 (the December 2018 Program ), and, under the related prospectus supplement, we may offer and sell up to $75.0 million of the senior notes. As of December 31, 2018, we had $75.0 million remaining availability under the December 2018 Program. 76 Other Borrowings Notes payable include notes payable to a clearing organization for one of our broker dealers. The notes payable accrue interest at rates set at each anniversary date, ranging from prime rate plus 0.25% to 2.0% (5.25% to 6.50% at December 31, 2018). Interest is payable annually. The principal payments on the notes payable are due annually in the amount of $0.4 million on January 31, $0.2 million on September 30, and $0.1 million on October 31. The notes payable mature at various dates from September 30, 2018 through January 31, 2022. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the outstanding balance for the notes payable was $1.6 million and $2.2 million, respectively. On April 19, 2018, we borrowed approximately $51.0 million from GACP II, L.P., a direct lending fund managed by Great American Capital Partners, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In accordance with the note payable, we were advanced $50.0 million and the note payable included an origination fee of $1.0 million that increased the face value of the note payable to $51.0 million. Interest accrued at the three-month LIBOR rate plus 9%. The note payable was due in September 2018 and was fully repaid in August 2018. The note was collateralized by the proceeds generated from the joint venture liquidation of inventory and real estate related to a retail liquidation agreement. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2018, we had an off-balance sheet guarantee, the Limited Guarantee, which was entered into on June 17, 2018 as part of Vintage Parent acquisition of Rent-A-Center as more fully described in Recent Developments included in Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In connection therewith, B. Riley and Vintage Merger Guarantor agreed to guarantee, jointly and severally, to Rent-A-Center the payment, performance and discharge of all of the liabilities and obligations of Vintage Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement when required in accordance with the Merger Agreement, including without limitation, (i) termination fees in the amount of $126.5 million due to Rent-A-Center if the Merger Agreement is properly terminated; and (ii) reimbursement and indemnification obligations when required, provided, that the liability under the Limited Guarantee shall not exceed $128.5 million. In connection with the execution of the Limited Guarantee, the Company entered into a Mutual Indemnity Agreement, dated as of June 17, 2018, with the Vintage Indemnity Parties. Under the Mutual Indemnity Agreement, the Vintage Guarantors agreed, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold harmless B. Riley and its affiliates from damages and liabilities arising out of the Guarantee Obligations, other than those caused B. Riley failure to fund under their debt or equity commitments. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for addition discussion of the Limited Guarantee. We have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements and do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities or entered into any options on non-financial assets. 77 Dividends From time to time, we may decide to pay dividends which will be dependent upon our financial condition and results of operations. On March 5, 2019 the Company declared a regular dividend of $0.08 per share which will be paid by the Company on or about March 28, 2019 to stockholders of record as of March 19, 2019. On November 5, 2018, the Company declared a regular dividend of $0.08 per share and a special dividend of $0.08 per share which was paid by the Company on November 27, 2018 to stockholders of record as of November 16, 2018. On August 2, 2018, the Company declared a regular dividend of $0.08 per share and a special dividend of $0.22 per share which was paid by the Company on August 29, 2018 to stockholders of record as of August 16, 2018. On May 7, 2018, the Company declared a regular dividend of $0.08 per share and a special dividend of $0.04 per share which was paid by the Company on June 5, 2018 to stockholders of record as of May 21, 2018. On March 7, 2018, the Company declared a regular dividend of $0.08 per share and a special dividend of $0.08 per share which was paid by the Company on April 3, 2018. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we paid cash dividends of $22.7 million and $16.8 million on our common stock, respectively. While it is the Board current intention to make regular dividend payments of $0.08 per share each quarter and special dividend payments dependent upon exceptional circumstances from time to time, our Board of Directors may reduce or discontinue the payment of dividends at any time for any reason it deems relevant. The declaration and payment of any future dividends or repurchases of our common stock will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, capital expenditures, and other factors that may be deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 and the periods in which payments are due: Payments due by period Less Than More Than Total One Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years 5 years (Dollars in thousands) Contractual Obligations Operating lease obligations $ 85,163 $ 12,607 $ 21,572 $ 18,058 $ 32,926 Notes payable 1,719 561 799 359 Term loan 90,733 21,627 40,967 28,139 Senior notes payable, including interest 680,286 34,026 113,884 266,150 266,226 Total $ 857,901 $ 68,821 $ 177,222 $ 312,706 $ 299,152 We anticipate that cash generated from operations and existing borrowing arrangements under our credit facility to fund costs and expenses incurred in connection with liquidation engagements should be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the success of our businesses in generating cash from operations, continued compliance with financial covenants contained in our credit facility, the timing of principal payments on our long-term debt and the Capital Markets in general, among other factors. Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements and the notes thereto contain information that is pertinent to management discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. On a continual basis, management reviews its estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such reviews, and if deemed appropriate, management estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different and/or future circumstances. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and changes in the estimate, or the use of different estimating methods that could have been selected, could have a material impact on results of operations or financial condition. 78 Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as valuation of securities, reserves for accounts receivable, the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill, the fair value of mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests and accounting for income tax valuation allowances. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements. Revenue Recognition. On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method and the impact was determined to be immaterial on our consolidated financial statements. The new revenue standard was applied prospectively in our consolidated financial statements from January 1, 2018 forward and reported financial information for historical comparable periods will not be revised and will continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect during those historical periods. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or performance obligations for services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services. Revenues from contracts with customers in the Capital Markets segment, Auction and Liquidation segment, Valuation and Appraisal segment, and Principal Investments United Online and magicJack segment are primarily comprised of the following: Capital Markets Segment - Fees earned from corporate finance and investment banking services are derived from debt, equity and convertible securities offerings in which the Company acted as an underwriter or placement agent. Fees from underwriting activities are recognized as revenues when the performance obligation for the services related to the underwriting transaction is satisfied under the terms of the engagement and is not subject to any other contingencies. Fees are also earned from financial advisory and consulting services rendered in connection with client mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, recapitalizations and other strategic transactions. The performance obligation for financial advisory services is satisfied over time as work progresses on the engagement and services are delivered to the client. The performance obligation for financial advisory services may also include success and performance based fees which are recognized as revenue when the performance obligation is no longer constrained and it is not probable that the revenue recognized would be subject to significant reversal in a future period. Generally, it is probable that the revenue recognized is no longer subject to significant reversal upon the closing of the investment banking transaction. Fees from wealth and asset management services consist primarily of investment management fees that are recognized over the period the performance obligation for the services are provided. Investment management fees are primarily comprised of fees for investment management services and are generally based on the dollar amount of the assets being managed. Revenues from sales and trading are recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied and include commissions resulting from equity securities transactions executed as agent or principal and are recorded on a trade date basis and fees paid for equity research. Revenues from other sources in the Capital Markets segment is primarily comprised of (i) interest income from loans receivable and securities lending activities, (ii) related net trading gains and losses from market making activities, the commitment of capital to facilitate customer orders, (iii) trading activities from our Principal Investments in equity and other securities for the Company account, and (iv) other income. Interest income from securities lending activities consists of interest income from equity and fixed income securities that are borrowed from one party and loaned to another. The Company maintains relationships with a broad group of banks and broker-dealers to facilitate the sourcing, borrowing and lending of equity and fixed income securities in a matched book to limit the Company exposure to fluctuations in the market value or securities borrowed and securities loaned. Other revenues include (i) net trading gains and losses from market making activities in our fixed income group, (ii) carried interest from our asset management recognized as earnings from financial assets within the scope of ASC 323 - Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures , and therefore will not be in the scope of ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers . In accordance with ASC 323 - Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures , the Company will record equity method income (losses) as a component of investment income based on the change in our proportionate claim on net assets of the investment fund, including performance-based capital allocations, assuming the investment fund was liquidated as of each reporting date pursuant to each fund's governing agreements, and (iii) other miscellaneous income. 79 Auction and Liquidation segment - Commission and fees earned on the sale of goods at Auction and Liquidation sales are recognized when evidence of a contract or arrangement exists, the transaction price has been determined, and the performance obligation has been satisfied when control of the product and risks of ownership has been transferred to the buyer. The commission and fees earned for these services are included in revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Under these types of arrangements, revenues also include contractual reimbursable costs. Revenues earned from Auction and Liquidation services contracts where the Company guarantees a minimum recovery value for goods being sold at auction or liquidation are recognized over time when the performance obligation is satisfied. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of services to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Costs to fulfill the contract include labor and other direct costs related to the contract. Due to the nature of the guarantees and performance obligations under these contracts, the estimation of revenue that is ultimately earned is complex and subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. It is common for these contracts to contain provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price upon completion of our performance obligations under the contract. Estimated amounts are included in the transaction price at the most likely amount it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether or not to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance under the contract taking into consideration all historical, current and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us. Costs that directly relate to the contract and expected to be recoverable are capitalized as an asset and included in advances against customer contracts in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These costs are amortized as the services are transferred to the customer over the contract period, which generally does not exceed six months, and the expense is recognized as a component of direct cost of services. If, during the auction or liquidation sale, the Company determines that the total costs to be incurred on a performance obligation under a contract exceeds the total estimated revenues to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the performance obligation is recognized in the period the loss is determined. Valuation and Appraisal Segment - Revenues in the Valuation and Appraisal segment are primarily comprised of fees for Valuation and Appraisal services. Revenues are recognized when the performance obligation is completed and is generally at the point in time upon delivery of the report to the customer. Revenues in the Valuation and Appraisal segment also include contractual reimbursable costs. Principal Investments United Online and magicJack Segment Revenues in the Principal Investments - United Online and magicJack segment are primarily comprised of services revenue from fees charged to United Online pay accounts; sales revenue from the sale of the magicJack and related devices and access rights; revenues from access rights renewals and mobile apps; prepaid minutes revenues; revenues from access and wholesale charges; service revenue from Unified Communication as a Service ( UCaaS ) hosting services; advertising and other revenues; and products revenues from the sale of magicJack and mobile broadband service devices, including the related shipping and handling and installation fees, if applicable. Service revenues from fees charged to United Online pay accounts are recognized in the period in which fees are fixed or determinable and the related services are provided to the customer. The Company pay accounts generally pay in advance for their services by credit card, PayPal, automated clearinghouse or check, and revenues are then recognized ratably over the service period. Advance payments from pay accounts are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue. In circumstances where payment is not received in advance, revenues are only recognized if collectability is probably. Revenues from sales of the magicJack devices and access rights represent revenues recognized from sales of the magicJack devices to retailers, wholesalers, or direct to customers, net of returns. Prior to the adoption of ASC 606 revenues for the device and initial access right were accounted for as a combined unit of accounting and recognized ratably over the service term. With the adoption of ASC 606, the transaction price for magicJack devices is allocated between equipment and service based on stand-alone selling prices. Revenues allocated to equipment are recognized when control transfers to the customer, and service revenue is recognized ratably over the service term. The Company estimates the return of direct sales as part of the transaction price using a six month rolling average of historical returns. Revenues for hardware and shipping are recognized at the time of delivery and revenues for services are recognized ratably over the service. The Company recognizes revenue for hardware based on delivery terms to the retailer and revenue for service is deferred for the delay period and recognized ratably over the remaining access right period. Revenues from access rights renewals and mobile apps represents revenues from customers purchasing rights to access our servers beyond the access right period included in a magicJack device or magicJack service. The extended access right ranges from one to five years. These fees charged to customers are initially deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the extended access right period. Revenues from access rights granted to users of the magicApp, magicJack Connect App and magicJack for Business are recognized ratably over the access right period. 80 Revenues from the sale of other magicJack related products are revenues recognized from the sale of other items related to the magicJack devices and access right renewals the Company offers its customers, including porting fees charged to customers to port their existing phone number to a magicJack device or services, fees charged for customer to select a custom, vanity or Canadian phone number and fees charged to customers to change their existing number. These revenues are recognized at the time of sale. Prepaid minutes revenues are primarily from the usage and expiration of international prepaid minutes, net of chargebacks. Revenues from prepaid minutes are recognized as minutes are used. Revenues from access and wholesale charges are generated from access fees charged to other telecommunication carriers or providers for Interexchange Carriers ( IXC ) calls terminated to the Company end-users, and other fees charged to telecommunication carriers or providers for origination of calls to their 800-numbers. These revenues are recorded based on rates set forth in the respective state and federal tariffs or negotiated contract rates, less provisions for billing adjustments. Revenues from access and wholesale charges are recognized as calls are terminated to the network. UCaaS revenues are recurring monthly service revenue from sales of its hosted services. Customers are billed monthly in advance for these recurring services and in arrears for one time service charges and other certain usage charges. UCaas revenues also includes non-recurring revenue from the sale of hardware and network equipment. Revenues for recurring monthly service are recorded in the period the services are provided over the term of the respective customer agreements and revenue from the sale of hardware and network equipment is recognized in the period that the equipment is delivered. Advertising revenues consist primarily of amounts from the Company Internet search partner that are generated as a result of users utilizing the partner Internet search services and amounts generated from display advertisements. The Company recognizes such advertising revenues in the period in which the advertisement is displayed or, for performance-based arrangements, when the related performance criteria are met. In determining whether an arrangement exists, the Company ensures that a written contract is in place, such as a standard insertion order or a customer-specific agreement. The Company assesses whether performance criteria have been met and whether the fees are fixed or determinable based on a reconciliation of the performance criteria and the payment terms associated with the transaction. The reconciliation of the performance criteria generally includes a comparison of customer-provided performance data to the contractual performance obligation and to internal or third-party performance data in circumstances where that data is available. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses inherent in our accounts receivable portfolio. In establishing the required allowance, management utilizes a specific customer identification methodology. Management also considers historical losses adjusted for current market conditions and the customers financial condition, the amount of receivables in dispute, and the current receivables aging and current payment patterns. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The bad debt expense is included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance which requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. Goodwill includes the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combinations and the acquisition of noncontrolling interests. The Codification requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment). Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value. The Company operates four reporting units, which are the same as its reporting segments described in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of reporting units which includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may assess qualitative factors for some or all of our reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Alternatively, we may bypass this qualitative assessment for some or all of our reporting units and perform a detailed quantitative test of impairment (step 1). If we perform the detailed qualitative impairment test and the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would perform an analysis (step 2) to measure such impairment. In 2018, we performed a qualitative assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill balances for each of our reporting units in performing our annual impairment test and concluded that the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and no impairments were identified. 81 In accordance with the Codification, the Company reviews the carrying value of its intangibles, which is comprised of tradenames and customer lists, and other long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows of such assets are less than the carrying amount, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, if any, exceeds its fair market value. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized impairment of intangibles in the amount of $1.1 million related to the tradename of Wunderlich Securities, Inc. In June 2018, the Company changed the name Wunderlich Securities, Inc. to B. Riley Wealth Management, Inc. This impairment charge is included in restructuring charge in our consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements. The Company records securities and other investments owned, securities sold not yet purchased, and mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests that were issued after November 5, 2003 at fair value with fair value determined in accordance with the Codification. Our mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the three levels of fair value hierarchy. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments that are highly liquid, observable and actively traded in over-the-counter markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable and can be corroborated by market data. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The fair value of mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests is determined based on the issuance of similar interests for cash, references to industry comparables, and relied, in part, on information obtained from appraisal reports and internal valuation models. Investments in partnership interests include investments in private equity partnerships that primarily invest in equity securities, bonds, and direct lending funds. We also invest in priority investment funds and the underlying securities held by these funds are primarily corporate and asset-backed fixed income securities and restrictions exist on the redemption of amounts invested by the Company. The Company partnership and investment fund interests are valued based on the Company proportionate share of the net assets of the partnerships and funds; the value for these investments are derived from the most recent statements received from the general partner or fund administrator. These partnership and investment fund interests are valued at net asset value ( NAV ) in accordance with ASC Topic 820: Fair Value Measurements . The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, loans receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate fair value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amounts of the notes payable (including credit lines used to finance liquidation engagements), long-term debt and capital lease obligations approximate fair value because the contractual interest rates or effective yields of such instruments are consistent with current market rates of interest for instruments of comparable credit risk. The adoption of the new accounting guidance on fair value did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Share-Based Compensation. The Company share based payment awards principally consist of grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units. Share based payment awards also include grants of membership interests in the Company majority owned subsidiaries. The grants of membership interests consist of percentage interests in the Company majority owned subsidiaries as determined at the date of grant. In accordance with the accounting guidance share based payment awards are classified as either equity or a liability. For equity-classified awards, the Company measures compensation cost for the grant of membership interests at fair value on the date of grant and recognizes compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service or performance period the award is expected to vest. The fair value of the liability-classified award will be subsequently remeasured at each reporting date through the settlement date. Change in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period. In June 2018, the Company adopted the 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( Purchase Plan ) which allows eligible employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions as a price that is 15% of the market value of the common stock on the last day of the offering period. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ( ASC 718 ), the Company is required to recognize compensation expense relating to shares offered under the Purchase Plan. 82 Income Taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company estimates the degree to which tax assets and credit carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, the eligible carryforward period, and other circumstances. A valuation allowance for such tax assets and loss carryforwards is provided when it is determined to be more likely than not that the benefit of such deferred tax asset will not be realized in future periods. Tax benefits of operating loss carryforwards are evaluated on an ongoing basis, including a review of historical and projected future operating results, the eligible carryforward period, and other circumstances. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, the related valuation allowance on such assets would be reduced. The Company establishes a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Tax benefits of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are evaluated on an ongoing basis, including a review of historical and projected future operating results, the eligible carryforward period, and other circumstances. As a result of the common stock offering that was completed on June 5, 2014, the Company had a more than 50% ownership shift in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Accordingly, the Company is limited to the amount of net operating loss that may be utilized in future taxable years depending on the Company actual taxable income. As of December 31, 2018, the Company believes that the net operating loss that existed as of the more than 50% ownership shift will be utilized in future tax periods and it is more-likely-than-not that future taxable earnings will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets and has not provided an allowance. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, providing an exemption from U.S. federal tax for dividends received from foreign subsidiaries, and creating new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. We recorded a provisional tax expense of $13,052, related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the corporate income tax rate and tax expense related to non-U.S. activities resulting from the Tax Act. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed its accounting for the provisional amounts recognized at December 31, 2017 and the impact was not significant. See Note 15 to the accompanying financial statements for additional information. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2018-13: Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) ( ASU 2018-13 ). The amendments in this update change the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying and adding certain disclosures. The Company early adopted ASU 2018-13 in the third quarter of 2018 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05: Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. The amendments in this update provide guidance on when to record and disclose provisional amounts for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. The amendments also require any provisional amounts or subsequent adjustments to be included in net income from continuing operations. This ASU also discusses required disclosures that an entity must make with regard to the Tax Reform Act. This ASU is effective immediately as new information is available to adjust provisional amounts that were previously recorded. The Company has adopted this standard and will continue to evaluate indicators that may give rise to a change in our tax provision as a result of the Tax Reform Act. See Note 15 to the accompanying financial statements for additional information on the Tax Reform Act. In February 2016, FASB issued ASU. 2016-02: Leases (Topic 842) which requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months and provide enhanced disclosures. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective method and will not restate comparative periods. We expect to elect the package of practical expedients, which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. While we continue to assess all of the effects of adoption, we currently believe the most significant effects relate to (1) the recognition of new ROU assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for our real estate operating leases; and (2) providing significant new disclosures about our leasing activities. On adoption, we currently expect to recognize lease liabilities of approximately $67,535 with corresponding ROU assets of the same amount based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments under current leasing standards for existing operating leases. We are substantially complete with our implementation efforts. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income that provides for the reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded effects resulting from the Tax Reform Act. The accounting update is effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The accounting update should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Reform Act is recognized. We are currently evaluating the impact of the accounting update, but the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 83 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15 ), which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019, but early application is permitted. We have not yet adopted this update and is currently evaluating the impact it may have on our financial condition and results of operations. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . This standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment. The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The revised guidance will be applied prospectively and is effective for calendar year-end SEC filers for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We have not yet adopted this update and currently evaluating the effect this new standard will have on our financial condition and results of operations On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-18 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash ( ASU 2016-18 ) using the retrospective method which requires adjustment to prior periods in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 clarifies how restricted cash should be presented on the statement of cash flows and requires companies to include restricted cash with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning of period and end of period totals on the statement of cash flows. Restricted cash previously classified under investing activities is now included in the reconciliation of beginning and ending cash on the statement of cash flows. The adoption of ASU 2016-18 did not have a material impact on the our financial condition and results of operations. On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method and the impact was determined to be immaterial on our consolidated financial statements. The new revenue standard was applied prospectively in our consolidated financial statements from January 1, 2018 forward and reported financial information for historical comparable periods will not be revised and will continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect during those historical periods. See Note 13 to the accompanying financial statements for additional information on the adoption of this standard. 84
