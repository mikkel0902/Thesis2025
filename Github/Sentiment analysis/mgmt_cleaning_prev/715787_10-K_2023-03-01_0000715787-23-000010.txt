ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Our revenues are derived from sales of floorcovering products, primarily modular carpet, luxury vinyl tile ( LVT ) and rubber flooring products. Our business, as well as the commercial interiors industry in general, is cyclical in nature and is impacted by economic conditions and trends that affect the markets for commercial and institutional business space. The commercial interiors industry, including the market for floorcovering products, is largely driven by reinvestment by corporations into their existing businesses in the form of new fixtures and furnishings for their workplaces. In significant part, the timing and amount of such reinvestments are impacted by the profitability of those corporations. As a result, macroeconomic factors such as employment rates, office vacancy rates, work from home policies, capital spending, productivity and efficiency gains that impact corporate profitability in general, also affect our business. During fiscal year 2021, the Company largely completed its integration of the nora acquisition, and integration of its European and Asia-Pacific commercial areas, and determined that it has two operating and reportable segments namely Americas ( AMS ) and Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia (collectively EAAA ). The AMS operating segment continues to include the United States, Canada and Latin America geographic areas. See Note 20 entitled Segment Information included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information . The results of operations discussion below also includes segment information. We focus our marketing and sales efforts on both corporate office and non-corporate office market segments, to reduce somewhat our exposure to economic cycles that affect the corporate office market segment more adversely, as well as to capture additional market share. More than half of our consolidated net sales were in non-corporate office markets in fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2021, primarily in education, healthcare, retail, public buildings, hospitality and residential/living market segments. See Item 1, entitled Business, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our mix of sales in corporate office verses non-corporate office market segments for the last three fiscal years by reportable segment. Executive Summary During 2022, we had consolidated net sales of $1,297.9 million, up 8.1% compared to $1,200.4 million in 2021, primarily due to higher sales in the corporate office, education and retail market segments. Consolidated operating income for 2022 was $75.4 million compared to consolidated operating income of $104.8 million in 2021 primarily due to continuing inflationary pressures on raw materials and freight costs in the current year and a $36.2 million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in 2022. Consolidated net income for 2022 was $19.6 million or $0.33 per share, compared to consolidated net income of $55.2 million, or $0.94 per share, in 2021. During 2021, we had consolidated net sales of $1,200.4 million, up 8.8% compared to $1,103.3 million in 2020, primarily due to the rebound in economic activity in certain countries following the impacts of COVID-19. Consolidated operating income for 2021 was $104.8 million compared to consolidated operating loss of $39.3 million in 2020 primarily due to higher sales in 2021 and a $121.3 million impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets in 2020 . Fiscal year 2021 also included $3.9 million of restructuring charges in connection with the planned closure of our Thailand manufacturing operations which occurred in 2022. Consolidated net income for 2021 was $55.2 million or $0.94 per share, compared to consolidated net loss of $71.9 million, or $1.23 per share, in 2020. A detailed discussion of our 2022 and 2021 consolidated and segment performance appears below under Analysis of Results of Operations . Cybersecurity Event As previously disclosed in our current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 23, 2022, we discovered a cybersecurity attack, perpetrated by unauthorized third parties, affecting our IT systems on November 20, 2022. Promptly, out of an abundance of caution, we shut down certain systems including shipping, inventory management and production systems and engaged forensic experts to evaluate the extent of the Cyber Event and its impact to our operations. We took steps to supplement existing security monitoring, including scanning and protective measures, and notified law enforcement. 26 Ta b le of Contents The Company substantially resumed its operations within two weeks following the occurrence of the Cyber Event. However, the investigation of the Cyber Event by our forensic experts is still ongoing. We estimate the Cyber Event adversely affected our fiscal 2022 revenues by approximately $8 million in lost sales. We incurred approximately $5 million of costs related to the Cyber Event in 2022 for idle plant costs, direct labor costs during the period our manufacturing facilities were idle and third party remediation costs. Approximately $4.8 million of the Cyber Event costs were included in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations and approximately $0.3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. We have insurance and anticipate that a portion of our financial losses related to the Cyber Event will ultimately be covered by insurance. We expect to incur ongoing costs to enhance data security and plan to take further steps to prevent unauthorized access to, or manipulation of, our systems and data. Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic On March 1, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and the virus continues to impact areas where we operate and sell our products and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has had material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The duration of the pandemic will ultimately determine the extent to which our operations are impacted. During fiscal year 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have less of an impact on our overall financial results compared with the prior year as consolidated net sales increased 8.1% compared to 2021. However, continuing government imposed COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions in parts of China adversely impacted sales in China by approximately 13% compared with the prior year. Ongoing global supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures resulted in higher raw material costs, higher freight costs and shipping delays during 2022, which increased our operating costs and adversely impacted our gross profit margin. Management believes it is reasonably likely these impacts will continue to affect our future operations and results to some degree, particularly during the first half of 2023. During fiscal year 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic had less of an impact on our overall financial results compared with the prior year as consolidated net sales increased 8.8% compared to fiscal year 2020. Government stimulus programs, increased COVID-19 vaccination rates, and fewer COVID-19 related restrictions in some places contributed to a rebound in economic activity in certain countries in 2021 driving higher revenues globally compared to fiscal year 2020. Our global supply chain and manufacturing operations, however, experienced increased adverse impacts and disruptions in 2021 from COVID-19. These impacts included raw material shortages, raw material cost increases, higher freight costs, shipping delays, and labor shortages particularly in the United States. These impacts to our supply chain and manufacturing operations increased our costs, decreased our ability to achieve manufacturing targets, increased lead times to our customers, and adversely affected our gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales. During fiscal year 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in 17.9% lower consolidated net sales compared to fiscal year 2019. We temporarily suspended production in certain manufacturing facilities in 2020 due to government lockdowns, shelter in place orders and reduced demand. Our sales mix shifted towards more non-corporate office market segments as the COVID-19 pandemic reduced corporate spending, which impacted sales in the corporate office market. During 2020, the Company recorded $12.9 million of voluntary and involuntary severance costs, which were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Also in fiscal year 2020, government grants and payroll protection programs were available in various countries globally to provide assistance to companies impacted by the pandemic. The CARES Act enacted in the United States (see Note 17 entitled Income Taxes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information) and a payroll protection program enacted in the Netherlands (the NOW Program ) provided benefits related to payroll costs either as reimbursements, lower payroll tax rates or deferral of payroll tax payments. The NOW Program provided eligible companies with reimbursement of labor costs as an incentive to retain employees and continue paying them in accordance with the Company customary compensation practices. During fiscal year 2020, the Company qualified for benefits under several payroll protection programs and recognized a reduction in payroll costs of approximately $7.3 million, which were recorded as a $6.1 million reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses and a $1.2 million reduction of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations, as the Company believes it is probable that the benefits received will not be repaid. During the first quarter of 2020, as a result of changes in macroeconomic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognized a charge of $121.3 million for the impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets. See Note 12 entitled Goodwill and Intangible Assets of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information. 27 Ta b le of Contents Analysis of Results of Operations Consolidated Results The following discussion and analyses reflect the factors and trends discussed in the preceding sections. Consolidated net sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar were approximately 47% in 2022, 50% in 2021, and 51% in 2020. Because we have substantial international operations, we are impacted, from time to time, by international developments that affect foreign currency transactions. In 2022, the weakening of the Euro, Australian dollar, British Pound sterling and Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar had a negative impact on our net sales and operating income. In 2021, the strengthening of the Euro, Australian dollar, Chinese Renminbi and British Pound sterling against the U.S. dollar had a positive impact on our net sales and operating income. In 2020, the strengthening of the Euro, British Pound sterling, and Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar had a positive impact on our net sales and operating loss. The following table presents the amounts (in U.S. dollars) by which the exchange rates for translating Euros, British Pounds sterling, Australian dollars, Chinese Renminbi and Canadian dollars into U.S. dollars have affected our consolidated net sales and operating income or loss during the past three years: 2022 2021 2020 (in millions) Impact of changes in foreign currency on consolidated net sales $ (58.8) $ 23.9 $ 7.1 Impact of changes in foreign currency on consolidated operating income (loss) (8.3) 3.2 0.9 The following table presents, as a percentage of net sales, certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations during the past three years: Fiscal Year 2022 2021 2020 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 66.3 64.0 62.8 Gross profit 33.7 36.0 37.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 25.0 27.0 30.2 Restructuring, asset impairment and other charges 0.2 0.3 (0.4) Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge 2.8 11.0 Operating income (loss) 5.7 8.7 (3.6) Interest/Other expense, net 2.6 2.7 3.6 Income (loss) before income tax expense 3.1 6.0 (7.2) Income tax expense (benefit) 1.7 1.4 (0.7) Net income (loss) 1.4 % 4.6 % (6.5) % Consolidated Net Sales Below we provide information regarding our consolidated net sales and analyze those results for each of the last three fiscal years. Fiscal year 2022 included 52 weeks, fiscal year 2021 included 52 weeks, and fiscal year 2020 included 53 weeks. Fiscal Year Percentage Change 2022 2021 2020 2022 compared with 2021 2021 compared with 2020 (in thousands) Consolidated net sales $ 1,297,919 $ 1,200,398 $ 1,103,262 8.1 % 8.8 % 28 Ta b le of Contents Consolidated net sales for 2022 compared with 2021 For 2022, our consolidated net sales increased $97.5 million (8.1%) compared to 2021, comprised of higher sales volumes (approximately 5.4%) and higher prices (approximately 2.7%, including the impact of currency fluctuations). Fluctuations in currency exchange rates had a negative impact on our year-over-year consolidated net sales comparison of approximately $58.8 million, meaning that if currency levels had remained constant year-over-year, our 2022 net sales would have been higher by this amount. On a market segment basis, the sales increase was most significant in the corporate office, retail and education market segments. See the segment results discussion below for additional information on market segments. Consolidated net sales for 2021 compared with 2020 For 2021, our consolidated net sales increased $97.1 million (8.8%) compared to 2020, comprised of higher sales volumes (approximately 5.1%) and higher prices (approximately 3.7%). Fluctuations in currency exchange rates had a positive impact on our year-over-year consolidated net sales comparison of approximately $23.9 million, meaning that if currency levels had remained constant year over year, our 2021 sales would have been lower by this amount. On a market segment basis, the sales increase was most significant in non-corporate office market segments including retail, education and healthcare. See the segment results discussion below for additional information on market segments. Consolidated Cost and Expenses The following table presents our consolidated cost of sales and selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses during the past three years: Fiscal Year Percentage Change 2022 2021 2020 2022 compared with 2021 2021 compared with 2020 (in thousands) Consolidated cost of sales $ 860,186 $ 767,665 $ 692,688 12.1 % 10.8 % Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses 324,190 324,315 333,229 0.0 % (2.7) % Consolidated Cost of Sales For 2022, our consolidated cost of sales increased $92.5 million (12.1%) compared to 2021, primarily due to higher sales and continuing inflationary pressures on raw materials and freight costs. The increase in consolidated cost of sales was also impacted by higher energy costs (which were up approximately 28%) in our EAAA segment primarily due to shortages in the supply of natural gas in connection with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated cost of sales of approximately $37.2 million (4.8%) compared to last year. The increase in cost of sales in 2022 also includes $4.8 million of costs related to the Cyber Event, as discussed above. As a percentage of net sales, our consolidated cost of sales increased to 66.3% in 2022 versus 64.0% in 2021, due to higher raw materials, freight and energy costs, as discussed above. Management believes it is reasonably likely the inflationary pressures experienced in 2022 will continue to some degree in 2023, particularly in the first half of 2023, and expects to continue managing these pressures through higher sales prices, product mix and plant productivity initiatives. For 2021, our consolidated cost of sales increased $75.0 million (10.8%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher net sales and the continued adverse impacts of COVID-19. Currency translation had a $16.2 million (2.3%) negative impact on the year-over-year comparison. In 2021, the impact of COVID-19 continued to challenge our global supply chain which contributed to higher cost of sales and lower gross profit margins particularly in the United States. As a percentage of net sales, our consolidated cost of sales increased to 64.0% in 2021 versus 62.8% in 2020, primarily due to inflationary pressures on raw materials, freight and labor costs driving an approximately 3.4% increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales compared to the prior year. The increase in our consolidated cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by productivity efficiencies during the year. 29 Ta b le of Contents Consolidated Gross Profit For 2022, consolidated gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 33.7% compared to 36.0% for 2021. The decrease was primarily due to continuing inflationary pressures for raw materials and freight costs. As noted above, management believes it is reasonably likely the inflationary pressures experienced in 2022 will continue to some degree in 2023, particularly in the first half of 2023, and expects to continue managing these pressures through higher sales prices and product mix. For 2021, consolidated gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 36.0% compared with 37.2% for 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19 and the resulting supply chain challenges driving higher costs and shortages for raw materials and labor. Consolidated SG&A Expenses For 2022, our consolidated SG&A expenses were $324.2 million versus $324.3 million in 2021. Currency translation had a $9.5 million (4.1%) positive impact on the year-over-year comparison. Consolidated SG&A expenses were flat compared to 2021 as higher selling expenses of approximately $8.5 million due to higher sales were offset by lower labor costs due to prior year employee reductions and $5.4 million in lower professional fees due to prior year insurance recoveries. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 25.0% in 2022 versus 27.0% in 2021. For 2021, our consolidated SG&A expenses decreased $8.9 million (2.7%) versus 2020. Currency translation had a $5.3 million (1.6%) negative impact on the year-over-year comparison. Consolidated SG&A expenses were lower in 2021 primarily due to (1) lower legal fees and other related costs of $12.6 million primarily due to the settlement of the SEC matter in the prior year period, and (2) lower severance costs of $9.1 million as the prior year included additional cost reduction initiatives implemented in response to COVID-19 as discussed above. These decreases were partially offset by higher labor costs of approximately $11.0 million due to higher performance-based compensation as target performance measures were achieved in 2021, partially offset by cost savings from prior year headcount reduction initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 27.0% in 2021 versus 30.2% in 2020. Restructuring Plans On September 8, 2021, the Company committed to a restructuring plan that continues to focus on efforts to improve efficiencies and decrease costs across its worldwide operations. The plan involves a reduction of approximately 188 employees and the closure of the Company carpet tile manufacturing facility in Thailand at the end of the first quarter of 2022. In connection with this plan, the Company recognized restructuring charges of $2.0 million comprised of severance and asset impairment charges and other related charges during fiscal year 2022. In conjunction with the closure of its Thailand facility, the Company recorded a write-down of inventory of $2.5 million in fiscal year 2022 within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 16 entitled Restructuring and Other Charges of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information. Goodwill, Intangible Asset and Fixed Asset Impairment During 2022 and 2020, we recognized charges of $36.2 million and $121.3 million, respectively, for the impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets. See Note 12 entitled Goodwill and Intangible Assets of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information. During 2022 and 2021, we recognized fixed asset impairment charges of $2.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively, for projects that were abandoned. During 2020, we recognized fixed asset impairment charges of $5.0 million primarily related to certain FLOR design center closures and other projects that were abandoned or indefinitely delayed. These charges are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Interest Expense For 2022, our interest expense was $29.9 million, versus $29.7 million in 2021. Higher interest rates in 2022 were offset by lower outstanding term loan borrowings under the Syndicated Credit Facility. Our average borrowing rate under the Syndicated Credit Facility as of January 1, 2023 was 5.78% compared to 1.91% at January 2, 2022. 30 Ta b le of Contents For 2021, our interest expense increased $0.5 million to $29.7 million, versus $29.2 million in 2020, primarily due to (1) higher fixed-rate interest expense on the Senior Notes debt, which replaced variable-rate debt under the Syndicated Credit Facility, and (2) $4.9 million of deferred losses recognized on terminated interest rate swaps that were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense during the year. These increases were partially offset by $60 million of lower outstanding borrowings under the Syndicated Credit Facility compared to 2020. Our average borrowing rate under the Syndicated Credit Facility was 1.91% for 2021 compared to 1.89% in 2020. Tax For the year ended January 1, 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of $22.4 million on pre-tax income of $41.9 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 53.3%, as compared to an income tax expense of $17.4 million on pre-tax income of $72.6 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.0% for the year ended January 2, 2022. The effective tax rate for the year ended January 1, 2023 was significantly impacted by a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge. Excluding the impact of the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge, the effective tax rate was 31.4% for the year ended January 1, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate, excluding the goodwill impairment charge, was primarily due to an increase in non-deductible employee compensation, an increase in the valuation allowance on net operating loss and interest carryforwards, unfavorable changes related to the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance policies and unfavorable changes related to foreign exchange movements. For the year ended January 2, 2022, the Company recorded income tax expense of $17.4 million on pre-tax income of $72.6 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.0%, as compared to an income tax benefit of $7.5 million on pre-tax loss of $79.4 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 9.4% for the year ended January 3, 2021. The effective tax rate for the year ended January 3, 2021 was significantly impacted by a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and recognition of income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken in prior years on discontinued operations. Excluding the impact of the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and recognition of income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions on discontinued operations, the effective tax rate was 14.1% for the year ended January 3, 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended January 2, 2022 as compared to the year ended January 3, 2021 was primarily due to the one-time favorable impacts of amending prior year tax returns during the period ended January 3, 2021, an increase in non-deductible employee compensation and an increase in the valuation allowance on net operating loss and interest carryforwards. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in non-deductible business expenses. Segment Results As discussed above, in 2021 the Company determined that it has two operating and reportable segments AMS and EAAA. Segment information presented below for 2020 has been recast to conform to the new reportable segment structure. See Note 20 entitled Segment Information included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information . AMS Segment Net Sales and Adjusted Operating Income ( AOI ) The following table presents AMS segment net sales and AOI for the last three fiscal years: Fiscal Year Percentage Change 2022 2021 2020 2022 compared with 2021 2021 compared with 2020 (in thousands) AMS segment net sales $ 753,740 $ 651,216 $ 593,418 15.7 % 9.7 % AMS segment AOI (1) 102,370 85,014 89,097 20.4 % (4.6) % (1) Includes allocation of corporate SG&A expenses. Excludes intangible asset impairment charges, Cyber Event costs, and restructuring, asset impairment, severance and other costs. See Note 20 entitled Segment Information included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. AMS segment net sales for 2022 compared with 2021 During 2022, net sales in AMS increased 15.7% versus 2021, comprised of higher sales volumes and higher prices. On a market segment basis, the AMS sales increase was most significant in the retail (up 54.2%), education (up 18.9%), public buildings (up 18.0%), corporate office (up 11.7%) and healthcare (up 5.8%) market segments. These increases were partially offset by decreases in the consumer residential (down 8.7%) market segment. 31 Ta b le of Contents AMS segment net sales for 2021 compared with 2020 During 2021, net sales in AMS increased 9.7% versus 2020, comprised of higher sales volumes and higher prices. On a market segment basis, the AMS sales increase was most significant in non-corporate office market segments including healthcare (up 19.1%), retail (up 19.1%) and education (up 18.3%). Sales in the corporate office market increased 6.8% in 2021 compared to 2020. These increases were partially offset by decreases in the hospitality (down 38.3%) and public buildings (down 20%) market segments. AMS AOI for 2022 compared with 2021 AOI in AMS increased 20.4% during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher sales. AMS SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2022 decreased approximately 0.7% compared to 2021, primarily due to lower administrative costs, which contributed to the increase in AOI for the current year. As a percentage of net sales, AOI increased to 13.6% in 2022 versus 13.1% in 2021. AMS AOI for 2021 compared with 2020 AOI in AMS decreased 4.6% during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher cost of sales as a result of inflationary pressures on raw materials, freight and labor costs driving an approximately 3.0% increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales compared to the prior year. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by productivity efficiencies during the year. AOI as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2021 decreased to 13.1% compared to 15.0% in 2020 due to the global supply chain pressures discussed above. EAAA Segment Net Sales and AOI The following table presents EAAA segment net sales and AOI for the last three fiscal years: Fiscal Year Percentage Change 2022 2021 2020 2022 compared with 2021 2021 compared with 2020 (in thousands) EAAA segment net sales $ 544,179 $ 549,182 $ 509,844 (0.9) % 7.7 % EAAA segment AOI (1) 30,058 37,268 21,403 (19.3) % 74.1 % (1) Includes allocation of corporate SG&A expenses. Excludes goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, purchase accounting amortization, Thailand plant closure inventory write-down, Cyber Event costs, and restructuring, asset impairment, severance and other costs. See Note 20 entitled Segment Information included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. EAAA segment net sales for 2022 compared with 2021 During 2022, net sales in EAAA decreased 0.9% versus 2021. Higher selling prices and volume were offset by the impact of negative currency fluctuations of approximately $56.7 million (10.3%) for 2022 compared to 2021 due to the weakening of the Euro, Australian dollar, British Pound sterling and Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. On a market segment basis, EAAA sales increased in the corporate office (up 6.2%) and hospitality (up 22.3%) market segments. These increases were offset by decreases in the public buildings (down 25.7%), transportation (down 21.3%), retail (down 14.9%) and healthcare (down 8.2%) market segments. EAAA segment net sales for 2021 compared with 2020 During 2021, net sales in EAAA increased 7.7% versus 2020, comprised of higher sales volumes and higher prices. Currency fluctuations had an approximately $21.5 million (4.2%) positive impact on EAAA 2021 sales compared to 2020 due to the strengthening of the Euro, British Pound sterling, Australian dollar and the Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. On a market segment basis, the 2021 EAAA sales increase was most significant in non-corporate office market segments including retail (up 53.8%), public buildings (up 30.2%) and healthcare (up 19.0%). Sales in the corporate office market increased 2.4% in 2021 compared to 2020. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the education (down 2.6%) market segment. 32 Ta b le of Contents EAAA AOI for 2022 compared with 2021 AOI in EAAA decreased 19.3% during 2022 versus 2021 due to continuing inflationary pressures on raw materials and higher energy costs (which were up approximately 28%) primarily due to natural gas shortages in connection with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The decrease in AOI was also due to negative currency fluctuations of approximately $6.5 million (9.9%) due to the weakening of the Euro, Australian dollar, British Pound sterling and Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. EAAA SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2022 decreased approximately 2.5% compared to last year, which partially offset the negative impacts on AOI discussed above. As a percentage of net sales, AOI decreased to 5.5% in 2022 versus 6.8% in 2021. EAAA AOI for 2021 compared with 2020 AOI in EAAA increased 74.1% during 2021 versus 2020. Currency fluctuations had an approximately $3.1 million (6.4%) positive impact on AOI for 2021. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 23.0% in 2021 compared to 24.6% in 2020 due to savings from cost reduction initiatives implemented in the prior year. AOI as a percentage of net sales increased to 6.8% in 2021 compared to 4.2% in 2020, due primarily to higher sales as discussed above. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources General In our business, we require cash and other liquid assets primarily to purchase raw materials and to pay other manufacturing costs, in addition to funding normal course SG&A expenses, anticipated capital expenditures, interest expense and potential special projects. We generate our cash and other liquidity requirements primarily from our operations and from borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility (the Facility ) discussed below. We anticipate that our liquidity is sufficient to meet our obligations for the next 12 months, and we expect to generate sufficient cash to meet our long-term obligations. Below is a summary of our material cash requirements for future periods: Payments Due by Period Short-Term Long-Term Total (in thousands) Long-term debt obligations $ 10,211 $ 516,121 $ 526,332 Operating and finance lease obligations 16,838 101,729 118,567 Expected interest payments 29,283 122,669 151,952 Purchase obligations 25,658 7,054 32,712 Pension cash obligations 4,385 28,007 32,392 Total $ 86,375 $ 775,580 $ 861,955 Historically, we use more cash in the first half of the fiscal year, as we pay insurance premiums, taxes and incentive compensation and build up inventory in preparation for the holiday/vacation season of our international operations. As outlined in the table above, we have approximately $86.4 million in material contractual cash obligations due within the next year, which includes, among other things, scheduled debt repayments under the Facility, pension contributions, interest payments on our debt, and lease commitments. Our long-term debt obligations include the contractually scheduled principal repayment of our term loan and revolving loan borrowings under the Facility, which matures in 2027, and $300 million on our Senior Notes due in 2028. Operating and finance lease obligations consist of undiscounted lease payments due over the term of the lease. Expected interest payments are those associated with borrowings under the Facility and Senior Notes consistent with our contractually scheduled principal repayments. Our purchase obligations are for non-cancellable agreements primarily for raw material purchases and capital expenditures. Our pension obligations include contributions and expected benefit payments to be paid by the Company related to certain defined benefit pension plans and excludes the expected benefit payments for two of our funded foreign defined benefit plans as these obligations will be paid by the plans over the next ten years. Based on current interest rates and debt levels, we expect our aggregate interest expense for 2023 to be between $32 million and $33 million. We estimate aggregate capital expenditures in 2023 to be approximately $32 million, although we are not committed to these amounts. 33 Ta b le of Contents Liquidity At January 1, 2023, we had $97.6 million in cash. Approximately $5.5 million of this cash was located in the U.S., and the remaining $92.1 million was located outside of the U.S. The cash located outside of the U.S. is indefinitely reinvested in the respective jurisdictions (except as identified below). We believe that our strategic plans and business needs, particularly for working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements in Europe, Asia, and Australia, support our assertion that a portion of our cash in foreign locations will be reinvested and remittance will be postponed indefinitely. Of the $92.1 million of cash in foreign jurisdictions, approximately $43.4 million represents earnings which we have determined are not permanently reinvested, and as such we have provided for foreign withholding and U.S. state income taxes on these amounts in accordance with applicable accounting standards. As of January 1, 2023, we had $226.3 million of borrowings outstanding under our Facility, of which $202.1 million were term loan borrowings and $24.2 million were revolving loan borrowings. Additionally, $1.6 million in letters of credit were outstanding under the Facility at the end of fiscal year 2022. As of January 1, 2023, we had additional borrowing capacity of $274.1 million under the Facility. As of January 1, 2023, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Facility was 5.78%. As of January 1, 2023, there were no other lines of credit available to the Company. On November 17, 2020, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2028 (the Senior Notes ), which are discussed further below. As of January 1, 2023, we had $300.0 million of Senior Notes outstanding. It is important for you to consider that we have a significant amount of indebtedness. Our Facility matures in October of 2027, and the Senior Notes, as discussed below, mature in December 2028. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate or refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to refinance our debt or obtain new financing, we would have to consider other options, such as selling assets to meet our debt service obligations and other liquidity needs, or using cash, if available, that would have been used for other business purposes. It is also important for you to consider that borrowings under our Facility comprise a substantial portion of our indebtedness, and that these borrowings are based on variable interest rates (as described below) that expose the Company to the risk that interest rates may increase. During 2020, we entered into fixed rate Senior Notes (as described below), which reduced the amount of indebtedness subject to interest rate risk. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we terminated our interest rate swaps that were previously being used to fix a portion of our variable rate debt. For information regarding the current variable interest rates of these borrowings, the potential impact on our interest expense from hypothetical increases in short term interest rates, and the interest rate swap transaction, please see the discussion in Item 7A of this Report. We are not a party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements. Balance Sheet Inventories, net, were $306.3 million at January 1, 2023 compared to $265.1 million at January 2, 2022. The increase of $41.2 million was primarily due to higher raw material costs and freight costs due to continuing inflationary pressures and inventory build driven by higher customer demand. 34 Ta b le of Contents Analysis of Cash Flows The following table presents a summary of cash flows for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020: Fiscal Year 2022 2021 2020 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 43,061 $ 86,689 $ 119,070 Investing activities (18,437) (28,071) (61,689) Financing activities (19,490) (60,858) (42,715) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (4,822) (3,561) 7,086 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 312 (5,801) 21,752 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 97,252 103,053 81,301 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 97,564 $ 97,252 $ 103,053 We ended 2022 with $97.6 million in cash, an increase of $0.3 million during the year. The increase was primarily due to the following: Cash provided by operating activities was $43.1 million for 2022, which represents a decrease of $43.6 million compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a greater use of cash for working capital during 2022. Specifically, higher inventories as a result of higher raw material costs and input costs contributed to the greater use of cash for working capital compared to last year. Higher variable compensation payouts in the first quarter of 2022 (related to 2021 performance) also contributed to the increased use of cash for 2022. Cash provided by operating activities in 2022 also was negatively impacted by delays in billings due to the Cyber Event, which pushed the due dates for those delayed billings from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2023. Cash used in investing activities was $18.4 million for 2022, which represents a decrease of $9.6 million compared to 2021. The decrease from the comparable period was primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures due to reduced capital investment. Cash used in financing activities was $19.5 million for 2022, which represents a decrease of $41.4 million compared to 2021. The year-over-year difference was primarily due to higher revolving loan borrowings in 2022 as a source of cash to fund operating activities as described above, offset by a use of cash for repurchases of the Company common stock pursuant to a new share repurchase program adopted in the second quarter of 2022. Fiscal year 2021 also includes higher repayments of approximately $60 million of term loan borrowings which contributed to a greater use of cash in that period. We ended 2021 with $97.3 million in cash, a decrease of $5.8 million during the year. The decrease was primarily due to the following: Cash provided by operating activities was $86.7 million for 2021, which represents a decrease of $32.4 million compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a greater use of cash for working capital during 2021. Specifically, higher accounts receivable and inventories primarily attributable to increased customer demand in 2021 were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses that contributed positively to the change in working capital. Lower variable compensation payouts in 2021 (related to 2020 performance) had a positive impact on cash provided by operating activities, partially offsetting the decrease from changes in working capital. Cash used in investing activities was $28.1 million for 2021, which represents a decrease of $33.6 million from 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower capital expenditures compared to 2020 as two major capital projects were substantially completed in the prior year. Cash used in financing activities was $60.9 million for 2021, which represents an increase of $18.1 million compared to 2020. In 2021, we repaid approximately $60 million in term loan borrowings which contributed to the increase in cash used in financing activities (compared with 2020, when repayments on term loan borrowings were largely funded with the proceeds from the issuance of the $300 million Senior Notes). 35 Ta b le of Contents We ended 2020 with $103.1 million in cash, an increase of $21.8 million during the year. The increase was primarily due to the following: Cash provided by operating activities was $119.1 million for 2020, which represents a decrease of $22.7 million compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower net income due to the impacts of COVID-19, offset by working capital sources of cash, specifically a decrease in accounts receivable of $40.1 million, lower inventories of $38.7 million and lower prepaid and other expenses of $13.0 million. These sources of cash were offset by a $60.9 million use of cash in accounts payable and accrued expenses to fund normal operations. Cash used in investing activities was $61.7 million for 2020, which represents a decrease of $12.5 million from 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower capital expenditures compared to 2019 due to fewer project demands and lower capital investment as a result of the impacts of COVID-19. Cash used in financing activities was $42.7 million for 2020, which represents a decrease of $24.0 million compared to 2019. Financing activities for 2020 include higher loan borrowings of $320.0 million primarily due to the issuance of $300 million of Senior Notes, offset by (1) higher repayments of revolving and term loan borrowings as the proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes were used to repay $290.7 million of outstanding term and revolving loan borrowings under the Facility, and (2) a decrease in dividends paid of $9.8 million. Share Repurchases In the second quarter of 2022, the Company adopted a new share repurchase program in which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $100 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. The program has no specific expiration date. During 2022, the Company repurchased and retired an aggregate of 1,383,682 shares at a weighted average price of $12.41 per share, or $17.2 million, pursuant to this program. As of January 1, 2023, approximately $82.8 million remains authorized pursuant to this program for future share repurchases. The program does not require the Company to repurchase a specific number or amount of shares, or to do so within any specific time periods. Syndicated Credit Facility In the normal course of business, in addition to using our available cash, we fund our operations by borrowing under our Facility. At January 1, 2023, the Facility provided the Company and certain of its subsidiaries with a multicurrency revolving loan facility up to $300 million, as well as other U.S. denominated and multicurrency term loans. On October 14, 2022, in connection with the fifth amendment to the Facility, the maturity date was extended to October 2027. Material terms under the Facility are discussed below. For additional information please see Note 9 entitled Long-Term Debt in Item 8 of this Report. Interest Rates and Fees Under the Facility, interest on base rate loans is charged at varying rates computed by applying a margin ranging from 0.25% to 2.00%, depending on the Company consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the Facility agreement) as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter. Interest on Eurocurrency-based loans (or SOFR-based and alternative currency loans following the fifth amendment to the Facility as discussed below) and fees for letters of credit are charged at varying rates computed by applying a margin ranging from 1.25% to 3.00% over the applicable Eurocurrency rate (or SOFR rate or alternative currency rate following the fifth amendment to the Facility as discussed below), depending on the Company consolidated net leverage ratio as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter. In addition, the Company pays a commitment fee ranging from 0.20% to 0.40% per annum (depending on the Company consolidated net leverage ratio as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter) on the unused portion of the Facility. 36 Ta b le of Contents LIBOR Transition The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA ), which regulates the London interbank offered rate ( LIBOR ), announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicated that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis was not guaranteed after 2021, and LIBOR may be discontinued or modified. Additionally, certain U.S. dollar LIBOR rates will be discontinued by June 2023. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ( SOFR ) in April 2018 as an alternative for LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. On September 29, 2022 the FCA announced its decision to stop publishing the 1-month and 6-month LIBOR rates by the end of March 2023. On December 9, 2021 and October 14, 2022, we entered into the fourth and fifth amendments, respectively, to our Facility. These amendments, among other changes, replaced the LIBOR benchmark rates with specified successor benchmark rates, including SOFR benchmark interest rates applicable to all loans denominated in U.S. dollars. Covenants The Facility contains standard and customary covenants for agreements of this type, including various reporting, affirmative and negative covenants. Among other things, these covenants limit our ability to: create or incur liens on assets; make acquisitions of or investments in businesses (in excess of certain specified amounts); engage in any material line of business substantially different from the Company current lines of business; incur indebtedness or contingent obligations; sell or dispose of assets (in excess of certain specified amounts); pay dividends or repurchase our stock (in excess of certain specified amounts); repay other indebtedness prior to maturity unless we meet certain conditions; and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. The Facility also requires us to remain in compliance with the following financial covenants as of the end of each fiscal quarter, based on our consolidated results for the year then ended: Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio: Must be no greater than 3.00:1.00. Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio: Must be no less than 2.25:1.00. Events of Default If we breach or fail to perform any of the affirmative or negative covenants under the Facility, or if other specified events occur (such as a bankruptcy or similar event or a change of control of Interface, Inc. or certain subsidiaries, or if we breach or fail to perform any covenant or agreement contained in any instrument relating to any of our other indebtedness exceeding $20 million), after giving effect to any applicable notice and right to cure provisions, an event of default will exist. If an event of default exists and is continuing, the lenders Administrative Agent may, and upon the written request of a specified percentage of the lender group shall: declare all commitments of the lenders under the facility terminated; declare all amounts outstanding or accrued thereunder immediately due and payable; and exercise other rights and remedies available to them under the agreement and applicable law. Collateral Pursuant to a Second Amended and Restated Security and Pledge Agreement, the Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of Interface, Inc. and our domestic subsidiaries (subject to exceptions for certain immaterial subsidiaries), including all of the stock of our domestic subsidiaries and up to 65% of the stock of our first-tier material foreign subsidiaries. If an event of default occurs under the Facility, the lenders Administrative Agent may, upon the request of a specified percentage of lenders, exercise remedies with respect to the collateral, including, in some instances, foreclosing mortgages on real estate assets, taking possession of or selling personal property assets, collecting accounts receivable, or exercising proxies to take control of the pledged stock of domestic and first-tier material foreign subsidiaries. 37 Ta b le of Contents Under the Facility, we are required to make quarterly amortization payments of the term loan borrowings. The amortization payments are due on the last day of the calendar quarter. We are in compliance with all covenants under the Facility and anticipate that we will remain in compliance with the covenants for the foreseeable future. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we terminated our interest rate swaps and paid approximately $13 million to terminate the swap agreements. For additional information on interest rates, please see Item 7A and Note 9 entitled Long-Term Debt in Item 8 of this Report. Senior Notes On November 17, 2020, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2028. The Senior Notes bear an interest rate at 5.50% per annum and mature on December 1, 2028. Interest is paid semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The Company used the net proceeds to repay $269.7 million of outstanding term loan borrowings and $21.0 million of outstanding revolving loan borrowings under the Facility. In connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company recorded $5.7 million of debt issuance costs. These debt issuance costs were recorded as a reduction of long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized over the life of the outstanding debt. The Senior Notes are unsecured and are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by each of the Company material domestic subsidiaries, all of which also guarantee the obligations of the Company under its existing Facility. The Company foreign subsidiaries and certain non-material domestic subsidiaries are considered non-guarantors. Net sales for the non-guarantor subsidiaries were approximately $597 million for fiscal year 2022, $594 million for fiscal year 2021, and $548 million for fiscal year 2020. Total indebtedness of the non-guarantor subsidiaries was approximately $43 million as of January 1, 2023, and $45 million as of January 2, 2022. The Senior Notes can be redeemed on or after December 1, 2023, at specified redemption prices. See Note 9 entitled Long-Term Debt in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Forward-Looking Statements The Company continues to be challenged by high inflation and a dynamic geopolitical environment. We e xpect these impacts to include significant cost increases in our raw materials globally and continued labor cost increases. The impacts may also potentially include raw material shortages, higher freight costs, shipping delays, and other disruptions. These impacts to our supply chain and manufacturing will increase our costs and adversely affect our gross margins, they may inhibit our ability to manufacture and ship product timely, and at times they may inhibit our ability to meet customer demands and expectations. To mitigate these impacts, we plan to continue evaluating our cost structure and global manufacturing footprint to identify and activate opportunities to decrease costs and optimize our global cost structure. The COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain disruptions continue to impact areas where we sell our products and services most recently in China. Its impacts on our full fiscal year 2023 results and beyond are uncertain. We believe the most significant elements of uncertainty are (1) the intensity and duration of the impact on construction, renovation, and remodeling; (2) corporate, government, and consumer spending levels and sentiment; (3) the ability of our sales channels, supply chain, manufacturing, and distribution partners to continue operating through disruptions; and (4) the severity of global supply chain disruptions and their effects on inflation, labor costs, raw material shortages, and other factors that disrupt our supply chain and manufacturing facilities. Any or all of these factors could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and outlook. As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect companies with global operations, specifically as it relates to the global supply chain, we anticipate that, at a minimum, our business and results in the first half of 2023 will continue to be affected, and the timeline and pace of recovery is uncertain. Cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and other sources of liquidity are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash requirements. However, the Company cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including the uncertainty of COVID-19 and its impact on global operations, raw material availability and cost, demand for our products, and other factors described in Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 38 Ta b le of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimations about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events may not develop as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment at the asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment is indicated. A loss is then recognized for the difference, if any, between the fair value of the asset (as estimated by management using its best judgment) and the carrying value of the asset. Management judgement in estimating the undiscounted cash flows based on market conditions and trends, and other industry specific metrics used in determining the fair value is subject to uncertainty. If actual market value is less favorable than that estimated by management, additional write-downs may be required. Deferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities. The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies in accordance with applicable accounting standards and are based on management assumptions and estimates regarding future operating results and levels of taxable income, as well as management judgment regarding the interpretation of the provisions of applicable accounting standards. The carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable are based on management interpretations of applicable tax laws and incorporate management assumptions and judgments regarding the use of tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. The use of different estimates, assumptions and judgments in connection with accounting for income taxes may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and results of operations. We evaluate the recoverability of these deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income inherently rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short-term and long-term business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. To the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. As of January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of $162.8 million and $153.0 million, respectively. Certain of these state net operating loss carryforwards are reserved with a valuation allowance because, based on the available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize those deferred tax assets in the future. The remaining year-end 2022 amounts are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods. If the actual amounts of taxable income differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. Goodwill. We review the carrying values of our goodwill annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of each reporting may exceed its fair value as set forth in Accounting Standards Codification 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other , as amended by Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2017-04 . We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. We utilize the present value of expected future cash flows and the guideline public company method to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units. The present value model requires management to estimate future cash flows, the timing of these cash flows, and a discount rate based on a weighted average cost of capital. The assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows and the development of any forecasts to be used in the fair value determination are subject to inherent risk and judgement. If we determine that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we measure the goodwill impairment charge based on the excess of the reporting unit carrying value over its fair value consistent with ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment , which we adopted on December 30, 2019. 39 Ta b le of Contents During the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed our annual goodwill quantitative testing. We considered factors such as, but not limited to, our expectations for the short-term and long-term impacts of macroeconomic factors, including ongoing inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, and our expected financial performance, including planned revenue and operating income of each reporting unit. The discount rate used for each reporting unit ranged from 13.5% to 14.0%, which primarily fluctuated based on a country risk premium assigned to the geographical region of the reporting unit. For fiscal 2022, we determined that the carrying value of our EMEA reporting unit exceeded its fair value and that the associated goodwill was impaired. We recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $29.4 million to write off all the goodwill allocated to our EMEA reporting unit as the excess of carrying value over fair value was higher than the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit. The fair value of our Americas reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 71%, and the Americas reporting unit was not impaired as of the 2022 measurement date. The Americas reporting unit had a goodwill balance of $102.4 million at the end of fiscal 2022. The goodwill balance allocated to our Asia-Pacific reporting unit was previously written off in connection with the 2020 goodwill impairment, as described below. We have not made any material changes to our goodwill impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. Currently, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate impairment losses. However, we cannot predict or control market factors, including the impact of macroeconomic conditions and the impact of certain risks inherent to our operations, as described in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to additional goodwill impairment losses that could be material. During the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020 we performed the annual goodwill impairment test consistent with the methodology described above, and all reporting units that had a goodwill balance were noted to have a fair value that exceeded their carrying value. In the first quarter of 2020, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test as there were indicators of impairment due to the impact of COVID-19 to our operations. As a result, in the first quarter of 2020, we determined that our EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units were impaired and recorded goodwill impairment charges of $99.2 million and $17.3 million, respectively. See Note 12 entitled Goodwill and Intangible Assets of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information. Inventories. We determine the value of inventories using the lower of cost or net realizable value. We write down inventories for the difference between the carrying value of the inventories and their net realizable value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. Management judgement in estimating our reserves for inventory obsolescence is based on continuous examination of our inventories to determine if there are indicators that carrying values exceed net realizable values. Experience has shown that significant indicators that could require the need for additional inventory write-downs are the age of the inventory, the length of its product life cycles, anticipated demand for our products and current economic conditions. While we believe that adequate write-downs for inventory obsolescence have been made in the consolidated financial statements, consumer tastes and preferences may continue to change, and we could experience additional inventory write-downs in the future. Our inventory reserve on January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, was $28.5 million and $27.1 million, respectively. To the extent that actual obsolescence of our inventory differs from our estimate by 10%, our 2022 net income would be higher or lower by approximately $1.3 million, on an after-tax basis. 40 Ta b le of Contents Pension Benefits. Net pension expense recorded is based on, among other things, assumptions about the discount rate, estimated return on plan assets and salary increases. While management believes these assumptions are reasonable, changes in these and other factors and differences between actual and assumed changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of our plans above certain thresholds could cause net annual expense to increase or decrease materially from year to year. The actuarial assumptions used in our salary continuation plan and our foreign defined benefit plans reporting are reviewed periodically and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension benefit obligation. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on weighted average expected returns for each asset class. Expected returns reflect a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial markets, and include input from actuaries, investment service firms and investment managers. The table below represents the changes to the projected benefit obligation as a result of changes in discount rate assumptions: Foreign Defined Benefit Plans Increase (Decrease) in Projected Benefit Obligation (in millions) 1% increase in actuarial assumption for discount rate $ (22.5) 1% decrease in actuarial assumption for discount rate 26.7 Domestic Salary Continuation Plan Increase (Decrease) in Projected Benefit Obligation (in millions) 1% increase in actuarial assumption for discount rate $ (1.9) 1% decrease in actuarial assumption for discount rate 2.2 Allowances for Expected Credit Losses. We maintain allowances for expected credit losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. Estimating the amount of future expected losses requires us to consider historical losses from our customers, as well as current market conditions and future forecasts of our customers ability to make payments for goods and services. By its nature, such an estimate is highly subjective, and it is possible that the amount of accounts receivable that we are unable to collect may be different than the amount initially estimated. Our allowance for expected credit losses on January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, was $4.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively. To the extent the actual collectability of our accounts receivable differs from our estimates by 10%, our 2022 net income would be higher or lower by approximately $0.2 million, on an after-tax basis, depending on whether the actual collectability was better or worse, respectively, than the estimated allowance. Product Warranties. We typically provide limited warranties with respect to certain attributes of our carpet products (for example, warranties regarding excessive surface wear, edge ravel and static electricity) for periods ranging from ten to twenty years, depending on the particular carpet product and the environment in which the product is to be installed. Similar limited warranties are provided on certain attributes of our rubber and LVT products, typically for a period of 5 to 15 years. We typically warrant that any services performed will be free from defects in workmanship for a period of one year following completion. In the event of a breach of warranty, the remedy typically is limited to repair of the problem or replacement of the affected product. We record a provision related to warranty costs based on historical experience and future expectations and periodically adjust these provisions to reflect changes in actual experience. Our warranty and sales allowance reserve on January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, was $2.1 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Actual warranty expense incurred could vary significantly from amounts that we estimate. To the extent the actual warranty expense differs from our estimates by 10%, our 2022 net income would be higher or lower by approximately $0.1 million, on an after-tax basis, depending on whether the actual expense is lower or higher, respectively, than the estimated provision.
