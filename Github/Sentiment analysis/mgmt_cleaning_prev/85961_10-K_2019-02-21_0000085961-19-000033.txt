ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8 of this report on Form 10-K. The following MD&A describes the principal factors affecting results of operations, financial resources, liquidity, contractual cash obligations, and critical accounting estimates. The information presented in the MD&A is for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 unless otherwise noted. OVERVIEW Ryder is a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions. Our operating segments are aggregated into reportable business segments based upon similar economic characteristics, products, services, customers and delivery methods. We report our financial performance based on three business segments: (1) FMS, which provides full service leasing and leasing with flexible maintenance options, commercial rental, and contract or transactional maintenance services of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.; (2) DTS, which provides turnkey transportation solutions in the U.S. that includes dedicated vehicles, drivers and engineering and administrative support; and (3) SCS, which provides integrated logistics solutions, including distribution, management, dedicated transportation and professional services primarily in North America. Dedicated transportation services provided as part of an integrated, multi-service, supply chain solution to SCS customers are reported in the SCS business segment. The FMS business, our largest segment, had total revenue (net of intercompany eliminations) and assets in 2018 of $4.68 billion and $11.70 billion , respectively, representing 56% of our consolidated revenue and 90% of consolidated assets. DTS total revenue and assets in 2018 were $1.33 billion and $325 million , respectively, representing 16% of our consolidated revenue and 2% of consolidated assets. SCS total revenue and assets in 2018 were $2.40 billion and $1.09 billion , respectively, representing 29% of our consolidated revenue and 8% of consolidated assets. We operate in highly competitive markets. Our customers select us based on numerous factors including service quality, price, technology and service offerings. As an alternative to using our services, customers may choose to provide these services for themselves, or may choose to obtain similar or alternative services from other third-party vendors. Our customer base includes enterprises operating in a variety of industries including food and beverage service (21%), transportation and logistics (21%), automotive (11%), retail and consumer goods (11%), industrial (8%), housing (8%), technology (7%), business and personal services (5%) and other (9%). In 2018, we acquired MXD, an e-commerce fulfillment provider with a national network of facilities, including last mile delivery capabilities. This acquisition added $164 million to our total revenue in 2018. This MD&A includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this MD&A for information on the non-GAAP measures included in the MD&A, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure and the reasons why we believe each measure is useful to investors. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) The following discussion provides a summary of financial highlights that are discussed in more detail throughout our MD&A and within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: Change 2018 2017 2016 2018/2017 2017/2016 (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Total revenue $ 8,409,215 7,297,054 6,758,138 15% 8% Operating revenue (1) 6,693,385 6,040,380 5,790,897 11% 4% Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes (EBT) $ 373,861 314,545 407,256 19% (23)% Comparable EBT (2) 406,509 370,506 449,923 10% (18)% Earnings from continuing operations (3) 275,607 792,289 265,232 (65)% 199% Comparable earnings from continuing operations (2) 306,160 241,101 291,080 27% (17)% Net earnings (3) 273,298 791,832 263,069 (65)% 201% Earnings per common share (EPS) Diluted Continuing operations (3) $ 5.21 14.90 4.95 (65)% 201% Comparable (2) 5.79 4.53 5.43 28% (17)% Net earnings (3) 5.17 14.89 4.91 (65)% 203% _________________ (1) Non-GAAP financial measure.

(2) Non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for a reconciliation of EBT, net earnings from continuing operations and earnings per diluted common share to the comparable measures and the reasons why management believes these measures are important to investors. (3) 2017 amounts reflect a tax benefit as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Refer to Note 14 , " Income Taxes ," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2018 , total revenue increased 15% to $8.41 billion and operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) increased 11% to $6.69 billion . Total revenue increased due to new business and higher volumes in all segments. Total and operating revenue growth also reflects the second quarter acquisition of MXD. Total revenue also grew from higher fuel costs passed through to customers. EBT increased 19% in 2018 , reflecting higher operating results in all business segments and lower pension expense. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased 6% to $1.64 billion in 2018 compared with $1.55 billion in 2017 , reflecting higher pre-tax earnings, partially offset by an increase in net working capital. Free cash flow from continuing operations (a non-GAAP financial measure) decreased to $(944) million in 2018 from $190 million in 2017 , primarily due to higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures increased 63% to $3.17 billion in 2018 , reflecting higher planned investments in our ChoiceLease and commercial rental fleets. Our debt balance of $6.62 billion at December 31, 2018 , increased 22% from the prior year. Our debt to equity ratio increased to 228% from 191% in 2017 . The increase in our debt balance and in our debt to equity ratio reflects higher planned vehicle capital spending as well as acquisitions. We increased our annualized dividend rate by 17% to $2.16 per share of common stock during 2018 . 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) 2019 Outlook In 2019 , we anticipate solid earnings growth across all business segments. Higher expected earnings are driven by contractual revenue growth from record sales results in 2018 as well as the strength of our sales pipeline. We forecast record ChoiceLease fleet growth of 11,000 vehicles, driven by a continued trend toward outsourcing, our ongoing sales and marketing initiatives, and expansion with existing customers. We expect solid rental revenue growth, primarily in the expanding light- and medium-duty truck markets. In DTS and SCS, we expect revenue growth and margin expansion due to improved operating performance. Overall used vehicle results are expected to be modestly lower than the prior year due to slightly lower market pricing expectations on increased volumes. We continue to reduce our long-term residual value estimates on vehicles in operation and accelerating depreciation on vehicles we expect to make available for sale through mid-2020. We are planning significantly higher capital expenditures in 2019 , primarily due to increased investments to grow and refresh our lease fleet, more than offsetting decreased rental capital spending. We expect to deliver higher operating cash flow of $2 billion , reflecting the returns from several years of fleet investment. Free cash flow is forecast at negative $1.1 billion , reflecting increased capital spending to support contractual fleet growth and replacement. We are in the process of embarking on a multi-year Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) project. This new system is designed to improve efficiencies and integrate and automate certain internal financial, operating, and other applications that are critical to our business operations. Ryder will adopt a new lease accounting standard effective January 1, 2019 . The new standard changes the timing of revenue recognition to better align with maintenance costs. Maintenance costs increase as vehicles age and, accordingly, maintenance revenue will be recognized as costs are expected to be incurred resulting in deferred maintenance revenue, with the most significant deferral taking place during the first several years of new equipment contracts due to lower maintenance costs. Historically, approximately 35% of ChoiceLease revenue relates to maintenance and is subject to deferred recognition. The new standard will impact Ryder consolidated financial position and results of operations on a one-time and ongoing basis. There will be no impact on cash flow or earnings over the life of the lease contract. A deferred revenue balance will be established to reflect the adjusted recognition pattern of our maintenance related revenue for Ryder ChoiceLease product as if it had been accounted for under the standard since inception. We expect the one-time, after-tax cumulative effect adjustment to recognize deferred revenue to have a material impact by reducing shareholders equity. The annual impact to results will vary depending on, among other factors, distribution of lease fleet by age, vehicle/type lease term and percentages of leases fulfilled with new versus used vehicles. Going forward, earnings volatility associated with lease fleet age is expected to be reduced as maintenance revenue will be more aligned with maintenance costs. As a result of the impact from the lease accounting standard, we are revising our debt to equity leverage target to 250-300% from the prior target of 200-250%. These statements are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We caution readers that certain important factors could cause actual results and events to differ significantly from those expressed. For a detailed description of certain of these risk factors, please see Item 1A-Risk Factors of this Annual Report. 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) FULL YEAR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Revenue and cost of revenue by source Total revenue increased 15% in 2018 to $8.41 billion and increased 8% in 2017 to $7.30 billion . Operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) increased 11% in 2018 to $6.69 billion and increased 4% in 2017 to $6.04 billion . The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: 2018 2017 Total Operating Total Operating Organic, including price and volume 11% 10% 7% 4% Acquisitions 2 1 Fuel 2 1 Total increase 15% 11% 8% 4% Lease and Rental Change 2018 2017 2016 2018/2017 2017/2016 (Dollars in thousands) Lease and rental revenues $ 3,508,136 3,237,685 3,170,952 8% 2% Cost of lease and rental 2,566,257 2,355,043 2,234,284 9% 5% Gross margin 941,879 882,642 936,668 7% (6)% Gross margin % 27 % 27 % 30 % Lease and rental revenues represent ChoiceLease and commercial rental product offerings within our FMS business segment. Revenues increased 8% in 2018 and 2% in 2017 , from higher ChoiceLease revenue, driven by growth in the average ChoiceLease fleet (up 4% in 2018 and 2% in 2017 ) and higher prices on replacement vehicles. Lease and rental revenue growth in 2018 also reflects higher commercial rental revenue driven by stronger demand and higher pricing. ChoiceLease revenue growth in 2017 was partially offset by lower commercial rental revenue reflecting weaker demand. Cost of lease and rental represents the direct costs related to lease and rental revenues. These costs are comprised of depreciation of revenue earning equipment, maintenance costs (primarily repair parts and labor), and other fixed costs such as licenses, insurance and operating taxes. Cost of lease and rental excludes interest costs from vehicle financing, which are reported within "Interest expense" in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Cost of lease and rental increased 9% in 2018 and 5% in 2017 . In both years, cost of lease and rental reflected higher depreciation and maintenance costs due to a larger average lease fleet, depreciation policy changes and accelerated depreciation of $39 million in 2018 and $30 million in 2017 . In 2018 , depreciation and maintenance costs also increased from a larger average rental fleet. In 2017 , higher depreciation and maintenance costs in the lease fleet were offset by lower depreciation and maintenance on a smaller average rental fleet, and maintenance spending also increased as the number of vehicles being prepared for sale returned to more normal levels and due to an increase in the age of the fleet. Changes in estimated residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment effective January 1 of each respective year negatively impacted cost of lease and rental by $40 million in 2018 and $4 million in 2017 . Lease and rental gross margin increased 7% and gross margin as a percentage of revenue stayed flat at 27% in 2018 . The 2018 increase in gross margin dollars was due to increased commercial rental utilization, reflecting strong demand, and lease fleet growth, partially offset by higher depreciation from residual value changes as well as accelerated depreciation and higher maintenance costs on certain older model vehicles. Lease and rental gross margin decreased 6% and gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 27% in 2017 , due to increased maintenance costs, accelerated depreciation and lower commercial rental demand. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Services Change 2018 2017 2016 2018/2017 2017/2016 (Dollars in thousands) Services revenue $ 4,280,834 3,538,869 3,123,448 21% 13% Cost of services 3,655,794 2,970,803 2,574,132 23% 15% Gross margin 625,040 568,066 549,316 10% 3% Gross margin % 15 % 16 % 18 % Services revenue represents all the revenues associated with our DTS and SCS business segments as well as SelectCare with our FMS business segment. Services revenue increased 21% in 2018 and 13% in 2017 due to new business, increased volumes and higher pricing in SCS and DTS. Services revenue also reflects the MXD acquisition and benefits from higher fuel costs passed through to our DTS and SCS customers in both periods. Cost of services represents the direct costs related to services revenue and is primarily comprised of salaries and employee-related costs, subcontracted transportation (purchased transportation from third parties), maintenance costs and fuel. Cost of services increased 23% and 15% in 2018 and 2017 , respectively, due to higher volumes and higher fuel costs. Services gross margin increased 10 % and 3% in 2018 and 2017 , respectively, reflecting benefits from revenue growth in our DTS and SCS segments. In 2018 , benefits from revenue growth were partially offset by higher costs incurred during the start-up phase of a new DTS customer account. In 2017 , benefits from revenue growth were partially offset by lower operating performance on certain SCS contracts and increased maintenance costs on certain older model year vehicles in DTS. Services gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 15% in 2018 , reflecting a change in the mix of business. Services gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 16% in 2017 , reflecting lower operating performance on certain SCS contracts and higher vehicle maintenance costs in DTS. Fuel Change 2018 2017 2016 2018/2017 2017/2016 (Dollars in thousands) Fuel services revenue $ 620,245 520,500 463,738 19% 12% Cost of fuel services 605,613 507,440 448,306 19% 13% Gross margin 14,632 13,060 15,432 12% (15)% Gross margin % 2 % 3 % 3 % Fuel services revenue represents fuel services provided to our FMS customers. Fuel services revenue increased 19% in 2018 and 12% in 2017 due to higher fuel costs passed through to customers. Cost of fuel services includes the direct costs associated with providing our customers with fuel. These costs include fuel, salaries and employee-related costs of fuel island attendants and depreciation of our fueling facilities and equipment. Cost of fuel services increased 19% in 2018 and 13% in 2017 due to higher fuel costs. Fuel services gross margin increased 12% in 2018 and decreased 15% in 2017 . Fuel services gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 2% in 2018 and remained at 3% in 2017 . Fuel is largely a pass-through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in margin during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, fuel services margin is impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel is established based on trailing market fuel costs. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Change 2018 2017 2016 2018/2017 2017/2016 (In thousands) Other operating expenses $ 125,323 115,507 113,461 8% 2% Other operating expenses include costs related to our owned and leased facilities within the FMS business segment such as depreciation, rent, insurance, utilities and taxes. These facilities are utilized to provide maintenance to our FMS customers. Other operating expenses increased in 2018 due to higher facility maintenance and weather-related utility costs. Other operating expenses in 2017 were largely in line with the results from the year-earlier period. Change 2018 2017 2016 2018/2017 2017/2016 (Dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 854,807 871,224 804,229 (2)% 8% Percentage of total revenue 10 % 12 % 12 % SG&A expenses decreased 2% in 2018 and increased 8% in 2017 . SG&A expenses as a percent of total revenue decreased to 10% in 2018 after remaining at 12% in 2017 . The 2018 decrease was primarily due to cost savings initiatives implemented during 2018 and lower compensation-related costs. The increase in 2017 was due to higher compensation-related costs and professional fees, as well as a $5 million estimated pension settlement charge for the exit from a U.S. multi-employer pension plan. Change 2018 2017 2016 2018/2017 2017/2016 (In thousands) Non-operating pension costs $ 7,541 27,741 37,593 (73)% (26)% Non-operating pension costs includes the components of our net periodic benefit cost other than service cost. These components include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial loss and prior service cost. Non-operating pension costs decreased by $20 million in 2018 , due to the benefit of favorable asset returns in 2017 and lower interest rates, partially offset by a pension settlement charge of $3 million related to employee benefit settlements from our U.K. pension plan. Non-operating pension costs decreased by $10 million in 2017 , primarily due to a one-time charge of $8 million in 2016 to reflect 2009 pension benefit improvements that were not fully reflected in our pension benefit obligation. Change 2018 2017 2016 2018/2017 2017/2016 (In thousands) Used vehicle sales, net $ (21,739 ) (17,241 ) 972 (26)% NM Used vehicle sales, net includes gains from sales of used vehicles, selling costs associated with used vehicles and write-downs of vehicles held for sale to fair market value. Used vehicle sales, net declined to a loss of $22 million in 2018 , due to lower gains from sales of used vehicles driven by the mix and volume of units sold in the current year, partially offset by lower inventory valuation adjustments. Used vehicle sales, net decreased to a loss of $17 million in 2017 , due to a drop in the market value of trucks and tractors, which resulted in lower gains on sales of used vehicles and higher fair market value write-downs. Global average proceeds per unit in 2018 increased for both tractors and trucks primarily due to a higher mix of retail sales, as well as lower average age of vehicles sold and improved market pricing. The following table presents the used vehicle pricing changes for 2018 and 2017 compared with the respective prior years: Proceeds per unit change 2018/2017 2017/2016 Tractors 12 % (12 )% Trucks 9 % (12 )% 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Change 2018 2017 2016 2018/2017 2017/2016 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $ 178,560 140,350 147,843 27% (5)% Effective interest rate 3.0 % 2.6 % 2.7 % Interest expense increased 27% to $179 million in 2018 , reflecting a higher effective interest rate and higher average outstanding debt. The higher effective interest rate in 2018 reflects the replacement of lower fixed interest rate debt with debt issuances at higher fixed rates as well as the impact on variable rate debt of an increasing interest rate environment. The increase in average outstanding debt reflects higher planned vehicle capital spending as well as acquisitions. Interest expense decreased 5% to $140 million in 2017 , reflecting a lower average outstanding debt level and a lower effective interest rate. The lower average outstanding debt level in 2017 reflects lower vehicle capital spending. The lower effective interest rate in 2017 reflects the replacement of higher interest rate debt with debt issuances at lower fixed rates. 2018 2017 2016 (In thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $ 5,387 44,245 13,068 Refer to Note 28 , Miscellaneous Income, Net in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the changes in miscellaneous income, net. 2018 2017 2016 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 25,107 21,405 5,074 Refer to Note 5 , Restructuring and Other Charges, Net in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

In the aggregate, these items reduced the effective rate by 1.1% in 2018 , 188.2% in 2017 and 0.8% in 2016 . In 2018 , the effective tax rate also decreased due to a lower federal rate associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Refer to Note 14 , Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 33 ITEM 7.

Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this MD&A for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue, and segment total revenue to segment operating revenue for FMS, DTS and SCS, as well as the reasons why management believes these measures are important to investors. As part of management evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as EBT from continuing operations, which includes an allocation of Central Support Services (CSS), and excludes non-operating pension costs, restructuring and other items, net, as described in Note 5 , Restructuring and Other Charges, Net , and the items discussed in Note 25 , Other Items Impacting Comparability , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance and procurement, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal, marketing and corporate communications. The objective of the EBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS, including costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29 , Segment Reporting , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the methodology for allocating the remainder of CSS costs to the business segments. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Inter-segment revenue and EBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. EBT related to inter-segment equipment and services billed to DTS and SCS customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the segment that served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations in the table above). Refer to Note 29 , " Segment Reporting " in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

A reconciliation of FMS total revenue to FMS operating revenue as well as the reasons why management believes this measure is important to investors is included in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section of this MD&A. 2018 versus 2017 ChoiceLease revenue increased 6% in 2018 , reflecting a larger average fleet size and higher prices on replacement vehicles. The average number of ChoiceLease vehicles increased 4% from the prior year, reflecting continued solid sales activity. We expect favorable ChoiceLease comparisons to continue next year due to the impact of a strong 2018 sales year, as well as expected sales in 2019. Commercial rental revenue increased 18% in 2018 due to stronger demand and higher pricing. We expect favorable commercial rental comparisons next year based on a continued strong demand environment but to a lesser extent than experienced in 2018 . SelectCare revenue increased 8% in 2018 due to sales activity and increased volumes. Fuel services revenue increased 23% in 2018 due to higher fuel costs passed through to customers. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) FMS EBT increased 4% in 2018 , primarily driven by growth in commercial rental and ChoiceLease, as well as cost savings initiatives implemented during 2018. These benefits were partially offset by higher depreciation of $40 million due to residual value changes and accelerated depreciation of $9 million to vehicles expected to be made available for sale through June 2020; higher compensation-related expenses, including commissions paid to fund growth; and unfavorable self-insurance developments. Commercial rental performance improved in 2018 , due to increased utilization reflecting stronger demand and higher pricing. Rental power fleet utilization was 79.2% in 2018 , up from 75.6% in 2017 , on a 10% larger average rental power fleet. ChoiceLease comparisons benefited from fleet growth. Used vehicle sales results declined $4 million , reflecting lower gains from sales of used vehicles due to the mix and volume of units sold, partially offset by lower inventory valuation adjustments. 2017 versus 2016 ChoiceLease revenue increased 4% in 2017 , reflecting a larger average fleet size and higher prices on replacement vehicles. The average number of ChoiceLease vehicles increased 2% from the prior year, reflecting continued solid sales activity. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% in 2017 due to lower demand. SelectCare revenue increased 3% in 2017 due to new business and higher volumes. Fuel services revenue increased 13% in 2017 due to higher fuel costs passed through to customers. FMS EBT decreased 16% in 2017 due to increased accelerated depreciation of $21 million , lower used vehicle sales and commercial rental results. These decreases were partially offset by improved SelectCare and ChoiceLease performance. The increase in accelerated depreciation reflects a full year of accelerated depreciation and the expansion of acceleration to vehicles expected to be made available for sale through June 2019. Used vehicle sales results declined $18 million primarily due to lower pricing. Commercial rental performance declined due to lower demand. However, rental power fleet utilization was 75.6% in 2017 , up from 74.7% in 2016 on a 6% smaller average rental power fleet, reflecting fleet right-sizing actions taken during the year. SelectCare performance was driven by new business and increased volumes. ChoiceLease comparisons benefited from growth in fleet size and higher per vehicle pricing.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) The totals in the previous table include the following non-revenue earning equipment for the global fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Change Number of Units 2018 2017 2016 2018/2017 2017/2016 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 4,500 2,900 1,700 55% 71% No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,900 6,000 7,500 15 (20) Other NLE units 4,300 3,400 4,400 26 (23) Total 15,700 12,300 13,600 28% (10)% NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2018 , the number of NYE units increased 55% compared with December 31, 2017 , reflecting lease fleet growth and a significant amount of deliveries close to the end of the year. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2018 , the number of NLE units increased 19% , reflecting higher used vehicle inventories and a higher number of vehicles being prepared for sale at the end of the year. We expect NLE units to increase in 2019 , as a result of higher expected used vehicle inventories driven by the lease replacement cycle.

DTS operating revenue increased 10% due to new business and increased volumes. DTS EBT increased 11% due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher costs incurred during the start-up phase of a new customer account. 2017 versus 2016 In 2017 , DTS total revenue increased 7% reflecting organic growth and, to a lesser extent, higher fuel costs passed through to our customers. DTS operating revenue increased 2% due to new business, increased volumes and higher pricing. DTS EBT decreased 12% due to higher insurance premiums, increased maintenance costs on certain older model year vehicles and higher labor costs from increased driver turnover. These items were partially offset by favorable developments of self-insurance claims from prior years.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from continuing operations: 2018 2017 2016 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,635,095 1,547,986 1,601,022 Financing activities 1,093,446 (155,115 ) (185,922 ) Investing activities (2,746,492 ) (1,365,504 ) (1,407,347 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash 4,694 (5,539 ) (9,482 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (13,257 ) 21,828 (1,729 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.64 billion in 2018 , compared with $1.55 billion in 2017 , reflecting higher pre-tax earnings. Cash provided by financing activities was $1.09 billion in 2018 , compared with cash used in financing activities of $155 million in 2017 , due to higher borrowing needs. Cash used in investing activities increased to $2.75 billion in 2018 , compared with $1.37 billion in 2017 , primarily due to increased capital expenditures. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased to $1.55 billion in 2017 , compared with $1.60 billion in 2016 , primarily reflecting the impact of lower comparable earnings. Cash used in financing activities totaled $155 million in 2017 , compared with $186 million in 2016 , driven by share repurchases and common stock dividends. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $1.37 billion in 2017 , compared with $1.41 billion in 2016 , primarily due to lower payments for capital expenditures and higher proceeds from operating property and equipment sales, partially offset by lower proceeds from revenue earning equipment sales. The following table shows the components of our free cash flow: 2018 2017 2016 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,635,095 1,547,986 1,601,022 Sales of revenue earning equipment (1) 379,716 376,743 414,249 Sales of operating property and equipment (1) 16,606 52,257 7,051 Collections on direct finance leases and other (1) 74,967 73,172 76,510 Total cash generated (2) 2,106,384 2,050,158 2,098,832 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1) (3,050,409 ) (1,860,436 ) (1,905,157 ) Free cash flow (2) $ (944,025 ) 189,722 193,675 Memo: Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 1,093,446 (155,115 ) (185,922 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (2,746,492 ) (1,365,504 ) (1,407,347 ) (1) Included in cash flows from investing activities. (2) Non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of net cash provided by operating activities to total cash generated and to free cash flow are set forth in this table. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this MD&A for the reasons why management believes these measures are important to investors. Free cash flow decreased to $(944) million in 2018 from $190 million in 2017 , primarily due to higher capital expenditures in 2018 . Free cash flow of $190 million in 2017 was level with $194 million in 2016 , primarily due to lower cash flows from operations, partially offset by lower cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment in 2017 . 46 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) We expect cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations to increase approximately $410 million to $2.0 billion in 2019 , due to pre-tax earnings growth adjusted for non-cash items, primarily depreciation. We expect 2019 free cash flow to decrease to negative $1.1 billion , reflecting capital spending to fund higher growth and replacement in the lease and rental vehicle fleets. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the ChoiceLease and commercial rental product lines. The level of capital required to support the ChoiceLease product line varies based on customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long-term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. We utilize capital for the purchase of vehicles in our commercial rental product line to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter-term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2018 2017 2016 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: ChoiceLease $ 2,206,500 1,456,758 1,547,717 Commercial rental 796,617 351,707 82,580 3,003,117 1,808,465 1,630,297 Operating property and equipment 162,154 132,752 132,603 Total capital expenditures (1) 3,165,271 1,941,217 1,762,900 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (114,862 ) (80,781 ) 142,257 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 3,050,409 1,860,436 1,905,157 _____________ (1) Non-cash additions exclude approximately $11 million , $7 million and $1 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures increased to $3.17 billion in 2018 , reflecting planned higher investments in the ChoiceLease and commercial rental fleets. Capital expenditures increased in 2017 to $1.94 billion , reflecting higher planned investments to refresh our commercial rental fleet, partially offset by lower ChoiceLease spending. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $3.6 billion in 2019 , primarily due to increased investments to grow and refresh our ChoiceLease fleet, more than offsetting decreased rental capital spending. We expect to fund 2019 capital expenditures primarily with additional debt financing. Working Capital 2018 2017 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,568,391 $ 1,322,893 Current liabilities 2,292,321 2,014,975 Working capital $ (723,930 ) $ (692,082 ) Our net working capital was negative $724 million at December 31, 2018 , compared with negative $692 million at December 31, 2017 . The decrease in net working capital was primarily due to higher payables from increased capital expenditures, partially offset by higher days receivable outstanding. Our global revolving credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital needs. See "Financing and Other Funding Transactions" for further discussion on the adequacy of our funding sources to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. 47 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset-based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long-term and medium-term public and private debt, asset-backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of unsecured commercial paper and medium-term notes. Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is impacted by both our short-term and long-term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short-term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper and likely require us to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, assuming ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings and rating outlooks at December 31, 2018 were as follows: Short-term Long-term Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Fitch Ratings F2 Stable A- Stable (affirmed October 2018) Standard & Poor Ratings Services A2 Stable BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2018) Moody Investors Service P2 Stable Baa1 Stable (affirmed May 2018) Cash and equivalents totaled $68 million as of December 31, 2018 . Approximately $17 million was held outside the U.S. as of December 31, 2018 , and is available to fund operations and other growth of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have historically reinvested such earnings overseas indefinitely and continue to reinvest future foreign earnings overseas indefinitely. Since the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act implements a territorial tax system, whereby certain foreign subsidiary earnings can be repatriated to the U.S. with no federal tax, we are continuously reassessing whether to indefinitely reinvest our overseas earnings. If we decide to repatriate cash and equivalents held outside the U.S., we may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. Refer to Note 14 , Income Taxes , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional discussion. We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to the public unsecured bond market, commercial paper market and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in the public unsecured debt market or the commercial paper market would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to public bonds, commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and/or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2018 , we had the following amounts available to fund operations: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $733 Trade receivables program $25 48 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Refer to Note 16 , Debt , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these debt facilities.The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2018 2017 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 5,409,651 5,391,274 Cash-related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings and revolving credit facilities 51,888 89,519 Proceeds from issuance of medium-term notes 1,490,805 595,785 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 479,815 277,517 Retirement of medium-term notes (650,000 ) (700,000 ) Other debt repaid (147,806 ) (262,577 ) Debt issuance costs paid (3,575 ) (1,738 ) 1,221,127 (1,494 ) Non-cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging (3,123 ) (8,302 ) Addition of capital lease obligations 10,701 7,057 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non-cash items (14,758 ) 21,116 Total changes in debt 1,213,947 18,377 Debt balance at December 31 $ 6,623,598 5,409,651 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to align the aggregate average remaining life of our vehicle-related debt with the aggregate average remaining life of our vehicle assets. We utilize both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to achieve this alignment and generally target a mix of 20% - 40% variable-rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable-rate portion of our total debt (including notional value of swap agreements) was 28% and 31% at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Ryder's debt to equity ratios were 228% and 191% at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The debt to equity ratio represents total debt divided by total equity. Our debt to equity ratio increased as of December 31, 2018 , due to increased debt to fund planned capital expenditures and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees. Refer to Note 18 , Guarantees , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our agreements involving guarantees. 49 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2018 : 2019 2020-2021 2022-2023 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 922,588 2,348,474 3,051,472 297,379 6,619,913 Capital lease obligations 7,364 6,552 3,403 4,453 21,773 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 929,952 2,355,026 3,054,875 301,832 6,641,686 Interest on debt (2) 200,636 275,628 144,794 27,817 648,875 Operating leases (3) 94,697 110,405 43,498 29,216 277,816 Purchase obligations (4) 1,095,090 29,515 7,331 5,221 1,137,157 Total contractual cash obligations 1,390,423 415,548 195,623 62,254 2,063,848 Insurance obligations (primarily self-insurance) 110,626 115,045 50,422 82,086 358,179 Other long-term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 12,612 9,510 6,783 58,288 87,193 Total $ 2,443,613 2,895,129 3,307,703 504,460 9,150,905 ____________ (1) Net of unamortized discount and excludes the fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable-rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2018 . Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay-as-you-go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long-term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2019 , our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by U.S. and international regulations and legislation (including ERISA), are expected to be $32 million . Our minimum funding requirements after 2019 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $365 million (pre-tax) (assuming expected long-term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay-as-you-go. See Note 23 , Employee Benefit Plans , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $63 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14 , Income Taxes , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 50 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Pension Information We have defined benefit retirement plans which are frozen for non-grandfathered and certain non-union employees in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2018 , total global pension contributions were $28 million compared with $41 million in 2017 . We estimate 2019 required pension contributions will be $32 million . The present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $318 million (pre-tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 23 , Employee Benefit Plans , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after-tax) of $712 million and $567 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The decline in funded status reflects the unfavorable asset returns of negative 6% in 2018 , partially offset by an increase in discount rates. Pension expense totaled $30 million in 2018 compared to $57 million in 2017 . The decrease in pension expense is due to the benefit of favorable asset returns in 2017 and lower expense for union-administered multi-employer plans, partially offset by the impact of lower discount rates. We expect 2019 pension expense to increase approximately $20 million primarily due to unfavorable asset returns in 2018 , partially offset by an increase in discount rate. Our 2019 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans section for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in certain U.S. multi-employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2018 , approximately 1,100 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current year MEP plan contributions total approximately $10 million . Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company-specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon certain requirements, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plan unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. During 2017, we recorded estimated pension settlement charges of $5 million related to our exit from a U.S. multi-employer pension plan. These charges were recorded within "Selling, general and administrative expenses" in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings and are included in the Union-administered plans expense. See Note 23 , Employee Benefit Plans , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 19 , Share Repurchase Programs , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $112 million in 2018 , $96 million in 2017 , and $91 million in 2016 . During 2018 , we increased our annualized dividend rate 17% to $2.16 per share of common stock. 51 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in short-term market interest rates would change annual pre-tax earnings by $16 million . We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed-rate and variable-rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 17 , Derivatives , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2018 , we had $4.16 billion of fixed-rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases and U.S. asset- backed securities) with a weighted-average interest rate of 3% and a fair value of $4.15 billion . A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2018 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $45 million at December 31, 2018 . Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2018 , we had $1.83 billion of variable-rate debt, including $725 million of fixed-rate debt instruments swapped to LIBOR-based floating-rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2018 , was a net liability of $10 million . The fair value of our variable-rate debt at December 31, 2018 , was $1.82 billion . A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2018 pre-tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $5 million . We are also subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would not materially impact results of operations. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the foreign currency exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we have no near-term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2018 , we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on trailing market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 24 , Environmental Matters , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 52 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryder Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2018 , a 10% decline in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2019 by approximately $123 million . We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long-term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and DTS and SCS applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis, we adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1 of each year. The approximate unfavorable impact on the annual depreciation expense resulting from the residual value and useful life reviews is as follows: 2019 2018 2017 ($30 million) ($40 million) ($4 million) In addition, we also monitor market trends throughout the year and assess residual values of vehicles expected to be sold in the near term and may adjust residual values for the vehicles. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Depreciation expense was $1.39 billion , $1.26 billion and $1.19 billion in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 11% in 2018 , driven by larger average lease and commercial rental fleets and accelerated depreciation on vehicles expected to be made available for sale through June 2020 of $9 million . Depreciation expense increased 6% in 2017 , driven by a larger average full service lease fleet and accelerated depreciation on vehicles expected to be made available for sale through June 2019 of $21 million , partially offset by a smaller average commercial rental fleet. 53 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on assets, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to estimate the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long-term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long-term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. Assumptions as to mortality of the participants in our pension plan is a key estimate in measuring the expected payments participants may receive over their lifetime, and therefore the amount of expense we will recognize. We update our mortality assumptions as deemed necessary by taking into consideration relevant actuarial studies as they become available as well as reassessing our own historical experience. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. Our U.S. pension investment policy and strategy seek to reduce the effects of future volatility on the fair value of our pension assets relative to our pension liabilities by increasing our allocation of high quality, longer-term fixed income securities and reducing our allocation of equity investments as the funded status of the plan improves. The composition of our pension assets was 46% equity securities and alternative assets and 54% debt securities and other investments at December 31, 2018 . We continually evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. In 2018 , we assessed our long-term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan and maintained the rate of 5.40% based on our expected asset mix. The expected rate of return assumption for the fixed income portion of our portfolio mirrors the discount rate in order to align the expected return on fixed income securities with the movement in the pension liability under our strategy. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre-tax accumulated actuarial loss of $930 million and $878 million at the end of 2018 and 2017 , respectively. To the extent the amount of cumulative actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or plan assets, the excess amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plan participants are inactive. As of December 31, 2018, the amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2019 and future years is $716 million . We expect to recognize approximately $32 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2019 . The effect on years beyond 2019 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans in future years. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2018 net pension expense is presented in Note 23 , Employee Benefit Plans , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2018 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2019 Net Pension Expense Effect on December 31, 2018 Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long-term rate of return on assets 5.40 % +/- 0.25 +/- $3.0 million N/A Discount rate 4.35 % +/- 0.25 +/- $4.0 million +/- $49 million 54 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Self-Insurance Accruals. Self-insurance accruals were $358 million and $349 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The majority of our self-insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , we recognized a charge of $1 million , a benefit of $9 million , and a charge of $9 million , respectively, from the development of estimated prior years self-insured loss reserves. Based on self-insurance accruals at December 31, 2018 , a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2019 by approximately $16 million . Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2018 , goodwill totaled $475 million . To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we are required to assess the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to its carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. We assess goodwill for impairment on October 1st of each year or more often if deemed necessary. Based on market conditions impacting our FMS Europe reporting unit's financial performance in the first quarter of 2018, we performed an interim impairment test as of March 31, 2018. Based on our analysis, we determined that all goodwill associated with our FMS Europe reporting unit was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $16 million. The impairment charge was recorded within Restructuring and other charges, net in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. On October 1, 2018, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test and determined there was no impairment in any of the other reporting units. We performed quantitative assessments on all of our reporting units as of October 1, 2018 and determined there was no impairment as of the assessment date. For quantitative tests, we estimated the fair value of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model. The principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model were projected operating results, weighted-average cost of capital, and terminal value. Based on our quantitative analysis as of October 1, 2018, we determined the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value resulting in no impairment to goodwill as of October 1, 2018. We estimated the fair value of the FMS North America reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 15%. Given this level of excess fair value, in the event the financial performance of FMS North America does not meet our expectations during 2019, we may be required to perform an interim impairment analysis prior to our next annual test, and based on the outcome of that analysis, could be required to take a non-cash impairment charge. As of October 1, 2018, there was $ 243 million of goodwill recorded related to FMS North America. As of December 31, 2018 , there have been no events or changes in circumstances that indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment has occurred since the October 1, 2018 assessment date. 55 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are temporary, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years, for which we have already recognized the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets were $676 million and $446 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. We recognize a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $16 million and $19 million , respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on management expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. We accrue the largest amount of the benefit that has a cumulative probability of greater than 50% of being sustained. These accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position has been determined to be more likely than not of being sustained, (2) the tax position, amount and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. See Note 14 , Income Taxes , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2 , Recent Accounting Pronouncements , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 56 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) NON-GAAP AND SEGMENT FINANCIAL MEASURES Non-GAAP Financial Measures. This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information that is not required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain elements of this information are considered non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. Also, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to financial measures used by other companies. We provide a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure in this non-GAAP financial measures section. We also provide the reasons why management believes each non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in this section. Specifically, we refer to the following non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K: Non-GAAP Financial Measure Comparable GAAP Measure Operating Revenue Measures: Operating Revenue Total Revenue FMS Operating Revenue FMS Total Revenue DTS Operating Revenue DTS Total Revenue SCS Operating Revenue SCS Total Revenue FMS EBT as a % of FMS Operating Revenue FMS EBT as a % of FMS Total Revenue DTS EBT as a % of DTS Operating Revenue DTS EBT as a % of DTS Total Revenue SCS EBT as a % of SCS Operating Revenue SCS EBT as a % of SCS Total Revenue Comparable Earnings Measures: Comparable Earnings Before Income Tax Earnings Before Income Tax Comparable Earnings Earnings from Continuing Operations Comparable EPS EPS from Continuing Operations Adjusted Return on Average Capital (ROC) Not Applicable. However, the non-GAAP elements of the calculation have been reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures. A numerical reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted net earnings and average total debt and average shareholder's equity to adjusted average total capital is provided on page 64. Cash Flow Measures: Total Cash Generated and Free Cash Flow Cash Provided by Operating Activities 57 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Set forth in the table below is an overview of each non-GAAP financial measure and why management believes that presentation of each non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. See reconciliations for each of these measures following this table. Operating Revenue Measures: Operating Revenue FMS Operating Revenue DTS Operating Revenue SCS Operating Revenue FMS EBT as a % of FMS Operating Revenue DTS EBT as a % of DTS Operating Revenue SCS EBT as a % of SCS Operating Revenue Operating revenue is defined as total revenue for Ryder System, Inc. or each business segment (FMS, DTS and SCS), respectively, excluding any (1) fuel and (2) subcontracted transportation. We believe operating revenue provides useful information to investors as we use it to evaluate the operating performance of our core businesses and as a measure of sales activity at the consolidated level for Ryder System, Inc., as well as for each of our business segments. We also use segment EBT as a percentage of segment operating revenue for each business segment for the same reason. Note: FMS EBT, DTS EBT and SCS EBT, our primary measures of segment performance, are not non-GAAP measures. Fuel : We exclude FMS, DTS and SCS fuel from the calculation of our operating revenue measures, as fuel is an ancillary service that we provide our customers, which is impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, and the costs are largely a pass-through to our customers, resulting in minimal changes in our profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by rapid changes in market fuel prices during a short period of time, as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on trailing market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation : We also exclude subcontracted transportation from the calculation of our operating revenue measures, as these services are also typically a pass-through to our customers and, therefore, fluctuations result in minimal changes to our profitability. While our DTS and SCS business segments subcontract certain transportation services to third party providers, our FMS business segment does not engage in subcontracted transportation and, therefore, this item is not applicable to FMS. Comparable Earnings Measures: Comparable earnings before income tax (EBT) Comparable Earnings Comparable earnings per diluted common share (EPS)Comparable Earnings Adjusted Return on Average Capital (ROC) Comparable EBT, comparable earnings and comparable EPS are defined, respectively, as GAAP EBT, earnings and EPS, all from continuing operations, excluding (1) non-operating pension costs and (2) any other significant items that are not representative of our business operations. We believe these comparable earnings measures provide useful information to investors and allow for better year-over-year comparison of operating performance. Non-Operating Pension Costs : Our comparable earnings measures exclude non-operating pension costs, which include the amortization of net actuarial loss and prior service cost, interest cost and expected return on plan assets components of pension and postretirement benefit costs. We exclude non-operating pension costs because we consider these to be impacted by financial market performance and outside the operational performance of our business. Other Significant Items : Our comparable earnings measures also exclude other significant items that are not representative of our business operations as detailed in the reconciliation table below page 60. These other significant items vary from period to period and, in some periods, there may be no such significant items. Calculation of comparable tax rate : The comparable provision for income taxes is computed using the same methodology as the GAAP provision for income taxes. Income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated based on the statutory tax rates of the jurisdictions to which the non-GAAP adjustments relate. Adjusted ROC: Adjusted ROC is defined as adjusted net earnings divided by average total capital and represents the rate of return generated by the capital deployed in our business. The adjustments represent the comparable items described above, which are excluded, as applicable, from the calculation of net earnings and average shareholders' equity (a component of average total capital). We use adjusted ROC as an internal measure of how effectively we use the capital invested (borrowed or owned) in our operations. 58 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Cash Flow Measures: Total Cash Generated Free Cash Flow We consider total cash generated and free cash flow to be important measures of comparative operating performance, as our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Total Cash Generated : Total cash generated is defined as the sum of (1) net cash provided by operating activities, (2) net cash provided by the sale of revenue earning equipment (3) net cash provided by the sale of operating property and equipment, (4) collections on direct finance leases and (5) other cash inflows from investing activities. We believe total cash generated is an important measure of total cash flows generated from our ongoing business activities. Free Cash Flow : We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) from continuing operations as free cash flow . We calculate free cash flow as the sum of (1) net cash provided by operating activities, (2) net cash provided by the sale of revenue earning equipment, (3) net cash provided by the sale of operating property and equipment, (4) collections on direct finance leases, and (5) other cash inflows from investing activities, less (6) purchases of property and revenue earning equipment. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders, after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. 59 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) The following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP earnings before taxes (EBT), earnings, and earnings per diluted share (EPS) from continuing operations to comparable EBT, comparable earnings and comparable EPS from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .

We caution readers that certain important factors could cause actual results and events to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. These risk factors include, but are not limited to, the following: Market Conditions: Changes in general economic and financial conditions in the U.S. and worldwide leading to decreased demand for our services, lower profit margins, increased levels of bad debt and reduced access to credit and financial markets. Decreases in freight demand which would impact both our transactional and variable-based contractual business. 66 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Changes in our customers operations, financial condition or business environment that may limit their demand for, or ability to purchase, our services. Decreases in market demand affecting the commercial rental market and used vehicle sales as well as global economic conditions. Volatility in customer volumes and shifting customer demand in the industries serviced by our SCS business. Changes in current financial, tax or regulatory requirements that could negatively impact our financial results. Competition: Advances in technology may impact demand for our services or may require increased investments to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments. Competition from other service providers, some of which have greater capital resources or lower capital costs, or from our customers, who may choose to provide services themselves. Continued consolidation in the markets in which we operate which may create large competitors with greater financial resources. Our inability to maintain current pricing levels due to economic conditions, demand for services, customer acceptance or competition. Profitability: Our inability to obtain adequate profit margins for our services Lower than expected sales volumes or customer retention levels Decreases in commercial rental fleet utilization and pricing Lower than expected used vehicle sales pricing levels and fluctuations in the anticipated proportion of retail versus wholesale sales Loss of key customers in our DTS and SCS business segments Our inability to adapt our product offerings to meet changing consumer preferences on a cost-effective basis The inability of our legacy information technology systems to provide timely access to data Sudden changes in fuel prices and fuel shortages Higher prices for vehicles, diesel engines and fuel as a result of new environmental standards Higher than expected maintenance costs and lower than expected benefits associated with our maintenance initiatives Our inability to successfully execute our asset management initiatives, maintain our fleet at normalized levels and right-size our fleet in line with demand Our key assumptions and pricing structure of our DTS and SCS contracts prove to be inaccurate Increased unionizing, labor strikes and work stoppages Difficulties in attracting and retaining drivers and technicians due to driver and technician shortages, which may result in higher costs to procure drivers and technicians and higher turnover rates affecting our customers Our inability to manage our cost structure Our inability to limit our exposure for customer claims Unfavorable or unanticipated outcomes in legal or regulatory proceedings or uncertain positions Business interruptions or expenditures due to severe weather or natural occurrences Financing Concerns: Higher borrowing costs Unanticipated interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations Negative funding status of our pension plans caused by lower than expected returns on invested assets and unanticipated changes in interest rates Withdrawal liability as a result of our participation in multi-employer plans Instability in U.S. and worldwide credit markets, resulting in higher borrowing costs and/or reduced access to credit 67 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued) Accounting Matters: Reductions in residual values or useful lives of revenue earning equipment Increases in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality resulting in higher pension expense; regulatory changes affecting pension estimates, accruals and expenses Changes in accounting rules, assumptions and accruals Difficulties in implementing appropriate accounting and business processes to comply with the disclosure requirements of the new lease accounting standard Other risks detailed from time to time in our SEC filings, including in Item 1A.-Risk Factors of this Annual Report.
